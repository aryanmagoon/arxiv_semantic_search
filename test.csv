What are the conditions for the probability of stabilization of the automaton?,"  We consider random boolean cellular automata on the integer lattice, i.e.,
the cells are identified with the integers from 1 to $N$. The behaviour of the
automaton is mainly determined by the support of the random variable that
selects one of the sixteen possible Boolean rules, independently for each cell.
A cell is said to stabilize if it will not change its state anymore after some
time. We classify the random boolean automata according to the positivity of
their probability of stabilization. Here is an example of a consequence of our
results: if the support contains at least 5 rules, then asymptotically as $N$
tends to infinity the probability of stabilization is positive, whereas there
exist random boolean cellular automata with 4 rules in their support for which
this probability tends to 0.

What is the redshift of the BL Lacertae object 1ES1011+496?,"  We report on the discovery of Very High Energy (VHE) gamma-ray emission from
the BL Lacertae object 1ES1011+496. The observation was triggered by an optical
outburst in March 2007 and the source was observed with the MAGIC telescope
from March to May 2007. Observing for 18.7 hr we find an excess of 6.2 sigma
with an integrated flux above 200 GeV of (1.58$\pm0.32) 10^{-11}$ photons
cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$. The VHE gamma-ray flux is >40% higher than in March-April
2006 (reported elsewhere), indicating that the VHE emission state may be
related to the optical emission state. We have also determined the redshift of
1ES1011+496 based on an optical spectrum that reveals the absorption lines of
the host galaxy. The redshift of z=0.212 makes 1ES1011+496 the most distant
source observed to emit VHE gamma-rays up to date.

What is the tight-bridge structure in the adsorption of benzene on a clean Si surface?,"  The structures and energetics of organic molecules adsorbed onto clean and
H-passivated Si(001)-(2$\times$1) surfaces have been calculated using density
functional theory. For benzene adsorbed on the clean Si surface the
tight-bridge structure was found to be stable and the butterfly structure
metastable. Both carbonic acid H$_2$CO$_3$ and propane C$_3$H$_8$ dissociate on
contact with the surface. Passivation of the Si surface with H-atoms has a
dramatic effect on the surface properties. The passivated surface is very inert
and the binding energy of all the molecules is very weak.
"
What are the performance indices used for the design of serial manipulators?,"  Various performance indices are used for the design of serial manipulators.
One method of optimization relies on the condition number of the Jacobian
matrix. The minimization of the condition number leads, under certain
conditions, to isotropic configurations, for which the roundoff-error
amplification is lowest. In this paper, the isotropy conditions, introduced
elsewhere, are the motivation behind the introduction of isotropic sets of
points. By connecting together these points, we define families of isotropic
manipulators. This paper is devoted to planar manipulators, the concepts being
currently extended to their spatial counterparts. Furthermore, only
manipulators with revolute joints are considered here.
"
What are the decay modes of the doubly charged Higgs boson and how can they be observed at the LHC?,"  We study the pair production of doubly charged Higgs bosons at the Large
Hadron Collider (LHC), assuming the doubly charged Higgs to be part of an
SU(2)_L triplet which generates Majorana masses for left-handed neutrinos. Such
pair-production has the advantage that it is not constrained by the triplet
vacuum expectation value, which tends to make the single production rate rather
small. We point out that, in addition to the Drell-Yan (DY) production
mechanism, two-photon processes also contribute to H++H++ production at a level
comparable to the QCD corrections to the DY channel. Decays of the doubly
charged Higgs into both the l+l+ and W+W+ modes are studied in detail to
optimize the signal observation over the backgrounds. Doubly charged scalars
should be observable at the LHC with 300 fb^-1 integrated luminosity in the ll
channel upto the mass range of 1 TeV even with a branching fraction of about 60
%, and in the WW channel upto a mass of 700 GeV. Such a doubly charged Higgs,
if it is a member of a triplet generating neutrino masses,cannot be long-lived
on the scale of collider detectors although it might lead to a displaced
secondary vertex during its decay if it is lighter than about 250 GeV.
"
What are the challenges in automatically generating Swift/XRT light curves of GRBs?,"  Context. Swift data are revolutionising our understanding of Gamma Ray
Bursts. Since bursts fade rapidly, it is desirable to create and disseminate
accurate light curves rapidly.
  Aims. To provide the community with an online repository of X-ray light
curves obtained with Swift. The light curves should be of the quality expected
of published data, but automatically created and updated so as to be
self-consistent and rapidly available. Methods. We have produced a suite of
programs which automatically generates Swift/XRT light curves of GRBs. Effects
of the damage to the CCD, automatic readout-mode switching and pile-up are
appropriately handled, and the data are binned with variable bin durations, as
necessary for a fading source.
  Results. The light curve repository website
(http://www.swift.ac.uk/xrt_curves) contains light curves, hardness ratios and
deep images for every GRB which Swift's XRT has observed. When new GRBs are
detected, light curves are created and updated within minutes of the data
arriving at the UK Swift Science Data Centre.
"
What is the behavior of the transition energy of [11k] grown InAs QDs?,"  Using three-dimensional k.p calculation including strain and
piezoelectricity, we showed that the size of the quantum dot (QD) in the growth
direction determines the influence of the (In,Ga)As capping layer on the
optical properties of [11k] grown InAs QDs, where k=1,2,3. For flat dots,
increase of In concentration in the capping layer leads to a decrease of the
transition energy, as is the case of [001] grown QDs, whereas for large dots an
increase of the In concentration in the capping layer is followed by an
increase of the transition energy up to a critical concentration of In, after
which the optical transition energy starts to decrease.
"
What is the impact of neglecting non-thermal recombination onto heavy elements on HXR spectra and electron diagnostics?,"  Context. Flare Hard X-Rays (HXRs) from non-thermal electrons are commonly
treated as solely bremsstrahlung (f-f), recombination (f-b) being neglected.
This assumption is shown to be substantially in error, especially in hot
sources, mainly due to recombination onto Fe ions.
  Aims. We analyse the effects on HXR spectra and electron diagnostics by
including non-thermal recombination onto heavy elements in our model.
  Methods. Using Kramers hydrogenic cross sections with effective Z, we
calculate f-f and f-b spectra for power-law electron spectra, in both thin and
thick target limits, and for Maxwellians, with summation over all important
ions.
  Results. We find that non-thermal electron recombination, especially onto Fe,
must, in general, be included together with f-f, for reliable spectral
interpretation, when the HXR source is hot. f-b contribution is greatest when
the electron spectral index is large, and any low energy cut-off small. f-b
spectra recombination edges mean a cut-off in F(E) appears as a HXR feature at
Photon energy = Ec + Vz, offering an Ec diagnostic. Including f-b lowers,
greatly in some cases, the F(E) needed for prescribed HXR fluxes and, even when
small, seriously distorts F(E) as inferred by inversion or forward fitting
based on f-f alone.
  Conclusions. f-b recombination from non-thermal electrons can be an important
contributor to HXR spectra and should be included in spectral analyses,
especially for hot sources. Accurate results will require use of better cross
sections than ours and consideration of source ionisation structure.
"
How is the anomalous Hall conductivity calculated using an ab-initio approach?,"  While the intrinsic anomalous Hall conductivity is normally written in terms
of an integral of the electronic Berry curvature over the occupied portions of
the Brillouin zone, Haldane has recently pointed out that this quantity (or
more precisely, its ``non-quantized part'') may alternatively be expressed as a
Fermi-surface property. Here we present an {\it ab-initio} approach for
computing the anomalous Hall conductivity that takes advantage of this
observation by converting the integral over the Fermi sea into a more efficient
integral on the Fermi surface only. First, a conventional electronic-structure
calculation is performed with spin-orbit interaction included.
Maximally-localized Wannier functions are then constructed by a post-processing
step in order to convert the {\it ab-initio} electronic structure around the
Fermi level into a tight-binding-like form. Working in the Wannier
representation, the Brillouin zone is sampled on a large number of equally
spaced parallel slices oriented normal to the total magnetization. On each
slice, we find the intersections of the Fermi-surface sheets with the slice by
standard contour methods, organize these into a set of closed loops, and
compute the Berry phases of the Bloch states as they are transported around
these loops. The anomalous Hall conductivity is proportional to the sum of the
Berry phases of all the loops on all the slices. Illustrative calculations are
performed for Fe, Co and Ni.
"
What is the relationship between the OVII absorption line strength and the ROSAT background emission measurement in the R45 band?,"  Million degree gas is present at near-zero redshift and is due either to a
gaseous Galactic Halo or a more diffuse but very massive Local Group medium. We
can discriminate between these models because the column densities should
depend on location in the sky, either relative to the Galaxy bulge or to the
M31-Milky Way axis. To search for these signatures, we measured the OVII Kalpha
absorption line strength toward 25 bright AGNs, plus LMC X-3, using XMM-Newton
RGS archival data. The data are in conflict with a purely Local Group model,
but support the Galactic Halo model. The strongest correlation is between the
OVII equivalent widths and the ROSAT background emission measurement in the R45
band (0.4-1 keV), for which OVII emission makes the largest single
contribution. This suggests that much of the OVII emission and absorption are
cospatial, from which the radius of a uniform halo appears to lie the range
15-110 kpc. The present data do not constrain the type of halo gas model and an
equally good fit is obtained in a model where the gas density decreases as a
power-law, such as r^(-3/2). For a uniform halo with a radius of 20 kpc, the
electron density would be 9E-4 cm^(-3), and the gas mass is 4E8 Msolar. The
redshift of the four highest S/N OVII measurements is consistent with a Milky
Way origin rather than a Local Group origin.
"
What are the physical properties of the neutral reflector in the Seyfert 2 galaxy NGC4945?,"  Suzaku observed a nearby Seyfert 2 galaxy NGC4945, which hosts one of the
brightest active galactic nuclei above 20 keV. Combining data from the X-ray
CCD camera (XIS) and the Hard X-ray Detector (HXD), the AGN intrinsic nuclear
emission and its reprocessed signals were observed simultaneously. The
intrinsic emission is highly obscured with an absorbing column of $\sim 5
\times 10^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$, and was detectable only above $\sim 10$ keV. The
spectrum below 10 keV is dominated by reflection continuum and emission lines
from neutral/ionized material. Along with a neutral iron K$\alpha$ line, a
neutral iron K$\beta$ and a neutral nickel K$\alpha$ line were detected for the
first time from this source. The neutral lines and the cold reflection
continuum are consistent with both originating in the same location. The
Compton down-scattered shoulder in the neutral Fe-K$\alpha$ line is $\sim 10%$
in flux of the narrow core, which confirms that the line originates from
reflection rather than transmission. The weakness of the Compton shoulder also
indicates that the reflector is probably seen nearly edge-on. Flux of the
intrinsic emission varied by a factor of $\sim 2$ within $\sim 20$ ks, which
requires the obscuring material to be geometrically thin. Broadband spectral
modeling showed that the solid angle of the neutral reflector is less than a
few $\times 10^{-2} \times 2\pi$. All this evidence regarding the reprocessed
signals suggests that a disk-like absorber/reflector is viewed from a near
edge-on angle.
"
What are the implications of these predictions on the LHC physics?,"  In the framework of percolation of strings, we present predictions for the
$R_{AA}$ and $R_{CP}$ for mesons and baryons and for $\bar{p}/\pi^{0}$ ratios
at LHC energies.
"
What is the process of wave conversion from a low-beta to a high-beta plasma?,"  Recent numerical investigations of wave propagation near coronal magnetic
null points (McLaughlin and Hood: Astron. Astrophys. 459, 641,2006) have
indicated how a fast MHD wave partially converts into a slow MHD wave as the
disturbance passes from a low-beta plasma to a high-beta plasma. This is a
complex process and a clear understanding of the conversion mechanism requires
the detailed investigation of a simpler model. An investigation of mode
conversion in a stratified, isothermal atmosphere, with a uniform, vertical
magnetic field is carried out, both numerically and analytically. In contrast
to previous investigations of upward-propagating waves (Zhugzhda and Dzhalilov:
Astron. Astrophys. 112, 16, 1982a; Cally: Astrophys. J. 548, 473, 2001), this
paper studies the downward propagation of waves from a low-beta to high-beta
environment. A simple expression for the amplitude of the transmitted wave is
compared with the numerical solution.
"
How can the properties of carbon nitride (CNx) be tailored for tribological applications?,"  In this chapter we review our findings on the bonding structure and growth
mechanisms of carbon-based thin solid films with fullerene-like (FL)
microstructure. The so-called FL arrangements arise from the curvature and
cross-linking of basal planes in graphitic-like structures, partially
resembling that of molecular fullerenes. This three-dimensional superstructure
takes advantage of the strength of planar pi bonds in sp2 hybrids and confers
the material interesting mechanical properties, such as high hardness, high
elastic recovery, low-friction and wear-resistance. These properties can be
tailored by controlling the curvature, size and connectivity of the FL
arrangements, making these materials promising coatings for tribological
applications. We have focused our interest mostly on carbon nitride (CNx) since
nitrogen promotes the formation of FL arrangements at low substrate
temperatures and they are emerging over pure carbon coatings in tribological
applications such as protective overcoats in magnetic hard disks. We address
structural issues such as origin of plane curvature, nature of the
cross-linking sites and sp2 clustering, together with growth mechanisms based
on the role of film-forming precursors, chemical re-sputtering or concurrent
ion assistance during growth.

"What is the result of an explicit computation of the cohomology of the Artin group of type B_n with coefficients over the module Q[q^{\pm 1},t^{\pm 1}]?","  The result of this paper is the determination of the cohomology of Artin
groups of type A_n, B_n and \tilde{A}_{n} with non-trivial local coefficients.
The main result is an explicit computation of the cohomology of the Artin group
of type B_n with coefficients over the module \Q[q^{\pm 1},t^{\pm 1}]. Here the
first (n-1) standard generators of the group act by (-q)-multiplication, while
the last one acts by (-t)-multiplication. The proof uses some technical results
from previous papers plus computations over a suitable spectral sequence. The
remaining cases follow from an application of Shapiro's lemma, by considering
some well-known inclusions: we obtain the rational cohomology of the Artin
group of affine type \tilde{A}_{n} as well as the cohomology of the classical
braid group {Br}_{n} with coefficients in the n-dimensional representation
presented in \cite{tong}. The topological counterpart is the explicit
construction of finite CW-complexes endowed with a free action of the Artin
groups, which are known to be K(\pi,1) spaces in some cases (including finite
type groups). Particularly simple formulas for the Euler-characteristic of
these orbit spaces are derived.
"
What are the non-classical states of two resonators that can be prepared using this technique?,"  We show that a continuous quantum non-demolition measurement of the energy of
a nanomechanical resonator can be achieved by monitoring the resonator with a
quantum point contact via a Cooper-pair box. This technique can further be used
to prepare highly non-classical states of two resonators, such as canonical
phase-reference states, and so-called ""noon"" states.
"
What is the meaning of the classical limit in quantum mechanics?,"  Quantum mechanics (QM) clearly violates Newton's First Law of Motion (NFLM)
in the quantum domain for one of the simplest problems, yielding an effect in a
force-free region much like the Aharonov-Bohm effect. In addition, there is an
incompatibility between the predictions of QM in the classical limit, and that
of classical mechanics (CM) with respect to NFLM. A general argument is made
that such a disparity may be found commonly for a wide variety of quantum
predictions in the classical limit. Alternatives to the Schrodinger equation
are considered that might avoid this problem. The meaning of the classical
limit is examined. Critical views regarding QM by Schrodinger, Bohm, Bell,
Clauser, and others are presented to provide a more complete perspective.
"
What is the effect of the dc conductivity of dielectric plates on the Casimir force?,"  We review recent results obtained in the physics of the thermal Casimir force
acting between two dielectrics, dielectric and metal, and between metal and
semiconductor. The detailed derivation for the low-temperature behavior of the
Casimir free energy, pressure and entropy in the configuration of two real
dielectric plates is presented. For dielectrics with finite static dielectric
permittivity it is shown that the Nernst heat theorem is satisfied. Hence, the
Lifshitz theory of the van der Waals and Casimir forces is demonstrated to be
consistent with thermodynamics. The nonzero dc conductivity of dielectric
plates is proved to lead to a violation of the Nernst heat theorem and, thus,
is not related to the phenomenon of dispersion forces. The low-temperature
asymptotics of the Casimir free energy, pressure and entropy are derived also
in the configuration of one metal and one dielectric plate. The results are
shown to be consistent with thermodynamics if the dielectric plate possesses a
finite static dielectric permittivity. If the dc conductivity of a dielectric
plate is taken into account this results in the violation of the Nernst heat
theorem. We discuss both the experimental and theoretical results related to
the Casimir interaction between metal and semiconductor with different charge
carrier density. Discussions in the literature on the possible influence of
spatial dispersion on the thermal Casimir force are analyzed. In conclusion,
the conventional Lifshitz theory taking into account only the frequency
dispersion remains the reliable foundation for the interpretation of all
present experiments.
"
What are the results of simulations of N=2 supersymmetric Wess-Zumino models with Wilson and SLAC derivatives?,"  We study and simulate N=2 supersymmetric Wess-Zumino models in one and two
dimensions. For any choice of the lattice derivative, the theories can be made
manifestly supersymmetric by adding appropriate improvement terms corresponding
to discretizations of surface integrals. In one dimension, our simulations show
that a model with the Wilson derivative and the Stratonovitch prescription for
this discretization leads to far better results at finite lattice spacing than
other models with Wilson fermions considered in the literature. In particular,
we check that fermionic and bosonic masses coincide and the unbroken Ward
identities are fulfilled to high accuracy. Equally good results for the
effective masses can be obtained in a model with the SLAC derivative (even
without improvement terms).
  In two dimensions we introduce a non-standard Wilson term in such a way that
the discretization errors of the kinetic terms are only of order O(a^2). Masses
extracted from the corresponding manifestly supersymmetric model prove to
approach their continuum values much quicker than those from a model containing
the standard Wilson term. Again, a comparable enhancement can be achieved in a
theory using the SLAC derivative.
"
Do web sites exhibit structural similarities in their internal link structure?,"  The topological structures of the Internet and the Web have received
considerable attention. However, there has been little research on the
topological properties of individual web sites. In this paper, we consider
whether web sites (as opposed to the entire Web) exhibit structural
similarities. To do so, we exhaustively crawled 18 web sites as diverse as
governmental departments, commercial companies and university departments in
different countries. These web sites consisted of as little as a few thousand
pages to millions of pages. Statistical analysis of these 18 sites revealed
that the internal link structure of the web sites are significantly different
when measured with first and second-order topological properties, i.e.
properties based on the connectivity of an individual or a pairs of nodes.
However, examination of a third-order topological property that consider the
connectivity between three nodes that form a triangle, revealed a strong
correspondence across web sites, suggestive of an invariant. Comparison with
the Web, the AS Internet, and a citation network, showed that this third-order
property is not shared across other types of networks. Nor is the property
exhibited in generative network models such as that of Barabasi and Albert.
"
What are the properties of the hyperbolic 3-simplex reflection groups?,"  A hyperbolic 3-simplex reflection group is a Coxeter group arising as a
lattice in the isometry group of hyperbolic 3-space, with fundamental domain a
geodesic simplex (possibly with some ideal vertices). The classification of
these groups is known, and there are exactly 9 cocompact examples, and 23
non-cocompact examples. We provide a complete computation of the lower
algebraic K-theory of the integral group ring of all the hyperbolic 3-simplex
reflection groups.
"
What are the critical properties of particle-hole symmetric and asymmetric SIT with dynamical exponent z=1 and z=2?,"  It is well known that bosons on an optical lattice undergo a second-order
superfluid-insulator transition (SIT) when the lattice potential increases. In
this paper we study SIT when fermions coexist with the bosons. We find that the
critical properties of particle-hole symmetric SIT with dynamical exponent z=1
is modified when fermions are present; it either becomes a fluctuation-driven
first order transition or a different second-order transition. On the other
hand the more generic particle-hole asymmetric (with z=2) SIT is stable against
coupling with fermions. We also discuss pairing interaction between fermions
mediated by quantum critical fluctuations near SIT.
"
What are the implications of the measurements of the charm-charm angular correlation at the CDF and D0 experiments?,"  Results for the production of charm and beauty quarks in proton anti-proton
collisions at ECM=1.96 TeV (Tevatron) with the two multi purpose experiments
CDF and D0 using an integrated luminosity of up to 1 fb^-1 are presented. With
the data measurement of the production me chanism for charm and beauty quarks
are done. These measurements are leading to a better understanding of the QCD
in the transition region between pertubative a nd nonpertubative QCD. The
charm-charm angular correlation is measured with D me sons at the CDF
experiment. The Quarkonium production for charm and beauty final state at D0
and CDF is discussed.
"
What are the types of static defects that the CAD framework can handle for CMOL architecture?,"  We present a CAD framework for CMOL, a hybrid CMOS/ molecular circuit
architecture. Our framework first transforms any logically synthesized circuit
based on AND/OR/NOT gates to a NOR gate circuit, and then maps the NOR gates to
CMOL. We encode the CMOL cell assignment problem as boolean conditions. The
boolean constraint is satisfiable if and only if there is a way to map all the
NOR gates to the CMOL cells. We further investigate various types of static
defects for the CMOL architecture, and propose a reconfiguration technique that
can deal with these defects through our CAD framework. This is the first
automated framework for CMOL cell assignment, and the first to model several
different CMOL static defects. Empirical results show that our approach is
efficient and scalable.
"
What is the relationship between the redshift of galaxies and the expansion of space?,"  The redshift of galaxies is in general explained by the expansion of space.
The flat space time theory of gravitation suggests an additional
interpretation. In this theory gravitation is explained analogously to
Maxwell's theory on a flat space-time metric and gravitation is described by a
field (potentials) with which the proper time (atomic time) is defined. In
addition to the proper time in the universe, the oberserver's time is stated.
The oberserver's time interval is absolute whereas the interval of the proper
time is time dependent. In particular, atomic clocks at distant objects are
going slower than clocks at present. This explains the redshift of distant
objects without assuming an expanding universe.
"
What are the implications of the results for the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics?,"  Studies of charm and beauty production in ep collisions with a center-of-mass
energy of 318 GeV are reported from the two HERA collaborations, H1 and ZEUS.
The analyses make use of both the HERA-I data sample recorded between 1996 and
2000 and a sample from HERA-II, which started in 2003. The cross sections
measured by both H1 and ZEUS experiments are compared with next-to-leading
order QCD calculations. The measurement of the charm and beauty contributions
to the proton structure function is also presented. The comparison to
next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) calculations shows agreement within the
errors.
"
What is the order of the largest complete minor in a graph G?,"  Let ccl(G) denote the order of the largest complete minor in a graph G (also
called the contraction clique number) and let G(n,p) denote a random graph on n
vertices with edge probability p. Bollobas, Catlin and Erdos asymptotically
determined ccl(G (n,p)) when p is a constant. Luczak, Pittel and Wierman gave
bounds on ccl(G(n,p)) when p is very close to 1/n, i.e. inside the phase
transition. Extending the results of Bollobas, Catlin and Erdos, we determine
ccl(G(n,p)) quite tightly, for p>C/n where C is a large constant. If p=C/n, for
an arbitrary constant C>1, then we show that asymptotically almost surely ccl(G
(n,p)) is of order square-root of n. This answers a question of Krivelevich and
Sudakov.
"
What are the equations of motion for geodesics in the neutral rotating Black Ring metric?,"  In this paper, the equations of motion for geodesics in the neutral rotating
Black Ring metric are derived and the separability of these equations is
considered. The bulk of the paper is concerned with sets of solutions where the
geodesic equations can be examined analytically - specifically geodesics
confined to the axis of rotation, geodesics restricted to the equatorial plane,
and geodesics that circle through the centre of the ring. The geodesics on the
rotational axis behave like a particle in a potential well, while the geodesics
confined to the equatorial plane mimic those of the Schwarzschild metric. It is
shown that it is impossible to have circular orbits that pass through the ring,
but some numerical results are presented which suggest that it is possible to
have bound orbits that circle through the ring.
"
Do the void statistics of red and blue galaxies depend on the environment in which the host halo formed?,"  We use measurements of the projected galaxy correlation function w_p and
galaxy void statistics to test whether the galaxy content of halos of fixed
mass is systematically different in low density environments. We present new
measurements of the void probability function (VPF) and underdensity
probability function (UPF) from Data Release Four of the Sloan Digital Sky
Survey, as well as new measurements of the VPF from the full data release of
the Two-Degree Field Galaxy Redshift Survey. We compare these measurements to
predictions calculated from models of the Halo Occupation Distribution (HOD)
that are constrained to match both w_p and the space density of galaxies. The
standard implementation of the HOD assumes that galaxy occupation depends on
halo mass only, and is independent of local environment. For luminosity-defined
samples, we find that the standard HOD prediction is a good match to the
observations, and the data exclude models in which galaxy formation efficiency
is reduced in low-density environments. More remarkably, we find that the void
statistics of red and blue galaxies (at L ~ 0.4L_*) are perfectly predicted by
standard HOD models matched to the correlation function of these samples,
ruling out ""assembly bias"" models in which galaxy color is correlated with
large-scale environment at fixed halo mass. We conclude that the luminosity and
color of field galaxies are determined predominantly by the mass of the halo in
which they reside and have little direct dependence on the environment in which
the host halo formed. In broader terms, our results show that the sizes and
emptiness of voids found in the distribution of L > 0.2L_* galaxies are in
excellent agreement with the predictions of a standard cosmological model with
a simple connection between galaxies and dark matter halos. (abridged)

Can there be independent higher level laws of nature if everything is reducible to the fundamental laws of physics?,"  Can there be independent higher level laws of nature if everything is
reducible to the fundamental laws of physics? The computer science notion of
level of abstraction explains why there can -- illustrating how computational
thinking can solve one of philosophy's most vexing problems.
"
"How do the properties of differentially rotating, main-sequence stars compare to those of nonrotating stars of the same mass?","  We conduct a systematic examination of the properties of models for
chemically homogeneous, differentially rotating, main-sequence stars of mass
1-2 M_sun. The models were constructed using a code based on a reformulation of
the self-consistent field method of computing the equilibrium stellar structure
for a specified conservative internal rotation law. [abridged] Relative to
nonrotating stars of the same mass, these models all have reduced luminosities
and effective temperatures, and flattened photospheric shapes (i.e., decreased
polar radii) with equatorial radii that can be larger or smaller, depending on
the degree of differential rotation. For a fixed ratio of the axial rotation
rate to the surface equatorial rotation rate, increasingly rapid rotation
generally deepens convective envelopes, shrinks convective cores, and can lead
to the presence of a convective core (envelope) in a 1 M_sun (2 M_sun) model, a
feature that is absent in a nonrotating star of the same mass. The positions of
differentially rotating models for a given mass M in the H-R diagram can be
shifted in such a way as to approximate the nonrotating ZAMS over ranges in
luminosity and effective temperature that correspond to a mass interval between
M and about 0.7 M. We briefly note a few of the implications of these results,
including (i) possible ambiguities arising from similarities between the
properties of rotating and nonrotating models of different masses, (ii) a
reduced radiative luminosity for a young, rapidly rotating Sun, (iii) the
nuclear destruction of lithium and other light metallic species in the layers
beneath an outer convective envelope, and (iv), the excitation of solar-like
oscillations and the operation of a solar-like hydromagnetic dynamo in some
1.5-2 M_sun stars.
"
What are the properties of the group of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms?,"  We show, by an elementary and explicit construction, that the group of
Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms of certain symplectic manifolds, endowed with
Hofer's metric, contains subgroups quasi-isometric to Euclidean spaces of
arbitrary dimension.
"
What is the statistical large sample theory used to analyze the computational complexity of Bayesian and quasi-Bayesian estimation?,"  In this paper we examine the implications of the statistical large sample
theory for the computational complexity of Bayesian and quasi-Bayesian
estimation carried out using Metropolis random walks. Our analysis is motivated
by the Laplace-Bernstein-Von Mises central limit theorem, which states that in
large samples the posterior or quasi-posterior approaches a normal density.
Using the conditions required for the central limit theorem to hold, we
establish polynomial bounds on the computational complexity of general
Metropolis random walks methods in large samples. Our analysis covers cases
where the underlying log-likelihood or extremum criterion function is possibly
non-concave, discontinuous, and with increasing parameter dimension. However,
the central limit theorem restricts the deviations from continuity and
log-concavity of the log-likelihood or extremum criterion function in a very
specific manner.
  Under minimal assumptions required for the central limit theorem to hold
under the increasing parameter dimension, we show that the Metropolis algorithm
is theoretically efficient even for the canonical Gaussian walk which is
studied in detail. Specifically, we show that the running time of the algorithm
in large samples is bounded in probability by a polynomial in the parameter
dimension $d$, and, in particular, is of stochastic order $d^2$ in the leading
cases after the burn-in period. We then give applications to exponential
families, curved exponential families, and Z-estimation of increasing

What is the Harder-Narasimhan filtration indexed by $\mathbb R$?,"  We establish in this article convergence results of normalized
Harder-Narasimhan polygons both in geometric and in arithmetic frameworks by
introducing the Harder-Narasimhan filtration indexed by $\mathbb R$ and the
associated Borel probability measure.
"
What is the evidence for tangential proper motions in the 6.0 GHz masers in W3(OH)?,"  Recent studies of methanol and ground-state OH masers at very high spectral
resolution have shed new light on small-scale maser processes. The nearby
source W3(OH), which contains numerous bright masers in several different
transitions, provides an excellent laboratory for high spectral resolution
techniques. We present a model of W3(OH) based on EVN observations of the
rotationally-excited 6030 and 6035 MHz OH masers taken at 0.024 km/s spectral
resolution. The 6.0 GHz masers are becoming brighter with time and show
evidence for tangential proper motions. We confirm the existence of a region of
magnetic field oriented toward the observer to the southeast and find another
such region to the northeast in W3(OH), near the champagne flow. The 6.0 GHz
masers trace the inner edge of a counterclockwise rotating torus feature.
Masers at 6030 MHz are usually a factor of a few weaker than at 6035 MHz but
trace the same material. Velocity gradients of nearby Zeeman components are
much more closely correlated than in the ground state, likely due to the
smaller spatial separation between Zeeman components. Hydroxyl maser peaks at
very long baseline interferometric resolution appear to have structure on
scales both smaller than that resolvable as well as on larger scales.
"
What are the wave equation with the Lorentz-scalar and Lorentz-vector potential interactions?,"  A new approach to the two-body problem based on the extension of the
$SL(2,C)$ group to the $Sp(4,C)$ one is developed. The wave equation with the
Lorentz-scalar and Lorentz-vector potential interactions for the system of one
spin-1/2 and one spin-0 particle with unequal masses is constructed.
"
What are the main results for the KP-I initial value problem?,"  We prove that the KP-I initial value problem is globally well-posed in the
natural energy space of the equation.
"
What are the experimental observations of the long-lived rhodium Mossbauer Effect?,"  We summarize the experimental observations of three case studies on the
long-lived rhodium Mossbauer Effect. Extraordinary observations reported in
this work manifest the open-up of photonic band gap in analogy to the
superconducting gap. Observable gravitational effect is manifested by the
superradiance of different sample orientations corresponding to the earth
gravity. These observations are of potential importance for detecting
gravitational waves and development of the two-photon gamma laser.
"
What is the nature of superconductivity in ferromagnetic states in UGe2 via Ge nuclear-quadrupole-resonance experiments?,"  We report that a novel type of superconducting order parameter has been
realized in the ferromagnetic states in UGe$_2$ via $^{73}$Ge
nuclear-quadrupole-resonance (NQR) experiments performed under pressure ($P$).
Measurements of the nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate $(1/T_1)$ have
revealed an unconventional nature of superconductivity such that the up-spin
band is gapped with line nodes, but the down-spin band remains gapless at the
Fermi level. This result is consistent with that of a ferromagnetic
spin-pairing model in which Cooper pairs are formed among ferromagnetically
polarized electrons. The present experiment has shed new light on a possible
origin of ferromagnetic superconductivity, which is mediated by ferromagnetic
spin-density fluctuations relevant to the first-order transition inside the
ferromagnetic states.
"
What are the key concepts of the Hilbert space with 3/2 Sobolev norm?,"  We gave a new very simple proof that the completion of the space of the
diffeomorphism of the circle modulo conformal maps with respect to the
Weil-Petersson Metric is a complex analytic manifold modeled on the Hilbert
space with 3/2 Sobolev norm. Our proof is based on the analogue of the Hadamard
Theorem that the exponentila map is a complex analytic map from the tanegnt
space of a point of a simply connected manifold to the manifold.
"
What is the method for perturbative calculations of anomalous dimensions and mixing matrices of leading twist conformal primary operators in conformal field theories?,"  We extend and develop a method for perturbative calculations of anomalous
dimensions and mixing matrices of leading twist conformal primary operators in
conformal field theories. Such operators lie on the unitarity bound and hence
are conserved (irreducible) in the free theory. The technique relies on the
known pattern of breaking of the irreducibility conditions in the interacting
theory. We relate the divergence of the conformal operators via the field
equations to their descendants involving an extra field and accompanied by an
extra power of the coupling constant. The ratio of the two-point functions of
descendants and of their primaries determines the anomalous dimension, allowing
us to gain an order of perturbation theory. We demonstrate the efficiency of
the formalism on the lowest-order analysis of anomalous dimensions and mixing
matrices which is required for two-loop calculations of the former. We compare
these results to another method based on anomalous conformal Ward identities
and constraints from the conformal algebra. It also permits to gain a
perturbative order in computations of mixing matrices. We show the complete
equivalence of both approaches.
"
What is the relationship between area distortion bounds and dimension distortion estimates for planar quasiconformal mappings?,"  In his celebrated paper on area distortion for quasiconformal mappings,
Astala showed optimal area distortion bounds and dimension distortion estimates
for planar quasiconformal mappings. He asked (Question 4.4) whether a finer
result held, namely absolute continuity of Hausdorff measures under
push-forward by quasiconformal mappings. This was proved in one particular case
relevant for removability questions, in joint work of Astala, Clop, Mateu,
Orobitg and the author (""Distortion of Hausdorff measures and improved
Painlev'e removability for bounded quasiregular mappings"", Duke Math J., to
appear [ACMOU]) (Theorem 1.1), the other cases remaining open. A related
question that we left open in [ACMOU] (Question 4.2) (which was asked by Astala
to the author before [ACMOU] in an equivalent form in a personal communication)
is whether BMO removability for K-quasiregular mappings and ($L^{\infty}$)
removability for K-quasiregular mappings are indeed different problems.
  In this paper we give a series of examples answering in the positive Question
4.2 in [ACMOU], at the same time proving sharpness in two different senses of
Theorem 1.1 in [ACMOU], and also giving examples that would yield sharpness in
those two different senses as well for the absolute continuity of Hausdorff
measures under push-forward by quasiconformal mappings, were it to be proved.
"
What are the conditions for a transversely non-degenerate manifold?,"  We obtain a vanishing theorem for the half-kernel of a transverse ${\rm
Spin}\sp c$ Dirac operator on a compact manifold endowed with a transversely
almost complex Riemannian foliation twisted by a sufficiently large power of a
line bundle, whose curvature vanishes along the leaves and is transversely
non-degenerate at any point of the ambient manifold.
"
What is the relationship between isobaric fragility and local structures in the bulk of a supercooled Lennard-Jones binary mixture?,"  We reveal the existence of systematic variations of isobaric fragility in
different supercooled Lennard-Jones binary mixtures by performing molecular
dynamics simulations. The connection between fragility and local structures in
the bulk is analyzed by means of a Voronoi construction. We find that clusters
of particles belonging to locally preferred structures form slow, long-lived
domains, whose spatial extension increases by decreasing temperature. As a
general rule, a more rapid growth, upon supercooling, of such domains is
associated to a more pronounced super-Arrhenius behavior, hence to a larger
fragility.
"
What is the difference between the atom in a spherical cell and the atom in a jellium of charges?,"  We present a detailed comparison of two self-consistent equation-of-state
models which differ from their electronic contribution: the atom in a spherical
cell and the atom in a jellium of charges. It is shown that both models are
well suited for the calculation of Hugoniot shock adiabats in the high pressure
range (1 Mbar-10 Gbar), and that the atom-in-a-jellium model provides a better
treatment of pressure ionization. Comparisons with experimental data are also
presented. Shell effects on shock adiabats are reviewed in the light of these
models. They lead to additional features not only in the variations of pressure
versus density, but also in the variations of shock velocity versus particle
velocity. Moreover, such effects are found to be responsible for enhancement of
the electronic specific heat.
"
What is the interplay between the Zeeman splittings and the $s$-$d$ exchange interaction in a mesoscopic ring?,"  Spin states and persistent currents are investigated theoretically in a
mesoscopic ring with an embedded magnetic ion under a uniform magnetic field
including the spin-orbit interactions. The magnetic impurity acts as a
spin-dependent $\delta$-potential for electrons and results in gaps in the
energy spectrum, consequently suppresses the oscillation of the persistent
currents. The competition between the Zeeman splittings and the $s$-$d$
exchange interaction leads to a transition of the electron ground state in the
ring. The interplay between the periodic potential induced by the Rashba and
Dresselhaus spin-orbit interactions and the $\delta$-potential induced by the
magnetic impurity leads to significant variation in the energy spectrum, charge
density distribution, and persistent currents of electrons in the ring.
"
What are the implications of the supersymmetric solutions for the Killing vector,"  We present a systematic classification of half-supersymmetric solutions of
gauged N=2, D=5 supergravity coupled to an arbitrary number of abelian vector
multiplets for which at least one of the Killing spinors generate a time-like
Killing vector.
"
What is the relationship between the magnetic order and the precession frequencies in the muon-spin relaxation of AgNiO2?,"  Zero-field muon-spin relaxation measurements of the frustrated triangular
quantum magnet AgNiO2 are consistent with a model of charge disproportionation
that has been advanced to explain the structural and magnetic properties of
this compound. Below an ordering temperature of T_N=19.9(2) K we observe six
distinct muon precession frequencies, due to the magnetic order, which can be
accounted for with a model describing the probable muon sites. The precession
frequencies show an unusual temperature evolution which is suggestive of the
separate evolution of two opposing magnetic sublattices.
"
What is the invariant and residual entanglement in the context of quantum computing?,"  In this paper, we find the invariant for $n$-qubits and propose the residual
entanglement for $n$-qubits by means of the invariant. Thus, we establish a
relation between SLOCC entanglement and the residual entanglement. The
invariant and the residual entanglement can be used for SLOCC entanglement
classification for $n$-qubits.
"
What is the asymptotics of the collision time for $n$ independent Brownian motions?,"  In this note we consider the time of the collision $\tau$ for $n$ independent
Brownian motions $X^1_t,...,X_t^n$ with drifts $a_1,...,a_n$, each starting
from $x=(x_1,...,x_n)$, where $x_1<...<x_n$. We show the exact asymptotics of
$P_x(\tau>t) = C h(x)t^{-\alpha}e^{-\gamma t}(1 + o(1))$ as $t\to\infty$ and
identify $C,h(x),\alpha,\gamma$ in terms of the drifts.
"
What are the combinatorial complexity of the Voronoi diagram of n curves in R^d with k vertices each?,"  We give lower bounds for the combinatorial complexity of the Voronoi diagram
of polygonal curves under the discrete Frechet distance. We show that the
Voronoi diagram of n curves in R^d with k vertices each, has complexity
Omega(n^{dk}) for dimension d=1,2 and Omega(n^{d(k-1)+2}) for d>2.
"
What are the microscopic origin of resistance switching in transition-metal oxides?,"  Transition-metal oxides exhibiting a bistable resistance state are attractive
for non-volatile memory applications. The relevance of oxygen vacancies (VO)
for the resistance-change memory was investigated with x-ray fluorescence,
infrared microscopy, and x-ray absorption spectroscopy using Cr-doped SrTiO3 as
example. We propose that the microscopic origin of resistance switching in this
class of materials is due to an oxygen-vacancy drift occurring in close
proximity to one of the electrodes.
"
What is the relationship between the photon energy and the maximum of the total photoionization cross section?,"  In a quasiclassical framework, we formulate the quadruple ionization by
single photon absorption of the Coulomb five-body problem. We present the
quadruple photoionization total cross section of the ground state of Beryllium
for energies up to 620 eV. Our quasiclassical results for energies close to
threshold are in agreement with the Wannier threshold law for four electron
escape. In addition, the agreement of our results with a shape formula provides
support for the overall shape of our total quadruple cross section. Finally, we
find that the photon energy where the maximum of the total photoionization
cross section occurs for single, double, triple and quadruple photoionization
of H, He, Li and Be, respectively, seems to follow a linear relation with the
threshold energy for complete break-up of the respective element.
"
What is the influence of the n-p mass difference on the abundance of primordial elements?,"  We analyze the effect of variation of fundamental couplings and mass scales
on primordial nucleosynthesis in a systematic way. The first step establishes
the response of primordial element abundances to the variation of a large
number of nuclear physics parameters, including nuclear binding energies. We
find a strong influence of the n-p mass difference (for the 4He abundance), of
the nucleon mass (for deuterium) and of A=3,4,7 binding energies (for 3He, 6Li
and 7Li). A second step relates the nuclear parameters to the parameters of the
Standard Model of particle physics. The deuterium, and, above all, 7Li
abundances depend strongly on the average light quark mass hat{m} \equiv
(m_u+m_d)/2. We calculate the behaviour of abundances when variations of
fundamental parameters obey relations arising from grand unification. We also
discuss the possibility of a substantial shift in the lithium abundance while
the deuterium and 4He abundances are only weakly affected.
"
What are the orthogonal intersection rules for generalized composite intersecting S-brane solutions?,"  A family of generalized composite intersecting S-brane solutions with
orthogonal intersection rules is described.
"
What is the intrinsic redshift (DIR) model's explanation for the evolution of AGN galaxies?,"  In the decreasing intrinsic redshift (DIR) model galaxies are assumed to be
born as compact objects that have been ejected with large intrinsic redshift
components, z_(i), out of the nuclei of mature AGN galaxies. As young AGN
(quasars) they are initially several magnitudes sub-luminous to mature galaxies
but their luminosity gradually increases over 10^8 yrs, as z_(i) decreases and
they evolve into mature AGN (Seyferts and radio galaxies). Evidence presented
here that low- and intermediate-redshift AGN are unquestionably sub-luminous to
radio galaxies is then strong support for this model and makes it likely that
the high-redshift AGN (quasars) are also sub-luminous, having simply been
pushed above the radio galaxies on a logz-m_(v) plot by the presence of a large
intrinsic component in their redshifts. An increase in luminosity below z =
0.06 is also seen. It is associated in the DIR model with an increase in
luminosity as the sources mature but, if real, is difficult to interpret in the
cosmological redshift (CR) model since at this low redshift it is unlikely to
be associated with a higher star formation rate or an increase in the material
used to build galaxies. Whether it might be possible in the CR model to explain
these results by selection effects is also examined.
"
What is the magnitude of the irreducible instrumental background in the Gamma Ray Large Area Space Telescope (GLAST)?,"  The diffuse extragalactic gamma-ray background (EGRB) has been derived by
various groups from observations by the Energetic Gamma Ray Experiment
Telescope (EGRET) instrument on the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory (CGRO). The
derived EGRB consists of gamma rays that may come from astrophysical
components, such as from unresolved extragalactic point sources (blazars,
normal galaxies, etc.), true extragalactic diffuse emission, misattributed
diffuse signals from the Galaxy and other celestial sources, and an irreducible
instrumental background due to gamma rays produced by cosmic-ray (CR)
interactions in the EGRET instrument. Using the Gamma Ray Large Area Space
Telescope (GLAST) simulation and reconstruction software, we have investigated
the magnitude of the irreducible instrumental background in the GLAST Large
Area Telescope. We re-scale our results to the EGRET and present preliminary
results of our study and its effect on current estimates of the EGRB.

"
What is the relationship between the asymptotic boundary conditions and the Myers-Perry black hole?,"  We consider stationary axisymmetric solutions of general relativity that
asymptote to five dimensional Minkowski space. It is known that this system has
a hidden SL(3,R) symmetry. We identify an SO(2,1) subgroup of this symmetry
group that preserves the asymptotic boundary conditions. We show that the
action of this subgroup on a static solution generates a one-parameter family
of stationary solutions carrying angular momentum. We conjecture that by
repeated applications of this procedure one can generate all stationary
axisymmetric solutions starting from static ones. As an example, we derive the
Myers-Perry black hole starting from the Schwarzschild solution in five
dimensions.
"
"What is the philosophy of decomposing complex objects into structured, pseudo-random, and small components?","  Combinatorics, like computer science, often has to deal with large objects of
unspecified (or unusable) structure. One powerful way to deal with such an
arbitrary object is to decompose it into more usable components. In particular,
it has proven profitable to decompose such objects into a \emph{structured}
component, a \emph{pseudo-random} component, and a \emph{small} component (i.e.
an error term); in many cases it is the structured component which then
dominates. We illustrate this philosophy in a number of model cases.
"
"What is the pressure of a two-body, mean-field spin glass a Lipschitz function of the distribution of the random coupling constants?","  We obtain bounds to show that the pressure of a two-body, mean-field spin
glass is a Lipschitz function of the underlying distribution of the random
coupling constants, with respect to a particular semi-norm. This allows us to
re-derive a result of Carmona and Hu, on the universality of the SK model, by a
different proof, and to generalize this result to the Viana-Bray model. We also
prove another bound, suitable when the coupling constants are not independent,
which is what is necessary if one wants to consider ``canonical'' instead of
``grand canonical'' versions of the SK and Viana-Bray models. Finally, we
review Viana-Bray type models, using the language of L\'evy processes, which is
natural in this context.
"
What is the TeV scale model for leptogenesis?,"  We present a TeV scale model for leptogenesis where the origin of neutrino
masses are independent of the scale of leptogenesis. As a result, the model
could be extended to explain {\it dark matter, neutrino masses and leptogenesis
at the TeV scale}. The most attractive feature of this model is that it
predicts a few hundred GeV triplet Higgs scalar that can be tested at LHC or
ILC.
"
What is the Elliott conjecture and how is it localized at the Jiang-Su algebra Z?,"  We formally introduce the concept of localizing the Elliott conjecture at a
given strongly self-absorbing C*-algebra $D$; we also explain how the known
classification theorems for nuclear C*-algebras fit into this concept. As a new
result in this direction, we employ recent results of Lin to show that (under a
mild K-theoretic condition) the class of separable, unital, simple C*-algebras
with locally finite decomposition rank and UCT, and for which projections
separate traces, satisfies the Elliott conjecture localized at the Jiang-Su
algebra Z.
  Our main result is formulated in a more general way; this allows us to
outline a strategy to possibly remove the trace space condition as well as the
K-theory restriction entirely. When regarding both our result and the recent
classification theorem of Elliott, Gong and Li as generalizations of the real
rank zero case, the two approaches are perpendicular in a certain sense. The
strategy to attack the general case aims at combining these two approaches.
  Our classification theorem covers simple ASH algebras for which projections
separate traces (and the K-groups of which have finitely generated torsion
part); it does, however, not at all depend on an inductive limit structure.
Also, in the monotracial case it does not rely on the existence or absence of
projections in any way. In fact, it is the first such result which, in a
natural way, covers all known unital, separable, simple, nuclear and stably
finite C*-algebras of real rank zero (the K-groups of which have finitely
generated torsion part) as well as the (projectionless) Jiang-Su algebra
itself.
"
What is the physical mechanism of the dissipation in mesoscopic superconductors?,"  The response of mesoscopic superconductors to an ac magnetic field is
investigated both experimentally and with numerical simulations. We study small
square samples with dimensions of the order of the penetration depth. We obtain
the ac susceptibitity $\chi=\chi'+i\chi''$ at microwave frequencies as a
function of the dc magnetic field $H_{dc}$. We find that the dissipation, given
by $\chi''$, has a non monotonous behavior in mesoscopic samples. In the
numerical simulations we obtain that the dissipation increases before the
penetration of vortices and then it decreases abruptly after vortices have
entered the sample. This is verified experimentally, where we find that
$\chi''$ has strong oscillations as a function of $H_{dc}$ in small squares of
Pb.
"
What is the significance of the coincidence of $\Omega_b - \Omega_{DM}$ in the satellite problem and the cusp problem?,"  We show that axinos, which are dominantly generated by the decay of the
next-to-lightest supersymmetric particles produced from the leptonic $Q$-ball
($L$-ball), become warm dark matter suitable for the solution of the missing
satellite problem and the cusp problem. In addition, $\Omega_b - \Omega_{DM}$
coincidence is naturally explained in this scenario.
"
What is the reason behind the Kondo-like feature in cerium adatoms?,"  In low temperature scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) experiments a cerium
adatom on Ag(100) possesses two discrete states with significantly different
apparent heights. These atomic switches also exhibit a Kondo-like feature in
spectroscopy experiments. By extensive theoretical simulations we find that
this behavior is due to diffusion of hydrogen from the surface onto the Ce
adatom in the presence of the STM tip field. The cerium adatom possesses
vibrational modes of very low energy (3-4meV) and very high efficiency (> 20%),
which are due to the large changes of Ce-states in the presence of hydrogen.
The atomic vibrations lead to a Kondo-like feature at very low bias voltages.
We predict that the same low-frequency/high-efficiency modes can also be
observed at lanthanum adatoms.
"
What are the limitations of current spectral models of the X-ray spectrum of AGN observed through an accretion disk wind?,"  (abridged) The accretion disk in AGN is expected to produce strong outflows,
in particular a UV-line driven wind. Despite providing a good fit to the data,
current spectral models of the X-ray spectrum of AGN observed through an
accretion disk wind are ad-hoc in their treatment of the properties of the wind
material. In order to address these limitations we adopt a numerical
computation method that links a series of radiative transfer calculations,
incorporating the effect of a global velocity field in a self-consistent manner
(XSCORT). We present a series of example spectra from the XSCORT code that
allow us to examine the shape of AGN X-ray spectra seen through a wind, for a
range of velocity and density distributions, total column densities and initial
ionization parameters. These detailed spectral models clearly show considerable
complexity and structure that is strongly affected by all these factors. The
presence of sharp features in the XSCORT spectra contrasts strongly with both
the previous models and with the smooth nature of the observed X-ray spectra of
AGN with soft X-ray excesses, demonstrating that accretion disk winds are
unlikely to be the origin of this mysterious spectral feature. The most
significant parameter affecting the presence of the sharp features in the
models is the terminal velocity of the wind. Increasing the terminal velocity
of the absorbing material to ~c, and hence dramatically increasing the velocity
dispersion across the wind, could potentially remove these features resulting
in a spectrum similar to the previous models. Such a fast moving outflow cannot
be associated with a radiatively driven accretion disk wind, however the
presence of a highly relativistic jet may provide an origin for such material.
"
What is the sequence of blowups of X for tame quotient singularities?,"  For a variety $X$ of positive characteristic and a non-negative integer $e$,
we define its $e$-th F-blowup to be the universal flattening of the
$e$-iterated Frobenius of $X$. Thus we have the sequence (a set labeled by
non-negative integers) of blowups of $X$. Under some condition, the sequence
stabilizes and leads to a nice (for instance, minimal or crepant) resolution.
For tame quotient singularities, the sequence leads to the $G$-Hilbert scheme.
"
"What is the main goal of the ECHO numerical code, and what features does it offer?","  We present a new numerical code, ECHO, based on an Eulerian Conservative High
Order scheme for time dependent three-dimensional general relativistic
magnetohydrodynamics (GRMHD) and magnetodynamics (GRMD). ECHO is aimed at
providing a shock-capturing conservative method able to work at an arbitrary
level of formal accuracy (for smooth flows), where the other existing GRMHD and
GRMD schemes yield an overall second order at most. Moreover, our goal is to
present a general framework, based on the 3+1 Eulerian formalism, allowing for
different sets of equations, different algorithms, and working in a generic
space-time metric, so that ECHO may be easily coupled to any solver for
Einstein's equations. Various high order reconstruction methods are implemented
and a two-wave approximate Riemann solver is used. The induction equation is
treated by adopting the Upwind Constrained Transport (UCT) procedures,
appropriate to preserve the divergence-free condition of the magnetic field in
shock-capturing methods. The limiting case of magnetodynamics (also known as
force-free degenerate electrodynamics) is implemented by simply replacing the
fluid velocity with the electromagnetic drift velocity and by neglecting the
matter contribution to the stress tensor. ECHO is particularly accurate,
efficient, versatile, and robust. It has been tested against several
astrophysical applications, including a novel test on the propagation of large
amplitude circularly polarized Alfven waves. In particular, we show that
reconstruction based on a Monotonicity Preserving filter applied to a fixed
5-point stencil gives highly accurate results for smooth solutions, both in
flat and curved metric (up to the nominal fifth order), while at the same time
providing sharp profiles in tests involving discontinuities.
"
"What are the quasi-steady shocks in cooling, where quasi-steady shocks are objects composed of truncated steady-state models of shocks at any intermediate time?","  I present time-dependent analytical solutions of quasi-steady shocks with
cooling, where quasi-steady shocks are objects composed of truncated
steady-state models of shocks at any intermediate time. I compare these
solutions to simulations with a hydrodynamical code and finally discuss
quasi-steady shocks as approximations to time-dependent shocks. Large departure
of both the adiabatic and steady-state approximations from the quasi-steady
solution emphasise the importance of the cooling history in determining the
trajectory of a shock.
"
What is the capability of the proposed NEMO km$^3$ telescope to detect TeV muon neutrinos from Galactic microquasars?,"  We present the results of Monte Carlo simulation studies of the capability of
the proposed NEMO km$^3$ telescope to detect TeV muon neutrinos from Galactic
microquasars. In particular we determined the detector sensitivity to each
known microquasar, optimizing the event selection in order to reject the
atmospheric background. We also determined the expected number of source and
background events surviving the selection.
"
What are the key factors that contribute to the improved performance of fluctuation-enhanced gas sensing?,"  We present a short survey on fluctuation-enhanced gas sensing. We compare
some of its main characteristics with those of classical sensing. We address
the problem of linear response, information channel capacity, missed alarms and
false alarms.
"
What is the relevance to the quasi-linear Stokes phenomenon for Painleve equations?,"  The nonlinear steepest descent method for rank-two systems relies on the
notion of g-function. The applicability of the method ranges from orthogonal
polynomials (and generalizations) to Painleve transcendents, and integrable
wave equations (KdV, NonLinear Schroedinger, etc.).
  For the case of asymptotics of generalized orthogonal polynomials with
respect to varying complex weights we can recast the requirements for the
Cauchy-transform of the equilibrium measure into a problem of algebraic
geometry and harmonic analysis and completely solve the existence and
uniqueness issue without relying on the minimization of a functional. This
addresses and solves also the issue of the ``free boundary problem'',
determining implicitly the curves where the zeroes of the orthogonal
polynomials accumulate in the limit of large degrees and the support of the
measure. The relevance to the quasi--linear Stokes phenomenon for Painleve
equations is indicated. A numerical algorithm to find these curves in some
cases is also explained.

"
How can the azimuthal location of each reactor be determined in a setup with a separation angle of 30 degrees?,"  In scintillator detectors, the forward displacement of the neutron in the
reaction $\bar\nu_e+p\to e^++n$ provides neutrino directional information as
demonstrated by the CHOOZ reactor experiment with 2,500 events. The near
detector of the forthcoming Double Chooz experiment will collect
$1.6\times10^5$ events per year, enough to determine the average neutrino
direction with a $1 \sigma$ half-cone aperture of $2.3^\circ$ in one year. It
is more difficult to separate the two Chooz reactors that are viewed at a
separation angle $\phi=30^\circ$. If their strengths are known and
approximately equal, the azimuthal location of each reactor is obtained with
$\pm6^\circ$ ($1 \sigma$) and the probability of confusing them with a single
source is less than 11%. Five year's data reduce this ``confusion probability''
to less than 0.3%, i.e., a $3 \sigma$ separation is possible. All of these
numbers improve rapidly with increasing angular separation of the sources. For
a setup with $\phi=90^\circ$ and one year's data, the azimuthal $1 \sigma$
uncertainty for each source decreases to $\pm3.2^\circ$. Of course, for Double
Chooz the two reactor locations are known, allowing one instead to measure
their individual one-year integrated power output to $\pm11%$ ($1 \sigma$), and
their five-year integrated output to $\pm4.8%$ ($1 \sigma$).
"
"How do the velocity fluctuations of the charge behave in the early stage of evolution, and what is the rate at which they grow?","  The influence of quantized electromagnetic fields on a nonrelativistic
charged particle moving near a conducting plate is studied. We give a
field-theoretic derivation of the nonlinear, non-Markovian Langevin equation of
the particle by the method of Feynman-Vernon influence functional. This
stochastic approach incorporates not only the stochastic noise manifested from
electromagnetic vacuum fluctuations, but also dissipation backreaction on a
charge in the form of the retarded Lorentz forces. Since the imposition of the
boundary is expected to anisotropically modify the effects of the fields on the
evolution of the particle, we consider the motion of a charge undergoing
small-amplitude oscillations in the direction either parallel or normal to the
plane boundary. Under the dipole approximation for nonrelativistic motion,
velocity fluctuations of the charge are found to grow linearly with time in the
early stage of the evolution at the rather different rate, revealing strong
anisotropic behavior. They are then asymptotically saturated as a result of the
fluctuation-dissipation relation, and the same saturated value is found for the
motion in both directions. The observational consequences are discussed. plane
boundary. Velocity fluctuations of the charge are found to grow linearly with
time in the early stage of the evolution at the rate given by the relaxation
constant, which turns out to be smaller in the parallel case than in the
perpendicular one in a similar configuration. Then, they are asymptotically
saturated as a result of the fluctuation-dissipation relation. For the
electron, the same saturated value is obtained for motion in both directions,
and is mainly determined by its oscillatory motion. Possible observational
consequences are discussed.

"What are the general expressions for the R-parity violating contributions to the mixing parameters $y$ for $D^0 -\bar D^0$ and $B^0_{d,s} - \bar B^0_{d,s}$ systems?","  We study R-parity violating contributions to the mixing parameter $y$ for
$D^0 -\bar D^0$ and $B^0_{d,s} - \bar B^0_{d,s}$ systems. We first obtain
general expressions for new physics contributions to $y$ from effective four
fermion operators. We then use them to study R-parity contributions. We find
that R-parity violating contributions to $D^0 - \bar D^0$ mixing, and $B_{d}^0
- \bar B_{d}^0$ to be small. There may be sizable contribution to $B_s^0 -\bar
B_s^0$ mixing. We also obtain some interesting bounds on R-parity violating
parameters using known Standard Model predictions and experimental data.
"
What are the implications of the anion/neutral abundance ratio for the detection of hydrocarbon anions in the interstellar medium?,"  The recent detection of the hydrocarbon anion C6H- in the interstellar medium
has led us to investigate the synthesis of hydrocarbon anions in a variety of
interstellar and circumstellar environments. We find that the anion/neutral
abundance ratio can be quite large, on the order of at least a few percent,
once the neutral has more than five carbon atoms. Detailed modeling shows that
the column densities of C6H- observed in IRC+10216 and TMC-1 can be reproduced.
Our calculations also predict that other hydrocarbon anions, such as C4H- and
C8H-, are viable candidates for detection in IRC+10216, TMC-1 and
photon-dominated regions such as the Horsehead Nebula.
"
What are the universal trends observed in relativistic nucleus-nucleus collisions at the LHC?,"  Apparently universal trends have been observed in relativistic
nucleus-nucleus collisions up to RHIC energies. Here, we review these trends
and we discuss their agnostic extrapolation to heavy ion collisions at the LHC.
"
What is the optical system described in the paper?,"  A laser-based angle resolved photoemission (APRES) system utilizing 6 eV
photons from the fourth harmonic of a mode-locked Ti:sapphire oscillator is
described. This light source greatly increases the momentum resolution and
photoelectron count rate, while reducing extrinsic background and surface
sensitivity relative to higher energy light sources. In this review, the
optical system is described, and special experimental considerations for
low-energy ARPES are discussed. The calibration of the hemispherical electron
analyzer for good low-energy angle-mode performance is also described. Finally,
data from the heavily studied high T_c superconductor Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+\delta
(Bi2212) is compared to the results from higher photon energies.
"
What are the branching ratios of some selected flavour changing neutral current processes expressed as functions of the masses of the charged leptons and the neutral Higgs bosons?,"  The mass matrices of the charged leptons and neutrinos, previously derived in
a minimal S_3-invariant extension of the Standard Model, were reparametrized in
terms of their eigenvalues. We obtained explicit, analytical expressions for
all entries in the neutrino mixing matrix, V_PMNS, the neutrino mixing angles
and the Majorana phases as functions of the masses of charged leptons and
neutrinos in excellent agreement with the latest experimental values. The
resulting V_PMNS matrix is very close to the tri-bimaximal form of the neutrino
mixing matrix. We also derived explicit analytical expressions for the matrices
of the Yukawa couplings and computed the branching ratios of some selected
flavour changing neutral current processes as functions of the masses of the
charged leptons and the neutral Higgs bosons. We find that the S_3 x Z_2
flavour symmetry and the strong mass hierarchy of the charged leptons strongly
suppress the FCNC processes in the leptonic sector well below the present
experimental upper bounds by many orders of magnitude.
"
What is the on-chip cooling protocol used for a micro-mechanical resonator?,"  Using a semi-classical approach, we describe an on-chip cooling protocol for
a micro-mechanical resonator by employing a superconducting flux qubit. A
Lorentz force, generated by the passive back-action of the resonator's
displacement, can cool down the thermal motion of the mechanical resonator by
applying an appropriate microwave drive to the qubit. We show that this onchip
cooling protocol, with well-controlled cooling power and a tunable response
time of passive back-action, can be highly efficient. With feasible
experimental parameters, the effective mode temperature of a resonator could be
cooled down by several orders of magnitude.
"
What are the nucleus independent chemical shift values in a cluster?,"  In this communication we analyze the stability, reactivity and possible
aromatic behavior of two recently reported clusters (Reveles J. U.; Khanna S.
N.; Roach P. J.; Castleman A. W. jr. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci, 2006, 103, 18405),
viz., Al7C- and Al7O- in the light of the principles of the maximum hardness
and minimum electrophilicity as well as the nucleus independent chemical shift
values.
"
What is the information-theoretic approach to watermark embedding and detection under limited detector resources?,"  An information-theoretic approach is proposed to watermark embedding and
detection under limited detector resources. First, we consider the attack-free
scenario under which asymptotically optimal decision regions in the
Neyman-Pearson sense are proposed, along with the optimal embedding rule.
Later, we explore the case of zero-mean i.i.d. Gaussian covertext distribution
with unknown variance under the attack-free scenario. For this case, we propose
a lower bound on the exponential decay rate of the false-negative probability
and prove that the optimal embedding and detecting strategy is superior to the
customary linear, additive embedding strategy in the exponential sense.
Finally, these results are extended to the case of memoryless attacks and
general worst case attacks. Optimal decision regions and embedding rules are
offered, and the worst attack channel is identified.
"
What are the conditions for fading relay channels with degraded subchannels?,"  As a basic information-theoretic model for fading relay channels, the
parallel relay channel is first studied, for which lower and upper bounds on
the capacity are derived. For the parallel relay channel with degraded
subchannels, the capacity is established, and is further demonstrated via the
Gaussian case, for which the synchronized and asynchronized capacities are
obtained. The capacity achieving power allocation at the source and relay nodes
among the subchannels is characterized. The fading relay channel is then
studied, for which resource allocations that maximize the achievable rates are
obtained for both the full-duplex and half-duplex cases. Capacities are
established for fading relay channels that satisfy certain conditions.
"
What is the impact of correlated noise on transit time-scales on the detectability of transits in stellar systems?,"  We present an extension of the formalism recently proposed by Pepper & Gaudi
to evaluate the yield of transit surveys in homogeneous stellar systems,
incorporating the impact of correlated noise on transit time-scales on the
detectability of transits, and simultaneously incorporating the magnitude
limits imposed by the need for radial velocity follow-up of transit candidates.
New expressions are derived for the different contributions to the noise budget
on transit time-scales and the least-squares detection statistic for box-shaped
transits, and their behaviour as a function of stellar mass is re-examined.
Correlated noise that is constant with apparent stellar magnitude implies a
steep decrease in detection probability at the high mass end which, when
considered jointly with the radial velocity requirements, can severely limit
the potential of otherwise promising surveys in star clusters. However, we find
that small-aperture, wide field surveys may detect hot Neptunes whose radial
velocity signal can be measured with present-day instrumentation in very nearby
(<100 pc) clusters.
"
What are the two transitions of network structure and node states?,"  We study the co-evolution of network structure and node states in a model of
multiple state interacting agents. The system displays two transitions, network
recombination and fragmentation, governed by time scales that emerge from the
dynamics. The recombination transition separates a frozen configuration,
composed by disconnected network components whose agents share the same state,
from an active configuration, with a fraction of links that are continuously
being rewired. The nature of this transition is explained analytically as the
maximum of a characteristic time. The fragmentation transition, that appears
between two absorbing frozen phases, is an anomalous order-disorder transition,
governed by a crossover between the time scales that control the structure and
state dynamics.
"
What is the effect of the parity of the loop sizes on the structure of the solution space?,"  We solve the Edwards-Anderson model (EA) in different Husimi lattices. We
show that, at T=0, the structure of the solution space depends on the parity of
the loop sizes. Husimi lattices with odd loop sizes have always a trivial
paramagnetic solution stable under 1RSB perturbations while, in Husimi lattices
with even loop sizes, this solution is absent. The range of stability under
1RSB perturbations of this and other RS solutions is computed analytically
(when possible) or numerically. We compute the free-energy, the complexity and
the ground state energy of different Husimi lattices at the level of the 1RSB
approximation. We also show, when the fraction of ferromagnetic couplings
increases, the existence, first, of a discontinuous transition from a
paramagnetic to a spin glass phase and latter of a continuous transition from a
spin glass to a ferromagnetic phase.
"
What are the implications of the existence of these proofs for any number of qubits?,"  If we distribute n qubits between two parties, which quantum pure states and
distributions of qubits would allow all-versus-nothing (or
Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger-like) proofs of Bell's theorem using only
single-qubit measurements? We show a necessary and sufficient condition for the
existence of these proofs for any number of qubits, and provide all distinct
proofs up to n=7 qubits. Remarkably, there is only one distribution of a state
of n=4 qubits, and six distributions, each for a different state of n=6 qubits,
which allow these proofs.
"
What is the low energy spectrum of the supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory on a spatial three-torus?,"  The low energy spectrum of (3+1)-dimensional N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills
theory on a spatial three-torus contains a certain number of bound states,
characterized by their discrete abelian magnetic and electric 't Hooft fluxes.
At weak coupling, the wave-functions of these states are supported near points
in the moduli space of flat connections where the unbroken gauge group is
semi-simple. The number of such states is related to the number of normalizable
bound states at threshold in the supersymmetric matrix quantum mechanics with
16 supercharges based on this unbroken group. Mathematically, the determination
of the spectrum relies on the classification of almost commuting triples with
semi-simple centralizers. We complete the work begun in a previous paper, by
computing the spectrum of bound states in theories based on the
even-dimensional spin groups and the exceptional groups. The results satisfy
the constraints of S-duality in a rather non-trivial way.
"
What are the implications of the g index for the data set of a set of articles?,"  The g index was introduced by Leo Egghe as an improvement of Hirsch's index h
for measuring the overall citation record of a set of articles. It better takes
into account the highly skewed frequency distribution of citations than the h
index. I propose to sharpen this g index by excluding the self-citations. I
have worked out nine practical cases in physics and compare the h and g values
with and without self-citations. As expected, the g index characterizes the
data set better than the h index. The influence of the self-citations appears
to be more significant for the g index than for the h index.
"
What is the accuracy of the photometric redshifts derived from the templates?,"  We built an optimal basis of low resolution templates for galaxies over the
wavelength range from 0.2 to 10 $\mu$m using a variant of the algorithm
presented by Budavari et al. (2000). We derived them using eleven bands of
photometry from the NDWFS, FLAMEX, zBo\""otes and IRAC Shallow surveys for 16033
galaxies in the NDWFS Bo\""otes field with spectroscopic redshifts measured by
the AGN and Galaxy Evolution Survey. We also developed algorithms to accurately
determine photometric redshifts, K corrections and bolometric luminosities
using these templates. Our photometric redshifts have an accuracy of
$\sigma_z/(1+z) = 0.04$ when clipped to the best 95%. We used these templates
to study the spectral type distribution in the field and to estimate luminosity
functions of galaxies as a function of redshift and spectral type. In
particular, we note that the 5-8$\mu$m color distribution of galaxies is
bimodal, much like the optical g--r colors.
"
What is the quantum grassmannian decomposition of the prime spectrum?,"  We consider quantum Schubert cells in the quantum grassmannian and give a
cell decomposition of the prime spectrum via the Schubert cells. As a
consequence, we show that all primes are completely prime in the generic case
where the deformation parameter q is not a root of unity. There is a torus H
that acts naturally on the quantum grassmannian and the cell decomposition of
the set of H-primes leads to a parameterisation of the H-spectrum via certain
diagrams on partitions associated to the Schubert cells. Interestingly, the
same parameterisation occurs for the non-negative cells in recent studies
concerning the totally non-negative grassmannian. Finally, we use the cell
decomposition to establish that the quantum grassmannian satisfies normal
separation and catenarity.
"
What is the zero bias anomaly in the tunneling density of states in a diffusive metallic film?,"  The non-equilibrium zero bias anomaly (ZBA) in the tunneling density of
states of a diffusive metallic film is studied. An effective action describing
virtual fluctuations out-of-equilibrium is derived. The singular behavior of
the equilibrium ZBA is smoothed out by real processes of inelastic scattering.
"
What is the relationship between the magnetohydrodynamic instability and the kink-like wave mode in the Earth's current sheet?,"  A new kind of magnetohydrodynamic instability and waves are analyzed for a
current sheet in the presence of a small normal magnetic field component
varying along the sheet. These waves and instability are related to existence
of two gradients of the tangential and normal magnetic field components along
the normal and tangential directions with respect to the current sheet. The
current sheet can be stable or unstable if the multiplication of two magnetic
gradients is positive or negative. In the stable region, the kink-like wave
mode is interpreted as so called flapping waves observed in the Earth's
magnetotail current sheet. The kink wave group velocity estimated for the
Earth's current sheet is of the order of a few tens kilometers per second. This
is in good agreement with the observations of the flapping motions of the
magnetotail current sheet.
"
How does the partition function of a replicated classical one-dimensional Coulomb gas relate to the state of the system?,"  We study nonperturbative interaction corrections to the thermodynamic
quantities of multichannel disordered wires in the presence of the Coulomb
interactions. Within the replica nonlinear $\sigma$-model (NL$\sigma$M)
formalism, they arise from nonperturbative soliton saddle points of the
NL$\sigma$M action. The problem is reduced to evaluating the partition function
of a replicated classical one dimensional Coulomb gas. The state of the latter
depends on two parameters: the number of transverse channels in the wire,
N_{ch}, and the dimensionless conductance, G(L_T), of a wire segment of length
equal to the thermal diffusion length, L_T. At relatively high temperatures,
$G(L_T) \gtrsim \ln N_{ch} $, the gas is dimerized, i.e. consists of bound
neutral pairs. At lower temperatures, $\ln N_{ch} \gtrsim G(L_T) \gtrsim 1$,
the pairs overlap and form a Coulomb plasma. The crossover between the two
regimes occurs at a parametrically large conductance $G(L_T) \sim \ln N_{ch}$,
and may be studied independently from the perturbative effects. Specializing to
the high temperature regime, we obtain the leading nonperturbative correction
to the wire heat capacity. Its ratio to the heat capacity for noninteracting
electrons, C_0, is $\delta C/C_0\sim N_{ch}G^2(L_T)e^{-2G(L_T)}$.
"
How do the scalar extension and braided cocommutative coalgebras relate to the comonadic (weakened) version of Schauenburg's theorem?,"  After recalling the definition of a bicoalgebroid, we define comodules and
modules over a bicoalgebroid. We construct the monoidal category of comodules,
and define Yetter--Drinfel'd modules over a bicoalgebroid. It is proved that
the Yetter--Drinfel'd category is monoidal and pre--braided just as in the case
of bialgebroids, and is embedded into the one--sided center of the comodule
category. We proceed to define Braided Cocommutative Coalgebras (BCC) over a
bicoalgebroid, and dualize the scalar extension construction of Brzezinski and
Militaru [2] and Balint and Slachanyi [1], originally applied to bialgebras and
bialgebroids, to bicoalgebroids. A few classical examples of this construction
are given. Identifying the comodule category over a bicoalgebroid with the
category of coalgebras of the associated comonad, we obtain a comonadic
(weakened) version of Schauenburg's theorem. Finally, we take a look at the
scalar extension and braided cocommutative coalgebras from a (co--)monadic
point of view.
"
What is the formula for the elements of the E(8) root system?,"  This note gives an explicit formula for the elements of the E(8) root system.
The formula is triacontagonally symmetric in that one may clearly see an action
by the cyclic group with 30 elements. The existence of such a formula is due to
the fact that the Coxeter number of E(8) is 30.
"
What are the two-body decays of Upsilon(nS) as a function of the R recoil mass?,"  Motivated by concerns regarding possible two-body contributions to the
recently-measured inclusive Upsilon(nS)->gamma+X (n=1, 2, 3) direct photon
spectra, we report on a new study of exclusive radiative decays of these narrow
Upsilon(nS) resonances into two-body final states R+gamma, with R a narrow
resonant hadronic state decaying into four or more charged particles. Such
two-body processes are not explicitly addressed in the extant theoretical
frameworks used to calculate the inclusive direct photon spectra, and must also
be explicitly inserted into Monte Carlo simulations. Using data collected from
the CLEO III detector at the Cornell Electron Storage Ring, we present upper
limits of order 0.01 per cent for such bottomonium two-body decays as a
function of the R recoil mass.
"
What is the fine structure of dark energy in the universe?,"  Following our recent work on the cosmological constant problem, in this
letter we make a specific proposal regarding the fine structure (i.e., the
spectrum) of dark energy. The proposal is motivated by a deep analogy between
the blackbody radiation problem, which led to the development of quantum
theory, and the cosmological constant problem, which we have recently argued
calls for a conceptual extension of the quantum theory. We argue that the fine
structure of dark energy is governed by a Wien distribution, indicating its
dual quantum and classical nature. We discuss a few observational consequences
of such a picture of dark energy.
"
What is the theory that accounts for anomalous properties of PuCoGa$_5$ and PuRhGa$_5$ compounds?,"  We outline key elements of a theory that accounts for anomalous properties of
the PuCoGa$_5$ and PuRhGa$_5$ compounds as a consequence of a two-body
interference between two Kondo screening channels. Virtual valence fluctuations
of the magnetic Pu configurations create two conduction channels of different
symmetry. Using the symplectic large-N approach, we are able to demonstrate our
pairing mechanism in an exactly solvable large-N limit. The critical
temperature reaches its maximum when the energy levels of excited valence
configurations are almost degenerate. The symmetry of the order parameter is
determined by the product of the Wannier form factors in the interfering
conduction channels.
"
What are the restrictions on the coefficients of the differential equation implied by analyticity?,"  A general theory of vector-valued modular functions, holomorphic in the upper
half-plane, is presented for finite dimensional representations of the modular
group. This also provides a description of vector-valued modular forms of
arbitrary half-integer weight. It is shown that the space of these modular
functions is spanned, as a module over the polynomials in J, by the columns of
a matrix that satisfies an abstract hypergeometric equation, providing a simple
solution of the Riemann-Hilbert problem for representations of the modular
group. Restrictions on the coefficients of this differential equation implied
by analyticity are discussed, and an inversion formula is presented that allows
the determination of an arbitrary vector-valued modular function from its
singular behavior. Questions of rationality and positivity of expansion
coefficients are addressed. Closed expressions for the number of vector-valued
modular forms of half-integer weight are given, and the general theory is
illustrated on simple examples.
"
What are the key concepts in a resistor network model for analyzing the scaling dependencies of the conductance in doped and disordered graphene?,"  Transport in undoped graphene is related to percolating current patterns in
the networks of {\em N-} and {\em P}-type regions reflecting the strong bipolar
charge density fluctuations. Transmissions of the {\em P-N} junctions, though
small, are vital in establishing the macroscopic conductivity. We propose a
random resistor network model to analyze scaling dependencies of the
conductance on the doping and disorder, the quantum magnetoresistance and the
corresponding dephasing rate.
"
What is the origin of the spin-flips in the proposed model for magnetic noise?,"  We propose a model for magnetic noise based on spin-flips (not
electron-trapping) of paramagnetic dangling-bonds at the
amorphous-semiconductor/oxide interface. A wide distribution of spin-flip times
is derived from the single-phonon cross-relaxation mechanism for a
dangling-bond interacting with the tunneling two-level systems of the amorphous
interface. The temperature and frequency dependence is sensitive to three
energy scales: The dangling-bond spin Zeeman energy delta, as well as the
minimum (E_min) and maximum (E_max) values for the energy splittings of the
tunneling two-level systems. We compare and fit our model parameters to a
recent experiment probing spin coherence of antimony donors implanted in
nuclear-spin-free silicon [T. Schenkel {\it et al.}, Appl. Phys. Lett. 88,
112101 (2006)], and conclude that a dangling-bond area density of the order of
10^{14}cm^{-2} is consistent with the data. This enables the prediction of
single spin qubit coherence times as a function of the distance from the
interface and the dangling-bond area density in a real device structure. We
apply our theory to calculations of magnetic flux noise affecting SQUID devices
due to their Si/SiO_2 substrate. Our explicit estimates of flux noise in SQUIDs
lead to a noise spectral density of the order of 10^{-12}Phi_{0}^{2} {Hz}^{-1}
at f=1Hz. This value might explain the origin of flux noise in some SQUID
devices. Finally, we consider the suppression of these effects using surface
passivation with hydrogen, and the residual nuclear-spin noise resulting from a
perfect silicon-hydride surface.
"
What is the observed X-ray emission in HLIRGs compared to the expected emission from a standard local QSO of the same IR luminosity?,"  Hyper-Luminous Infrared Galaxies (HLIRGs) are the most luminous persistent
objects in the Universe. They exhibit extremely high star formation rates, and
most of them seem to harbour an AGN. They are unique laboratories to
investigate utmost star formation, and its connection to super-massive black
hole growth. X-ray studies of HLIRGs have the potential to unravel the AGN
contribution to the bolometric output from these bright objects.
  We have selected a sample of 14 HLIRGs observed by XMM-Newton (type 1, type 2
AGN and starburst), 5 of which are candidates to be Compton-thick objects. This
is the first time that a systematic study of this type of objects is carried
out in the X-ray spectral band. Their X-ray spectral properties have been
correlated with their IR luminosities, estimated by IRAS, ISO and sub-mm data.
  The X-ray spectra of HLIRGs present heterogeneous properties. All our X-ray
detected HLIRGs (10) have AGN-dominated X-ray spectra. The hard X-ray
luminosity of 8 of them is consistent with a pure AGN contribution, while in
the remaining 2 sources both an AGN and a starburst seem to contribute to the
overall emission. We found soft excess emission in 5 sources. In one of them it
is consistent with a pure starburst origin, while in the other 4 sources it is
consistent with an AGN origin. The observed X-ray emission is systematically
below the one expected for a standard local QSO of the same IR luminosity,
suggesting the possible presence of absorption in type 2 objects and/or a
departure from a standard spectral energy distribution of QSO. The
X-ray-to-IR-luminosity ratio is constant with redshift, indicating similar
evolutions for the AGN and starburst component, and that their respective power
sources could be physically related.
"
What are the transport coefficients in the system not involving the Landau quasiparticles?,"  With the organic compound $\kappa$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$-Cu$_2$(CN)$_3$ in mind, we
consider a spin liquid system where a spinon Fermi surface is coupled to a U(1)
gauge field. Using the non-equilibrium Green's function formalism, we derive
the Quantum Boltzmann Equation (QBE) for this system. In this system, however,
one cannot a priori assume the existence of Landau quasiparticles. We show that
even without this assumption one can still derive a linearized equation for a
generalized distribution function. We show that the divergence of the effective
mass and of the finite temperature self-energy do not enter these transport
coefficients and thus they are well-defined. Moreover, using a variational
method, we calculate the temperature dependence of the spin resistivity and
thermal conductivity of this system.
"
What is the dependence of the inelastic scattering rate on the spin polarization of the electron system?,"  The energy relaxation in the spin-polarized disordered electron systems is
studied in the diffusive regime. We derived the quantum kinetic equation in
which the kernel of electron-electron collision integral explicitly depends on
the electron magnetization. As the consequence, the inelastic scattering rate
is found to have non-monotonic dependence on the spin polarization of the
electron system.
"
What is the relationship between field strength and X-ray luminosity in T Tauri stars?,"  We report new magnetic field measurements for 14 classical T Tauri stars
(CTTSs). We combine these data with one previous field determination in order
to compare our observed field strengths with the field strengths predicted by
magnetospheric accretion models. We use literature data on the stellar mass,
radius, rotation period, and disk accretion rate to predict the field strength
that should be present on each of our stars according to these magnetospheric
accretion models. We show that our measured field values do not correlate with
the field strengths predicted by simple magnetospheric accretion theory. We
also use our field strength measurements and literature X-ray luminosity data
to test a recent relationship expressing X-ray luminosity as a function of
surface magnetic flux derived from various solar feature and main sequence star
measurements. We find that the T Tauri stars we have observed have weaker than
expected X-ray emission by over an order of magnitude on average using this
relationship. We suggest the cause for this is actually a result of the very
strong fields on these stars which decreases the efficiency with which gas
motions in the photosphere can tangle magnetic flux tubes in the corona.
"
How is the diagnostic tool to isolate the predicted signature of the core constructed from the oscillation frequencies?,"  We present an analytical study of the effect of small convective cores on the
oscillations of solar-like pulsators. Based on an asymptotic analysis of the
wave equation near the center of the star, we derive an expression for the
perturbations to the frequencies of radial modes generated by a convective core
and discuss how these perturbations depend on the properties of the core.
Moreover, we propose a diagnostic tool to isolate the predicted signature of
the core, constructed from a particular combination of the oscillation
frequencies, and we validate this tool with simulated data. We also show that
the proposed tool can be applied to the pulsation data soon expected from
satellite missions such as CoRoT and Kepler to constrain the amplitude of the
discontinuity in the sound speed at the edge of the convective core, the ratio
between the sound speed and the radius at this same location, and the stellar
age.
"
What are the advantages of the method presented for solving the problem?,"  A method is given for solving an optimal H2 approximation problem for SISO
linear time-invariant stable systems. The method, based on constructive
algebra, guarantees that the global optimum is found; it does not involve any
gradient-based search, and hence avoids the usual problems of local minima. We
examine mostly the case when the model order is reduced by one, and when the
original system has distinct poles. This case exhibits special structure which
allows us to provide a complete solution. The problem is converted into linear
algebra by exhibiting a finite-dimensional basis for a certain space, and can
then be solved by eigenvalue calculations, following the methods developed by
Stetter and Moeller. The use of Buchberger's algorithm is avoided by writing
the first-order optimality conditions in a special form, from which a Groebner
basis is immediately available. Compared with our previous work the method
presented here has much smaller time and memory requirements, and can therefore
be applied to systems of significantly higher McMillan degree. In addition,
some hypotheses which were required in the previous work have been removed.
Some examples are included.
"
What is the OPTOTEACH system for photonics lab work?,"  This paper introduces ""OPTOTEACH"", a new teaching system for photonics lab
work, designed by Harz University and successfully released on the German
market by HarzOptics. OPTOTEACH is the first POF-WDM teaching system,
specifically designed to cover a multitude of lab experiments in the field of
optical communication technology.
  It is illustrated, how this lab system is supplemented by a newly developed
optical teaching software - ""OPTOSOFT"" - and how the combination of system and
software creates a unique augmented learning environment. The paper details,
how the didactic concept for the software was conceptualised and introduces the
latest beta version. OPTOSOFT is specifically designed not only as an
attachment to OPTOTEACH, it also allows students to rehearse various aspects of
theoretical optics and experience a fully interactive and feature-rich
self-learning environment.
  The paper further details the first experiences educators at Harz University
have made working with the lab system as well as the teaching software. So far,
the augmented learning concept was received mostly positive, although there is
some potential for further optimisation concerning integration and pacing of
various interactive modules.
"
How does turbulent diffusion influence the physical conditions and molecular content in the CNM and WNM?,"  Aims. We probe the effect of turbulent diffusion on the chemistry at the
interface between a cold neutral medium (CNM) cloudlet and the warm neutral
medium (WNM). Methods. We perform moving grid, multifluid, 1D, hydrodynamical
simulations with chemistry including thermal and chemical diffusion. The
diffusion coefficients are enhanced to account for turbulent diffusion. We
post-process the steady-states of our simulations with a crude model of
radiative transfer to compute line profiles. Results. Turbulent diffusion
spreads out the transition region between the CNM and the WNM. We find that the
CNM slightly expands and heats up: its CH and H$_2$ content decreases due to
the lower density. The change of physical conditions and diffusive transport
increase the H$^+$ content in the CNM which results in increased OH and H$_2$O.
Diffusion transports some CO out of the CNM. It also brings H$_2$ into contact
with the warm gas with enhanced production of CH$^+$, H$_3^+$, OH and H$_2$O at
the interface. O lines are sensitive to the spread of the thermal profile in
the intermediate region between the CNM and the WNM. Enhanced molecular content
at the interface of the cloud broadens the molecular line profiles and helps
exciting transitions of intermediate energy. The relative molecular yield are
found higher for bigger clouds. Conclusions. Turbulent diffusion can be the
source of additional molecular production and should be included in chemical
models of the interstellar medium (ISM). It also is a good candidate for the
interpretation of observational problems such as warm H$_2$, CH$^+$ formation
and presence of H$_3^+$.
"
What are the dynamic phases in terms of spreading rate of cell area observed in macroscopic scales?,"  Cell spreading is investigated at various scales in order to understand
motility of living cells which is essential for a range of physiological
activities in higher organisms as well as in microbes. At a microscopic scale,
it has been seen that actin polymerization at the leading edge of cell membrane
primarily helps the cell to spread depending upon its extra-cellular
environment which influences the polymerization process via some receptors on
the cell membrane. There are some interesting experimental results at
macroscopic scales (cell size) where people have observed various dynamic
phases in terms of spreading rate of cell area adhering to the substrate. In
the present paper we develop a very simple phenomenological model to capture
these dynamic apparent phases of a spreading cell without going into the

"How do the IR properties of high-redshift galaxies change with their 24 micron flux density, X-ray activity, and rest-frame near-IR color?","  We study the infrared (IR) properties of high-redshift galaxies using deep
Spitzer 24, 70, and 160 micron data. Our primary interest is to improve the
constraints on the total IR luminosities, L(IR), of these galaxies. We combine
the Spitzer data in the southern Extended Chandra Deep Field with a
K-band-selected galaxy sample and photometric redshifts from the
Multiwavelength Survey by Yale-Chile. We used a stacking analysis to measure
the average 70 and 160 micron flux densities of 1.5 < z < 2.5 galaxies as a
function of 24 micron flux density, X-ray activity, and rest-frame near-IR
color. Galaxies with 1.5 < z < 2.5 and S(24)=53-250 micro-Jy have L(IR) derived
from their average 24-160 micron flux densities within factors of 2-3 of those
derived from the 24 micron flux densities only. However, L(IR) derived from the
average 24-160 micron flux densities for galaxies with S(24) > 250 micro-Jy and
1.5 < z < 2.5 are lower than those derived using only the 24 micron flux
density by factors of 2-10. Galaxies with S(24) > 250 micro-Jy have S(70)/S(24)
flux ratios comparable to sources with X-ray detections or red rest-frame IR
colors, suggesting that warm dust possibly heated by AGN may contribute to the
high 24 micron emission. Based on the average 24-160 micron flux densities,
nearly all 24 micron-selected galaxies at 1.5 < z < 2.5 have L(IR) < 6 x 10^12
solar luminosities, which if attributed to star formation corresponds to < 1000
solar masses per year. This suggests that high redshift galaxies may have
similar star formation efficiencies and feedback processes as local analogs.
Objects with L(IR) > 6 x 10^12 solar luminosities are quite rare, with a
surface density ~ 30 +/- 10 per sq. deg, corresponding to ~ 2 +/- 1 x 10^-6
Mpc^-3 over 1.5 < z < 2.5.
"
"What are the rotational periods and phase functions of several large Kuiper Belt objects, including the dwarf planet Eris?","  (Abridged) I report new light curves and determine the rotations and phase
functions of several large Kuiper Belt objects, including the dwarf planet Eris
(2003 UB313). (120348) 2004 TY364 shows a light curve which if double-peaked
has a period of 11.70+-0.01 hours and peak-to-peak amplitude of 0.22+-0.02
magnitudes. (84922) 2003 VS2 has a well defined double-peaked light curve of
7.41+-0.02 hours with a 0.21+-0.02 magnitude range. (126154) 2001 YH140 shows
variability of 0.21+-0.04 magnitudes with a possible 13.25+-0.2 hour
single-peaked period. The seven new KBOs in the sample which show no
discernible variations within the uncertainties on short rotational time scales
are 2001 UQ18, (55565) 2002 AW197, (119979) 2002 WC19, (120132) 2003 FY128,
(136108) Eris 2003 UB313, (90482) Orcus 2004 DW, and (90568) 2004 GV9. The
three medium to large sized Kuiper Belt objects 2004 TY364, Orcus and 2004 GV9
show fairly steep linear phase curves (~0.18 to 0.26 mags per degree) between
phase angles of 0.1 and 1.5 degrees. The extremely large dwarf planet Eris
(2003 UB313) shows a shallower phase curve (0.09+-0.03 mags per degree) which
is more similar to the other known dwarf planet Pluto. It appears the surface
properties of the largest dwarf planets in the Kuiper Belt maybe different than
the smaller Kuiper Belt objects. This may have to do with the larger objects
ability to hold more volatile ices as well as sustain atmospheres. The absolute
magnitudes obtained using the measured phase slopes are a few tenths of
magnitudes different from those given by the MPC.
"
What are the results of single crystal structure analysis using synchrotron radiation?,"  The spatial charge arrangement of a typical quasi-two-dimensional organic
conductor alpha-(BEDT-TTF)2I3 is revealed by single crystal structure analysis
using synchrotron radiation. The results show that the horizontal stripe type
structure, which was suggested by mean field theory, is established. We also
find the charge disproportion above the metal-insulator transition temperature
and a significant change in transfer integrals caused by the phase transition.
Our result elucidates the insulating phase of this material as a 2k_F charge
density localization.
"
What are the main consequences of the Dirac operator in relativistic quantum mechanics?,"  This review is devoted to the study of stationary solutions of linear and
nonlinear equations from relativistic quantum mechanics, involving the Dirac
operator. The solutions are found as critical points of an energy functional.
Contrary to the Laplacian appearing in the equations of nonrelativistic quantum
mechanics, the Dirac operator has a negative continuous spectrum which is not
bounded from below. This has two main consequences. First, the energy
functional is strongly indefinite. Second, the Euler-Lagrange equations are
linear or nonlinear eigenvalue problems with eigenvalues lying in a spectral
gap (between the negative and positive continuous spectra). Moreover, since we
work in the space domain R^3, the Palais-Smale condition is not satisfied. For
these reasons, the problems discussed in this review pose a challenge in the
Calculus of Variations. The existence proofs involve sophisticated tools from
nonlinear analysis and have required new variational methods which are now
applied to other problems.
"
What is the energy surface of states localized at zigzag edges of bilayer graphene?,"  We report the existence of zero energy surface states localized at zigzag
edges of bilayer graphene. Working within the tight-binding approximation we
derive the analytic solution for the wavefunctions of these peculiar surface
states. It is shown that zero energy edge states in bilayer graphene can be
divided into two families: (i) states living only on a single plane, equivalent
to surface states in monolayer graphene; (ii) states with finite amplitude over
the two layers, with an enhanced penetration into the bulk. The bulk and
surface (edge) electronic structure of bilayer graphene nanoribbons is also
studied, both in the absence and in the presence of a bias voltage between
planes.
"
What is the relationship between neural networks and ordinal regression?,"  Ordinal regression is an important type of learning, which has properties of
both classification and regression. Here we describe a simple and effective
approach to adapt a traditional neural network to learn ordinal categories. Our
approach is a generalization of the perceptron method for ordinal regression.
On several benchmark datasets, our method (NNRank) outperforms a neural network
classification method. Compared with the ordinal regression methods using
Gaussian processes and support vector machines, NNRank achieves comparable
performance. Moreover, NNRank has the advantages of traditional neural
networks: learning in both online and batch modes, handling very large training
datasets, and making rapid predictions. These features make NNRank a useful and
complementary tool for large-scale data processing tasks such as information
retrieval, web page ranking, collaborative filtering, and protein ranking in
Bioinformatics.
"
What are the initial data of the solution of the Cauchy problem?,"  We argue that the critical behaviour near the point of ``gradient
catastrophe"" of the solution to the Cauchy problem for the focusing nonlinear
Schr\""odinger equation $ i\epsilon \psi_t +\frac{\epsilon^2}2\psi_{xx}+
|\psi|^2 \psi =0$ with analytic initial data of the form $\psi(x,0;\epsilon)
=A(x) e^{\frac{i}{\epsilon} S(x)}$ is approximately described by a particular
solution to the Painlev\'e-I equation.
"
What is the metallicity of the intracluster medium of the Suzaku observation of the link region between the galaxy clusters A399 and A401?,"  We present an analysis of a Suzaku observation of the link region between the
galaxy clusters A399 and A401. We obtained the metallicity of the intracluster
medium (ICM) up to the cluster virial radii for the first time. We determine
the metallicity where the virial radii of the two clusters cross each other (~2
Mpc away from their centers) and found that it is comparable to that in their
inner regions (~0.2 Zsun). It is unlikely that the uniformity of metallicity up
to the virial radii is due to mixing caused by a cluster collision. Since the
ram-pressure is too small to strip the interstellar medium of galaxies around
the virial radius of a cluster, the fairly high metallicity that we found there
indicates that the metals in the ICM are not transported from member galaxies
by ram-pressure stripping. Instead, the uniformity suggests that the
proto-cluster region was extensively polluted with metals by extremely powerful
outflows (superwinds) from galaxies before the clusters formed. We also
searched for the oxygen emission from the warm--hot intergalactic medium in
that region and obtained a strict upper limit of the hydrogen density
(nH<4.1x10^-5 cm^-3).
"
What is the soliton metric in a nonholonomic frame and its relation to the Riemann tensor?,"  Assuming the stability of soliton surfaces of vanishing Ricci sectional
curvature of soliton metric in the nonholonomic frame, we find a solution for
the metric in the approximation of weak constant torsion curves with constant
Frenet curvature. The computation of the Riemann tensor of the soliton metric
shows that it does not vanish and therefore the solution is nontrivial.
Heisenberg solitonic equation is also used to constrain the the soliton Riemann
metric. The new feature here is that the coordinate curves on the soliton-like
surface are composed of hydrodynamical filaments.
"
What is the relation between the peculiar velocity and density contrast predicted by the improved spherical collapse model?,"  We derive a semi-analytical extension of the spherical collapse model of
structure formation that takes account of the effects of deviations from
spherical symmetry and shell crossing which are important in the non-linear
regime. Our model is designed so that it predicts a relation between the
peculiar velocity and density contrast that agrees with the results of N-body
simulations in the region where such a comparison can sensibly be made. Prior
to turnaround, when the unmodified spherical collapse model is expect to be a
good approximation, the predictions of the two models coincide almost exactly.
The effects of a late time dominating dark energy component are also taken into
account. The improved spherical collapse model is a useful tool when one
requires a good approximation not just to the evolution of the density contrast
but also its trajectory. Moreover, the analytical fitting formulae presented is
simple enough to be used anywhere where the standard spherical collapse might
be used but with the advantage that it includes a realistic model of the
effects of virialisation.
"
"What is the Deligne-Lusztig variety, and what is the affineness criterion for DL-varieties?","  We prove that the Drinfeld halfspace is essentially the only Deligne-Lusztig
variety which is at the same time a period domain over a finite field. This is
done by comparing a cohomology vanishing theorem for DL-varieties, due to
Digne, Michel, and Rouquier, with a non-vanishing theorem for PD, due to the
first author. We also discuss an affineness criterion for DL-varieties.
"
What are the security concerns associated with detector dead times in QKD systems?,"  Recent advances in quantum key distribution (QKD) have given rise to systems
that operate at transmission periods significantly shorter than the dead times
of their component single-photon detectors. As systems continue to increase in
transmission rate, security concerns associated with detector dead times can
limit the production rate of sifted bits. We present a model of high-speed QKD
in this limit that identifies an optimum transmission rate for a system with
given link loss and detector response characteristics.
"
What are the drift vectors of interacting Brownian motions characterized by the relative ranks of the coordinate processes?,"  We study interacting systems of linear Brownian motions whose drift vector at
every time point is determined by the relative ranks of the coordinate
processes at that time. Our main objective has been to study the long range
behavior of the spacings between the Brownian motions arranged in increasing
order. For finitely many Brownian motions interacting in this manner, we
characterize drifts for which the family of laws of the vector of spacings is
tight, and show its convergence to a unique stationary joint distribution given
by independent exponential distributions with varying means. We also study one
particular countably infinite system, where only the minimum Brownian particle
gets a constant upward drift, and prove that independent and identically
distributed exponential spacings remain stationary under the dynamics of such a
process. Some related conjectures in this direction have also been discussed.
"
What is the relationship between the momentum dependence of the transition operators and the two-pion exchange diagrams in the Weinberg counting scheme?,"  Our previous study of the near-threshold pp\to pp\pi^0 reaction based on a
hybrid nuclear effective field theory is further elaborated by examining the
momentum dependence of the relevant transition operators. We show that the
two-pion exchange diagrams give much larger contributions than the one-pion
exchange diagram, even though the former is of higher order in the Weinberg
counting scheme. The relation between our results and an alternative counting
scheme, the momentum counting scheme, is also discussed.
"
"How do the saddle-points of the integrand contribute to the integral, leading to the optical precursors?","  We study theoretically the propagation of a step-modulated optical field as
it passes through a dispersive dielectric made up of a dilute collection of
oscillators characterized by a single narrow-band resonance. The propagated
field is given in terms of an integral of a Fourier type, which cannot be
evaluated even for simple models of the dispersive dielectric. The fact that
the oscillators have a low number density (dilute medium) and have a
narrow-band resonance allows us to simplify the integrand. In this case, the
integral can be evaluated exactly, although it is not possible using this
method to separate out the transient part of the propagated field known as
optical precursors. We also use an asymptotic method (saddle-point method) to
evaluate the integral. The contributions to the integral related to the
saddle-points of the integrand give rise to the optical precursors. We obtain
analytic expressions for the precursor fields and the domain over which the
asymptotic method is valid. When combined to obtain the total transient field,
we find that the agreement between the solutions obtained by the asymptotic and
the exact methods is excellent. Our results demonstrate that precursors can
persist for many nanoseconds and the chirp in the instantaneous frequency of
the precursors can manifest itself in beats in the transmitted intensity. Our
work strongly suggests that precursors have been observed in many previous
experiments.
"
What are the implications of the Myers-Perry black hole for the asymptotic boundary conditions?,"  We consider stationary axisymmetric solutions of general relativity that
asymptote to five dimensional Minkowski space. It is known that this system has
a hidden SL(3,R) symmetry. We identify an SO(2,1) subgroup of this symmetry
group that preserves the asymptotic boundary conditions. We show that the
action of this subgroup on a static solution generates a one-parameter family
of stationary solutions carrying angular momentum. We conjecture that by
repeated applications of this procedure one can generate all stationary
axisymmetric solutions starting from static ones. As an example, we derive the
Myers-Perry black hole starting from the Schwarzschild solution in five
dimensions.
"
What are the main challenges in the development of inflationary cosmology?,"  I give a general review of the history of inflationary cosmology and of its
present status.
"
"What is the photometric technique used to identify young, early-type galaxy candidates?","  We have developed an efficient photometric technique for identifying young
early-type galaxy candidates using a combination of photometric redshifts,
spectral-type classification, and optical/near-infrared colors. Applying our
technique to the GOODS HST/ACS and VLT/ISAAC data we have selected a complete
and homogeneous sample of young elliptical candidates among early-type field
galaxies. The distribution of structural parameters for these candidates shows
that their selection, which is based on early spectral types, is fully
consistent with early morphological types. We investigate the evolution of
their luminosities and colors as a function of redshift and galaxy mass and
find evidence for an increasing starburst mass fraction in these young
early-type galaxy candidates at higher redshifts, which we interpret in terms
of massive field galaxies experiencing more massive/intense starbursts at
higher redshifts. Moreover, we find indications for a systematically larger
young elliptical fraction among sub-L*/2 early-type galaxies compared to their
brighter counterparts. The total fraction among the field early-type galaxies
increases with redshift, irrespective of galaxy luminosity. Our results are
most consistent with galaxy formation scenarios in which stars in massive
early-type field galaxies are assembled earlier than in their low-mass
counterparts.
"
What is the theory of innovation and progress in human society?,"  A general theory of innovation and progress in human society is outlined,
based on the combat between two opposite forces (conservatism/inertia and
speculative herding ""bubble"" behavior). We contend that human affairs are
characterized by ubiquitous ``bubbles'', which involve huge risks which would
not otherwise be taken using standard cost/benefit analysis. Bubbles result
from self-reinforcing positive feedbacks. This leads to explore uncharted
territories and niches whose rare successes lead to extraordinary discoveries
and provide the base for the observed accelerating development of technology
and of the economy. But the returns are very heterogeneous, very risky and may
not occur. In other words, bubbles, which are characteristic definitions of
human activity, allow huge risks to get huge returns over large scales. We
outline some underlying mathematical structure and a few results involving
positive feedbacks, emergence, heavy-tailed power laws, outliers/kings/black
swans, the problem of predictability and the illusion of control, as well as
some policy implications.
"
What is the relationship between the gravitational radiation of binary systems and the geodesics in Kerr space-time?,"  Gravitational radiation of binary systems can be studied by using the
adiabatic approximation in General Relativity. In this approach a small
astrophysical object follows a trajectory consisting of a chained series of
bounded geodesics (orbits) in the outer region of a Kerr Black Hole,
representing the space time created by a bigger object. In our paper we study
the entire class of orbits, both of constant radius (spherical orbits), as well
as non-null eccentricity orbits, showing a number of properties on the physical
parameters and trajectories. The main result is the determination of the
geometrical locus of all the orbits in the space of physical parameters in Kerr
space-time. This becomes a powerful tool to know if different orbits can be
connected by a continuous change of their physical parameters. A discussion on
the influence of different values of the angular momentum of the hole is given.
Main results have been obtained by analytical methods.
"
What are the implications of the Higgs mechanism for the electroweak theory?,"  Electroweak theory joins electromagnetism with the weak force in a single
quantum field theory, ascribing the two fundamental interactions--so different
in their manifestations--to a common symmetry principle. How the electroweak
gauge symmetry is hidden is one of the most urgent and challenging questions
facing particle physics. The provisional answer incorporated in the ""standard
model"" of particle physics was formulated in the 1960s by Higgs, by Brout &
Englert, and by Guralnik, Hagen & Kibble: The agent of electroweak symmetry
breaking is an elementary scalar field whose self-interactions select a vacuum
state in which the full electroweak symmetry is hidden, leaving a residual
phase symmetry of electromagnetism. By analogy with the Meissner effect of the
superconducting phase transition, the Higgs mechanism, as it is commonly known,
confers masses on the weak force carriers W and Z. It also opens the door to
masses for the quarks and leptons, and shapes the world around us. It is a good
story--though an incomplete story--and we do not know how much of the story is
true. Experiments that explore the Fermi scale (the energy regime around 1 TeV)
during the next decade will put the electroweak theory to decisive test, and
may uncover new elements needed to construct a more satisfying completion of
the electroweak theory. The aim of this article is to set the stage by
reporting what we know and what we need to know, and to set some ""Big
Questions"" that will guide our explorations.
"
What are the necessary and sufficient conditions for a group of autonomous agents with time-varying coupling delays to reach a consensus?,"  In this paper, we consider a leader-following consensus problem of a group of
autonomous agents with time-varying coupling delays. Two different cases of
coupling topologies are investigated. At first, a necessary and sufficient
condition is proved in the case when the interconnection topology is fixed and
directed. Then a sufficient condition is proposed in the case when the coupling
topology is switched and balanced. Numerical examples are also given to
illustrate our results.

What is the process of expert elicitation used to improve the design of a complex system?,"  Comment: Expert Elicitation for Reliable System Design [arXiv:0708.0279]
"
What is the Curci-Ferrari condition for an Abelian antisymmetric gauge field?,"  We discuss BRST and anti--BRST transformations for an Abelian antisymmetric
gauge field in 4D and find that, in order for them to anticommute, we have to
impose a condition on the auxiliary fields. This condition is similar to the
Curci-Ferrari condition for the 4D non--Abelian 1-form gauge theories and
represents a consistency requirement. We interpret it as a signal that our
Abelian 2-form gauge field theory is based on gerbes. To support this
interpretation we discuss, in particular, the case of the 1-gerbe for our
present field theory and write the relevant equations and symmetry
transformations for 2-gerbes.
"
What is the absolute proper-motion of the H2O maser source in the NGC 281 West molecular cloud?,"  We report on absolute proper-motion measurements of an H2O maser source in
the NGC 281 West molecular cloud, which is located ~320 pc above the Galactic
plane and is associated with an HI loop extending from the Galactic plane. We
have conducted multi-epoch phase-referencing observations of the maser source
with VERA (VLBI Exploration of Radio Astrometry) over a monitoring period of 6
months since May 2006. We find that the H2O maser features in NGC 281 West are
systematically moving toward the southwest and further away from the Galactic
plane with a vertical velocity of ~20-30 km/s at its estimated distance of
2.2-3.5 kpc. Our new results provide the most direct evidence that the gas in
the NGC 281 region on the HI loop was blown out from the Galactic plane, most
likely in a superbubble driven by multiple or sequential supernova explosions
in the Galactic plane.
"
What is the relationship between the magnetic field and the optical spiral arms in the Scd galaxy M33?,"  We study the exponential scale length of total radio emission, the spectral
index distribution, and the linear radio polarization in the Scd galaxy M33.
Observations were carried out using the 3.6 cm dual channel and the 6.2 cm four
channel receivers of the 100--m Effelsberg telescope along with the L-band VLA
D--array at 20 cm. High spatial resolution and sensitivity in both total and
linearly polarized radio continuum emission from M33 were achieved. We found
considerable extended emission, not only from the main arms I S and I N, but
also from the weaker arms. The large--scale magnetic field exhibits
well--ordered spiral structure with almost the same orientation as that of the
optical spiral arms, however, it does not show a clear structural correlation
or anti--correlation with the optical arms. There is a north-south asymmetry in
polarization that is frequency-dependent. We found that the ring mean spectral
index versus radius increases faster beyond $R$ = 4 kpc. At each wavelength,
the exponential scale length is larger inside than outside $R$ = 4 kpc. From
the larger scales lengths at $R$ $<$ 4 kpc, we conclude that star forming
regions are mainly spread over the region $R$ $<$ 4 kpc without a dominant
nuclear concentration. Furthermore, at $R$ $<$ 4 kpc, a spatial correlation
between cosmic rays and star forming regions may exist. From the behaviour of
the mean spectral indices obtained from different pairs of the radio continuum
data at 3.6, 6.2, and 20 cm, we confirm that a decrease in the thermal fraction
causes an increase in the spectral index. The frequency-dependent asymmetry in
the polarization hints to an asymmetry in Faraday depolarization.
"
How can the sensitivity of neutron scattering at nuclei in the sub-nanometer range be improved?,"  We present preliminary results on sensitivity of experiments with slow
neutrons to constrain additional forces in a wide distance range: from
picometers to micrometers. In the sub-nanometer range, available data on
lengths of neutron scattering at nuclei provide the most competitive
constraint. We show that it can be improved significantly in a dedicated
measurement of asymmetry of neutron scattering at noble gases. In the
micrometer range, we present sensitivity of the future GRANIT experiment.
Further analysis will be presented in following publications.
"
How is the precision of laboratory precision laser spectroscopy improved by the use of optical frequency combs?,"  Typical astronomical spectrographs have a resolution ranging between a few
hundred to 200.000. Deconvolution and correlation techniques are being employed
with a significance down to 1/1000 th of a pixel. HeAr and ThAr lamps are
usually used for calibration in low and high resolution spectroscopy,
respectively. Unfortunately, the emitted lines typically cover only a small
fraction of the spectrometer's spectral range. Furthermore, their exact
position depends strongly on environmental conditions. A problem is the strong
intensity variation between different (intensity ratios {>300). In addition,
the brightness of the lamps is insufficient to illuminate a spectrograph via an
integrating sphere, which in turn is important to calibrate a long-slit
spectrograph, as this is the only way to assure a uniform illumination of the
spectrograph pupil.
  Laboratory precision laser spectroscopy has experienced a major advance with
the development of optical frequency combs generated by pulsed femto-second
lasers. These lasers emit a broad spectrum (several hundred nanometers in the
visible and near infra-red) of equally-spaced ""comb"" lines with almost uniform
intensity (intensity ratios typically <10). Self-referencing of the laser
establishes a precise ruler in frequency space that can be stabilized to the
10e-18 uncertainty level, reaching absolute frequency inaccuracies at the
10e-12 level per day when using the Global Positioning System's (GPS) time
signal as the reference. The exploration of the merits of this new technology
holds the promise for broad-band, highly accurate and reproducible calibration
required for reliable operation of current and next generation astronomic
spectrometers.
"
What is the position of the incompressible edge states (IES) in the vicinity of a QPC?,"  In this work, we calculate the current distribution, in the close vicinity of
the quantum point contacts (QPCs), taking into account the Coulomb interaction.
In the first step, we calculate the bare confinement potential of a generic QPC
and, in the presence of a perpendicular magnetic field, obtain the positions of
the incompressible edge states (IES) taking into account electron-electron
interaction within the Thomas-Fermi theory of screening. Using a local version
of the Ohm's law, together with a relevant conductivity model, we also
calculate the current distribution. We observe that, the imposed external
current is confined locally into the incompressible strips. Our calculations
demonstrate that, the inclusion of the electron-electron interaction, strongly
changes the general picture of the transport through the QPCs.
"
What is the spin-flip lifetime of a superconducting body affected by non-magnetic impurities?,"  In the present paper we study the spontaneous photon emission due to a
magnetic spin-flip transition of a two-level atom in the vicinity of a
dielectric body like a normal conducting metal or a superconductor. For
temperatures below the transition temperature T_c of a superconductor, the
corresponding spin-flip lifetime is boosted by several orders of magnitude as
compared to the case of a normal conducting body. Numerical results of an exact
formulation are also compared to a previously derived approximative analytical
expression for the spin-flip lifetime and we find an excellent agreement. We
present results on how the spin-flip lifetime depends on the temperature T of a
superconducting body as well as its thickness H. Finally, we study how
non-magnetic impurities as well as possible Eliashberg strong-coupling effects
influence the spin-flip rate. It is found that non-magnetic impurities as well
as strong-coupling effects have no dramatic impact on the spin-flip lifetime.
"
What is the origin of the leptons in the universe?,"  We show how leptogenesis can occur at the TeV scale with neutrinos that
possess almost purely Dirac masses and negligible Majorana mass contributions
as a consequence of the small wavefunction overlap in a warped fifth dimension.
Lepton number violation at the Planck scale is introduced via a Majorana mass
term on the Planck brane. Such a Majorana mass operator leads to the small mass
splitting of otherwise degenerate Kaluza-Klein excited states on the TeV brane.
This tiny mass splitting can compensate for the small Yukawa couplings to give
a CP asymmetry large enough to produce the sufficient baryon asymmetry from the
decay of the nearly degenerate neutrino Kaluza-Klein states. In this way the
standard baryogenesis via leptogenesis scenario can naturally occur at the TeV
scale without the need for a high mass scale.
"
What are the two-phonon beta-vibrational states in 152Sm?,"  Experimental studies of 152Sm using multiple-step Coulomb excitation and
inelastic neutron scattering provide key data that clarify the low-energy
collective structure of this nucleus. No candidates for two-phonon
beta-vibrational states are found. Experimental level energies of the
ground-state and first excited (0+ state) rotational bands, electric monopole
transition rates, reduced quadrupole transition rates, and the isomer shift of
the first excited 2+ state are all described within ~10% precision using
two-band mixing calculations. The basic collective structure of 152Sm is
described using strong mixing of near-degenerate coexisting quasi-rotational
bands with different deformations.
"
What are the implications of the hidden symmetry in the moduli space of the Green-Schwarz superstring?,"  The hidden symmetry and an infinite set non-local conserved currents of the
Green-Schwarz superstring on $AdS_5\otimes S^5$ have been pointed out by Bena
et al. In this paper, we shown that the Hodge dual between the Maurer-Cartan
equation and the equation of motion gives the hidden symmetry in the moduli
space of Green-Schwarz superstring. Thus by twisty transforming the vielbeins,
we can express the currents of the paper$^{\cite{bpr}}$ as the Lax connections
by a unique spectral parameter.
"
What are the properties of the valuation formula in the theory?,"  We develop a theory for pricing non-diversifiable mortality risk in an
incomplete market. We do this by assuming that the company issuing a
mortality-contingent claim requires compensation for this risk in the form of a
pre-specified instantaneous Sharpe ratio. We prove that our ensuing valuation
formula satisfies a number of desirable properties. For example, we show that
it is subadditive in the number of contracts sold. A key result is that if the
hazard rate is stochastic, then the risk-adjusted survival probability is
greater than the physical survival probability, even as the number of contracts
approaches infinity.
"
What are the first observation of bottom baryon Σb(∗)± states?,"  We present recent CDF results based on approximately 1 fb$^{-1}$ of $p\bar p$
collisions at $\sqrt s = 1.96$ TeV delivered at Fermilab Tevatron. Results
shown include the observation of the $B_s$ oscillation frequency, the first
observation of bottom baryon $\Sigma_b^{(*)\pm}$ states, updates on $B$ hadrons
lifetimes, and searches for rare decays in the $b\to s\mu^+\mu^-$ transition
and in charmless two-body B decays.
"
What are the implications of the exchange bias effect for the development of new magnetic materials and devices?,"  The exchange bias (EB) effect was discovered 60 years ago by Meiklejohn and
Bean. Meanwhile the EB effect has become an integral part of modern magnetism
with implications for basic research and for numerous device applications. The
EB effect was the first of its kind which relates to an interface effect
between two different classes of materials, here between a ferromagnet and an
antiferromagnet. Here we review fundamental aspects of the exchange bias
effect.
"
What is the generalization of the Wigner surmise for the probability distribution of single level spacing?,"  We obtain analytic formulae for the spacing between conductance peaks in the
Coulomb blockade regime, based on the universal Hamiltonian model of quantum
dots. New random matrix theory results are developed in order to treat
correlations between two and three consecutive spacings in the energy level
spectrum. These are generalizations of the Wigner surmise for the probability
distribution of single level spacing. The analytic formulae are shown to be in
good agreement with numerical evaluation.

What are the optical properties of zinc monochalcogenides with zinc-blende and wurtzite structures studied using the ab initio density functional method?,"  Electronic band structure and optical properties of zinc monochalcogenides
with zinc-blende- and wurtzite-type structures were studied using the ab initio
density functional method within the LDA, GGA, and LDA+U approaches.
Calculations of the optical spectra have been performed for the energy range
0-20 eV, with and without including spin-orbit coupling. Reflectivity,
absorption and extinction coefficients, and refractive index have been computed
from the imaginary part of the dielectric function using the Kramers--Kronig
transformations. A rigid shift of the calculated optical spectra is found to
provide a good first approximation to reproduce experimental observations for
almost all the zinc monochalcogenide phases considered. By inspection of the
calculated and experimentally determined band-gap values for the zinc
monochalcogenide series, the band gap of ZnO with zinc-blende structure has
been estimated.
"
What are the assumptions on F for the generalized evolution of level sets to be satisfied?,"  We consider the generalized evolution of compact level sets by functions of
their normal vectors and second fundamental forms on a Riemannian manifold M.
The level sets of a function $u:M\to\mathbb{R}$ evolve in such a way whenever u
solves an equation $u_{t}+F(Du, D^{2}u)=0$, for some real function F satisfying
a geometric condition. We show existence and uniqueness of viscosity solutions
to this equation under the assumptions that M has nonnegative curvature, F is
continuous off Du=0, (degenerate) elliptic, and locally invariant by parallel
translation. We then prove that this approach is geometrically consistent,
hence it allows to define a generalized evolution of level sets by very
general, singular functions of their curvatures. For instance, these
assumptions on F are satisfied when F is given by the evolutions of level sets
by their mean curvature (even in arbitrary codimension) or by their positive
Gaussian curvature. We also prove that the generalized evolution is consistent
with the classical motion by the corresponding function of the curvature,
whenever the latter exists. When M is not of nonnegative curvature, the same
results hold if one additionally requires that F is uniformly continuous with
respect to D^2 u. Finally we give some counterexamples showing that several
well known properties of the evolutions in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ are no longer true
when M has negative sectional curvature.
"
What is the percolation signature of Ising spin glass ordering in three dimensions?,"  Magnetic ordering at low temperature for Ising ferromagnets manifests itself
within the associated Fortuin-Kasteleyn (FK) random cluster representation as
the occurrence of a single positive density percolating network. In this paper
we investigate the percolation signature for Ising spin glass ordering -- both
in short-range (EA) and infinite-range (SK) models -- within a two-replica FK
representation and also within the different Chayes-Machta-Redner two-replica
graphical representation. Based on numerical studies of the $\pm J$ EA model in
three dimensions and on rigorous results for the SK model, we conclude that the
spin glass transition corresponds to the appearance of {\it two} percolating
clusters of {\it unequal} densities.
"
What are the main results of the interactions between massive X-ray binaries and the surrounding interstellar medium?,"  Massive X-ray binaries are formed by a compact object that accretes matter
from the stellar wind of an early-type donor star. In some of these systems,
called microquasars, relativistic jets are launched from the surroundings of
the compact object. Such jets interact with the photon field of the companion
star, the stellar wind, and, at large distances, with the interstellar medium.
In this paper I will review the main results of such interactions with
particular emphasis on the production of high-energy photons and neutrinos. The
case of some specific systems, like LS I +61 303, will be discussed in some
detail. Prospects for future observations at different wavelengths of this type
of objects will be presented.
"
What is the complex relativity represented by self-dual complex 2-forms?,"  An alternative to the representation of complex relativity by self-dual
complex 2-forms on the spacetime manifold is presented by assuming that that
the bundle of real 2-forms is given an almost-complex structure. From this, one
can define a complex orthogonal structure on the bundle of 2-forms, which
results in a more direct representation of the complex orthogonal group in
three complex dimensions. The geometrical foundations of general relativity are
then presented in terms of the bundle of oriented complex orthogonal 3-frames
on the bundle of 2-forms in a manner that essentially parallels their
construction in terms of self-dual complex 2-forms. It is shown that one can
still discuss the Debever-Penrose classification of the Riemannian curvature
tensor in terms of the representation presented here.
"
What is the vacuum energy-momentum tensor of a scalar field with general curvature coupling parameter?,"  We investigate the Hadamard function, the vacuum expectation values of the
field square and the energy-momentum tensor of a scalar field with general
curvature coupling parameter in de Sitter spacetime compactified along one of
spatial dimensions. By using the Abel-Plana summation formula, we have
explicitly extracted from the vacuum expectation values the part due to the
compactness of the spatial dimension. The topological part in the vacuum
energy-momentum tensor violates the local de Sitter symmetry and dominates in
the early stages of the cosmological evolution. At late times the corresponding
vacuum stresses are isotropic and the topological part corresponds to an
effective gravitational source with barotropic equation of state.
"
What is the ratio of the eigenfrequencies of the fluid tori around a black hole to those of free particles?,"  We study epicyclic oscillations of fluid tori around black holes (in the
Paczynski-Wiita potential) and derive exact analytic expressions for their
radial and vertical eigenfrequencies nu_r and nu_z to second-order accuracy in
the width of the torus. We prove that pressure effects make the
eigenfrequencies smaller than those for free particles. However, the particular
ratio nu_z/nu_r=3/2, which is important for the theory of high-frequency
quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs), occurs when the fluid tori epicyclic
frequencies nu_r and nu_z are about 15% higher than the ones corresponding to
free particles. Our results therefore suggest that previous estimates of black
hole spins from QPOs have produced values that are too high.
"
What is the observed difference in magnetic activity between L and T dwarfs compared to M dwarfs?,"  Magnetic activity in ultracool dwarfs, as measured in X-rays and H$\alpha$,
shows a steep decline after spectral type M7-M8. So far, no L dwarf has been
detected in X-rays. In contrast, L dwarfs may have higher radio activity than M
dwarfs. We observe L and T dwarfs simultaneously in X-rays and radio to
determine their level of magnetic activity in the context of the general
decline of magnetic activity with cooler effective temperatures. The field L
dwarf binary Kelu-1 was observed simultaneously with Chandra and the Very Large
Array. Kelu-1AB was detected in X-rays with $L_{\rm X} = 2.9_{-1.3}^{+1.8}
\times 10^{25}$ erg/s, while it remained undetected in the radio down to a $3
\sigma$ limit of $L_{\rm R} \leq 1.4 \times 10^{13}$ erg/s/Hz. We argue that,
whereas the X-ray and H$\alpha$ emissions decline in ultracool dwarfs with
decreasing effective temperature, the radio luminosity stays (more or less)
constant across M and early-L dwarfs. The radio surface flux or the luminosity
may better trace magnetic activity in ultracool dwarfs than the ratio of the
luminosity to the bolometric luminosity. Deeper radio observations (and at
short frequencies) are required to determine if and when the cut-off in radio
activity occurs in L and T dwarfs, and what kind of emission mechanism takes
place in ultracool dwarfs.
"
Is the Renormalization Group (RG) flow in the worldsheet sigma model monotonic?,"  Tseytlin has recently proposed that an action functional exists whose
gradient generates to all orders in perturbation theory the Renormalization
Group (RG) flow of the target space metric in the worldsheet sigma model. The
gradient is defined with respect to a metric on the space of coupling constants
which is explicitly known only to leading order in perturbation theory, but at
that order is positive semi-definite, as follows from Perelman's work on the
Ricci flow. This gives rise to a monotonicity formula for the flow which is
expected to fail only if the beta function perturbation series fails to
converge, which can happen if curvatures or their derivatives grow large. We
test the validity of the monotonicity formula at next-to-leading order in
perturbation theory by explicitly computing the second-order terms in the
metric on the space of coupling constants. At this order, this metric is found
not to be positive semi-definite. In situations where this might spoil
monotonicity, derivatives of curvature become large enough for higher order
perturbative corrections to be significant.
"
What is the motion of a micro-scale swimmer that uses a chemical reaction catalyzed on its own surface to achieve autonomous propulsion characterized experimentally?,"  The motion of an artificial micro-scale swimmer that uses a chemical reaction
catalyzed on its own surface to achieve autonomous propulsion is fully
characterized experimentally. It is shown that at short times, it has a
substantial component of directed motion, with a velocity that depends on the
concentration of fuel molecules. At longer times, the motion reverts to a
random walk with a substantially enhanced diffusion coefficient. Our results
suggest strategies for designing artificial chemotactic systems.
"
What is the role of oxygen vacancies in the resistance-change memory in these materials?,"  Transition-metal oxides exhibiting a bistable resistance state are attractive
for non-volatile memory applications. The relevance of oxygen vacancies (VO)
for the resistance-change memory was investigated with x-ray fluorescence,
infrared microscopy, and x-ray absorption spectroscopy using Cr-doped SrTiO3 as
example. We propose that the microscopic origin of resistance switching in this
class of materials is due to an oxygen-vacancy drift occurring in close
proximity to one of the electrodes.
"
What are the characteristics of residual-based kernel estimators?,"  Convergence rates of kernel density estimators for stationary time series are
well studied. For invertible linear processes, we construct a new density
estimator that converges, in the supremum norm, at the better, parametric, rate
$n^{-1/2}$. Our estimator is a convolution of two different residual-based
kernel estimators. We obtain in particular convergence rates for such
residual-based kernel estimators; these results are of independent interest.
"
What is the phase diagram of the bilinear-biquadratic spin 1 chain in a zig-zag geometry?,"  Recent theoretical studies raised the possibility of a realization of spin
nematic states in the S=1 triangular lattice compound NiGa_2S_4. We study the
bilinear-biquadratic spin 1 chain in a zig-zag geometry by means of the density
matrix renormalization group method and exact diagonalization. We present the
phase diagram focusing on antiferromagnetic interactions. Adjacent to the known
Haldane-double Haldane and the extended critical phase with dominant spin
nematic correlations we find a trimerized phase with a nonvanishing energy gap.
We discuss results for different order parameters, energy gaps, correlation
functions, and the central charge, and make connection to field theoretical
predictions for the phase diagram.
"
Does the absence of broad lines in Seyfert-2 galaxies indicate a fundamentally different nuclear structure?,"  Half of the Seyfert-2 galaxies escaped detection of broad lines in their
polarised spectra observed so far. Some authors have suspected that these
non-HBLRs contain real Sy2 nuclei without intrinsic broad line region hidden
behind a dust torus. If this were true, then their nuclear structure would
fundamentally differ from that of Sy2s with polarised broad lines: in
particular, they would not be explained by orientation-based AGN unification.
Further arguments for two physically different Sy2 populations have been
derived from the warm and cool IRAS F25/F60 ratios. These ratios, however,
refer to the entire host galaxies and are unsuitable to conclusively establish
the absence of a nuclear dust torus. Instead, a study of the Seyfert-2
dichotomy should be performed on the basis of nuclear properties only. Here we
present the first comparison between [OIII] 5007A and mid-infrared imaging at
matching spatial resolution. Exploring the Seyfert-2 dichotomy we find that the
distributions of nuclear mid-infrared/[OIII] luminosity ratios are
indistinguishable for Sy1s and Sy2s with and without detected polarised broad
lines and irrespective of having warm or cool IRAS F25/F60 ratios. We find no
evidence for the existence of a population of real Sy2s with a deficit of
nuclear dust emission. Our results suggest 1) that all Seyfert nuclei possess
the same physical structure including the putative dust torus and 2) that the
cool IRAS colours are caused by a low contrast of AGN to host galaxy. Then the
Seyfert-2 dichotomy is explained in part by unification of non-HBLRs with
narrow-line Sy1s and to a larger rate by observational biases caused by a low
AGN/host contrast and/or an unfavourable scattering geometry.
"
What is the SLIV which evolves in a general Yang-Mills type theory?,"  We argue that non-Abelian gauge fields can be treated as the pseudo-Goldstone
vector bosons caused by spontaneous Lorentz invariance violation (SLIV). To
this end, the SLIV which evolves in a general Yang-Mills type theory with the
nonlinear vector field constraint $Tr(% \boldsymbol{A}_{\mu
}\boldsymbol{A}^{\mu})=\pm M^{2}$ ($M$ is a proposed SLIV scale) imposed is
considered in detail. With an internal symmetry group $G$ having $D$ generators
not only the pure Lorentz symmetry SO(1,3), but the larger accidental symmetry
$SO(D,3D)$ of the SLIV constraint in itself appears to be spontaneously broken
as well. As a result, while the pure Lorentz violation still generates only one
genuine Goldstone vector boson, the accompanying pseudo-Goldstone vector bosons
related to the $SO(D,3D)$ breaking also come into play in the final arrangement
of the entire Goldstone vector field multiplet. Remarkably, they remain
strictly massless, being protected by gauge invariance of the Yang-Mills theory
involved. We show that, although this theory contains a plethora of Lorentz and
$CPT$ violating couplings, they do not lead to physical SLIV effects which turn
out to be strictly cancelled in all the lowest order processes considered.
However, the physical Lorentz violation could appear if the internal gauge
invariance were slightly broken at very small distances influenced by gravity.
For the SLIV scale comparable with the Planck one the Lorentz violation could
become directly observable at low energies.
"
How does the speed of adaptation in an asexual population relate to the dynamics of the stochastic edge of the population?,"  In a recent article, Desai and Fisher (2007) proposed that the speed of
adaptation in an asexual population is determined by the dynamics of the
stochastic edge of the population, that is, by the emergence and subsequent
establishment of rare mutants that exceed the fitness of all sequences
currently present in the population. Desai and Fisher perform an elaborate
stochastic calculation of the mean time $\tau$ until a new class of mutants has
been established, and interpret $1/\tau$ as the speed of adaptation. As they
note, however, their calculations are valid only for moderate speeds. This
limitation arises from their method to determine $\tau$: Desai and Fisher
back-extrapolate the value of $\tau$ from the best-fit class' exponential
growth at infinite time. This approach is not valid when the population adapts
rapidly, because in this case the best-fit class grows non-exponentially during
the relevant time interval. Here, we substantially extend Desai and Fisher's
analysis of the stochastic edge. We show that we can apply Desai and Fisher's
method to high speeds by either exponentially back-extrapolating from finite
time or using a non-exponential back-extrapolation. Our results are compatible
with predictions made using a different analytical approach (Rouzine et al.
2003, 2007), and agree well with numerical simulations.
"
What are the experimental techniques used to measure the changes in polarization state of a laser in a strong transverse magnetic field in a vacuum?,"  We discuss the experimental techniques used to date for measuring the changes
in polarization state of a laser produced by a strong transverse magnetic field
acting in a vacuum. We point out the likely artifacts that can arise in such
experiments, with particular reference to the recent PVLAS observations and the
previous findings of the BFRT collaboration. Our observations are based on
studies with a photon-noise limited coherent homodyne interferometer with a
polarization sensitivity of 2x10^-8 rad Hz^(1/2) mW^(-1/2).
"
What is the tool Hector used to simulate the LHC beamlines?,"  Computing the trajectories of particles in generic beamlines is an important
ingredient of experimental particle physics, in particular regarding near-beam
detectors. A new tool, Hector, has been built for such calculations, using the
transfer matrix approach and energy corrections. The limiting aperture effects
are also taken into account. As an illustration, the tool was used to simulate
the LHC beamlines, in particular around the high luminosity interaction points
(IPs), and validated with results of the Mad-X simulator. The LHC beam
profiles, trajectories and beta functions are presented. Assuming certain
forward proton detector scenarios around the IP5, acceptance plots, irradiation
doses and chromaticity grids are produced. Furthermore, the reconstruction of
proton kinematic variables at the IP (energy and angle) is studied as well as
the impact of the misalignment of beamline elements.
"
What are the preliminary results of the analysis of the broadband spectral energy distribution of a quiescent black hole binary?,"  With their relatively fast variability time-scales, Galactic X-ray binaries
provide an excellent laboratory to explore the physics of accretion and related
phenomena, most notably outflows, over different regimes. After comparing the
phenomenology of jets in black hole X-ray binary systems to that of neutron
stars, here I discuss the role of the jet at very low Eddington ratios, and
present preliminary results obtained by fitting the broadband spectral energy
distribution of a quiescent black hole binary with a `maximally jet-dominated'
model.
"
What is the supersymmetric quantum mechanics with three-component normal modes?,"  We consider the supersymmetric quantum mechanics (SUSY QM) with three-
component normal modes for the Bogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield (BPS) states. An
explicit form of the SUSY QM matrix superpotential is presented and the
corresponding three-component bosonic zero-mode eigenfunction is investigated.
"
What are the implications of the renormalization group method for fluctuation-driven first-order phase transitions?,"  Using the renormalization group method, new type of fluctuation-driven first
order phase transitions and critical phenomena are predicted for certain
classes of ferromagnetic superconductors and superfluids with unconventional
(spin-triplet) Cooper pairing. The problem for the quantum phase transitions at
extremely low and zero temperatures is also discussed. The results can be
applied to a wide class of ferromagnetic superconductive and superfluid
systems, in particular, to itinerant ferromagnets as UGe2 and URhGe.
"
What are the parameters in the model taken from experiments on (EDO-TTF)_2PF_6?,"  Photoinduced melting of charge order is calculated by using the exact
many-electron wave function coupled with classically treated phonons in the
one-dimensional quarter-filled Hubbard model with Peierls and Holstein types of
electron-phonon couplings. The model parameters are taken from recent
experiments on (EDO-TTF)_2PF_6 (EDO-TTF=ethylenedioxy-tetrathiafulvalene) with
(0110) charge order, where transfer integrals are modulated by molecular
displacements (bond-coupled phonons) and site energies by molecular
deformations (charge-coupled phonons). The charge-transfer photoexcitation from
(0110) to (0200) configurations and that from (0110) to (1010) configurations
have different energies. The corresponding excited states have different shapes
of adiabatic potentials as a function of these two phonon amplitudes. The
adiabatic potentials are shown to be useful in understanding differences in the
photoinduced charge dynamics and the efficiency of melting, which depend not
only on the excitation energy but also on the relative phonon frequency of the
bond- and charge-coupled phonons.
"
What are the wavevectors observed in thin films on different substrates?,"  The coupling of the manganite stripe phase to the lattice and to strain has
been investigated via transmission electron microscopy studies of
polycrystalline and thin film manganites. In polycrystalline \PCMOfiftwo a
lockin to $q/a^*=0.5$ in a sample with $x>0.5$ has been observed for the first
time. Such a lockin has been predicted as a key part of the Landau CDW theory
of the stripe phase. Thus it is possible to constrain the size of the
electron-phonon coupling in the CDW Landau theory to between 0.04% and 0.05% of
the electron-electron coupling term. In the thin film samples, films of the
same thickness grown on two different substrates exhibited different
wavevectors. The different strains present in the films on the two substrates
can be related to the wavevector observed via Landau theory. It is demonstrated
that the the elastic term which favours an incommensurate modulation has a
similar size to the coupling between the strain and the wavevector, meaning
that the coupling of strain to the superlattice is unexpectedly strong.
"
What is the QCD evolution equation derived from the jet calculus?,"  Ordinary fracture functions, describing hadrons production in the deep
inelastic scattering target fragmentation region, are generalized to account
for the production of hadrons in arbitrary number, thus offering a renewed
framework for dealing with QCD initial state radiation. We also propose a new
jet-like observable which measures beam remnants and low-$p_{\perp}$ scattering
fragments and derive its QCD evolution equations by using Jet Calculus.
Possible implications for semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering and
hadron-hadron reactions are shortly discussed.
"
What is the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect and the Ostriker-Vishniac effect?,"  In this paper we study the possibility of detecting lensing signals in
high-resolution and high-sensitivity CMB experiments. At scales below 1 arcmin,
the CMB background is dominated by the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect in clusters
and by Ostriker-Vishniac effect distortions elsewhere. Assuming the
Sunyaev-Zel'dovich component in clusters can be removed, we focus on the
Ostriker-Vishniac effect and study the possibility of its detection while
paying special attention to contaminants, such as instrumental noise and point
sources. After designing an optimal filter for this particular lensing signal
we explore the signal-to-noise ratio for different scenarios varying the
resolution of the experiment, its sensitivity, and the level of contamination
due to point sources. Our results show that the next generation of experiments
should be able to do new and exciting science through the lensing effect of the
Ostriker-Vishniac background.
"
"What is the GLCS, which was first proposed by Noro and Frenkel?","  Colloidal systems (and protein solutions) are often characterized by
attractive interactions whose range is much smaller than the particle size.
When this is the case and the interaction is spherical, systems obey a
generalized law of correspondent states (GLCS), first proposed by Noro and
Frenkel [ J.Chem.Phys. 113, 2941 (2000) ]. The thermodynamic properties become
insensitive to the details of the potential, depending only on the value of the
second virial coefficient B_2 and the density $\rho$. The GLCS does not
generically hold for the case of non-spherical potentials. In this Letter we
suggest that when particles interact via short-ranged small-angular amplitude
patchy interactions (so that the condition of only one bond per patch is
fulfilled) it is still possible to generalize the GLCS close to the liquid-gas
critical point. Keywords: Colloids, Second Virial Coefficient, Proteins
interactions, Short-ranged attractive attractions.
"
What is the Gauss map of non-degenerate surfaces in three-dimensional Minkowski space?,"  The Gauss map of non-degenerate surfaces in the three-dimensional Minkowski
space are viewed as dynamical fields of the two-dimensional O(2,1) Nonlinear
Sigma Model. In this setting, the moduli space of solutions with rotational
symmetry is completely determined. Essentially, the solutions are warped
products of orbits of the 1-dimensional groups of isometries and elastic curves
in either a de Sitter plane, a hyperbolic plane or an anti de Sitter plane. The
main tools are the equivalence of the two-dimensional O(2,1) Nonlinear Sigma
Model and the Willmore problem, and the description of the surfaces with
rotational symmetry. A complete classification of such surfaces is obtained in
this paper. Indeed, a huge new family of Lorentzian rotational surfaces with a
space-like axis is presented. The description of this new class of surfaces is
based on a technique of surgery and a gluing process, which is illustrated by
an algorithm.
"
What is the metric of space-time in the non-relativistic limit of Einstein equation?,"  In particular cases of stationary and stationary axially symmetric space-time
passage to non-relativistic limit of Einstein equation is completed. For this
end the notions of absolute space and absolute time are introduced due to
stationarity of the space-time under consideration. In this construction
absolute time is defined as a function $t$ on the space-time such that $\prt_t$
is exactly the Killing vector and the space at different moments is presented
by the surfaces $t=\con $. The space-time metric is expressed in terms of
metric of the 3-space and two potentials one of which is exactly Newtonian
gravitational potential $\Phi$, another is vector potential $\vec A$ which,
however, differs from vector potential known in classical electrodynamics. In
the first-order approximation on $\Phi/c^2$, $|\vec A|/c$ Einstein equation is
reduced to a system for these functions in which left-hand sides contain
Laplacian of the Newtonian potential, derivatives of the vector potential and
curvature of the space and the right-hand sides do 3-dimensional stress tensor
and densities of mass and energy. Subj-class: Classical Physics
"
What is the purpose of mapping the evolution variables into four-momenta?,"  This work covers methodology of solving QCD evolution equation of the parton
distribution using Markovian Monte Carlo (MMC) algorithms in a class of models
ranging from DGLAP to CCFM. One of the purposes of the above MMCs is to test
the other more sophisticated Monte Carlo programs, the so-called Constrained
Monte Carlo (CMC) programs, which will be used as a building block in the
parton shower MC. This is why the mapping of the evolution variables (eikonal
variable and evolution time) into four-momenta is also defined and tested. The
evolution time is identified with the rapidity variable of the emitted parton.
The presented MMCs are tested independently, with ~0.1% precision, against the
non-MC program APCheb especially devised for this purpose.
"
What is the difference between the TF-muSR and rf inductive measurements of the penetration depth in PrOs4Sb12?,"  The effective superconducting penetration depth measured in the vortex state
of PrOs4Sb12 using transverse-field muon spin rotation (TF-muSR) exhibits an
activated temperature dependence at low temperatures, consistent with a nonzero
gap for quasiparticle excitations. In contrast, Meissner-state radiofrequency
(rf) inductive measurements of the penetration depth yield a T^2 temperature
dependence, suggestive of point nodes in the gap. A scenario based on the
recent discovery of extreme two-band superconductivity in PrOs4Sb12 is proposed
to resolve this difference. In this picture a large difference between large-
and small-gap coherence lengths renders the field distribution in the vortex
state controlled mainly by supercurrents from a fully-gapped large-gap band. In
zero field all bands contribute, yielding a stronger temperature dependence to
the rf inductive measurements.
"
What is the Coxeter group consisting of a hyperbolic 3-simplex reflection group?,"  A hyperbolic 3-simplex reflection group is a Coxeter group arising as a
lattice in the isometry group of hyperbolic 3-space, with fundamental domain a
geodesic simplex (possibly with some ideal vertices). The classification of
these groups is known, and there are exactly 9 cocompact examples, and 23
non-cocompact examples. We provide a complete computation of the lower
algebraic K-theory of the integral group ring of all the hyperbolic 3-simplex
reflection groups.
"
What is the role of stochastic fluctuations in the time course of caspase-3 activation in the type 2 apoptotic pathway?,"  Apoptosis, or genetically programmed cell death, is a crucial cellular
process that maintains the balance between life and death in cells. The precise
molecular mechanism of apoptosis signaling and how these two pathways are
differentially activated under distinct apoptotic stimuli is poorly understood.
We developed a Monte Carlo-based stochastic simulation model that can
characterize distinct signaling behaviors in the two major pathways of
apoptotic signaling using a novel probability distribution-based approach.
Specifically, we show that for a weak death signal, such as low levels of death
ligand Fas (CD95) binding or under stress conditions, the type 2 mitochondrial
pathway dominates apoptotic signaling. Our results also show signaling in the
type 2 pathway is stochastic, where the population average over many cells does
not capture the cell-to-cell fluctuations in the time course (~1 - 10 hours) of
downstream caspase-3 activation. On the contrary, the probability distribution
of caspase-3 activation for the mitochondrial pathway shows a distinct bimodal
behavior that can be used to characterize the stochastic signaling in type 2
apoptosis. Interestingly, such stochastic fluctuations in apoptosis signaling
happen even in the presence of large numbers of signaling molecules. In a
fluctuating environment, such stochasticity in the timecourse of caspase-3
activation may be an adaptive mechanism for allowing a competing survival
signal to win over a weak death trigger before the critical cell fate decision
is made and thus minimizes the risk of pathologies.
"
What is the Renner mixing of nearly-degenerate states or the dynamic-Renner mixing of degenerate states of whatever symmetry?,"  We summarize a few proposals for mixing F center states through the mediation
of an appropriate symmetry-breaking vibrational mode. Electron-mode coupling
energies odd-order in the mode coordinates are characteristic of the
pseudo-Jahn-Teller mixing of nearly-degenerate opposite-parity electronic
states mediated by an odd-parity vibrational mode. Coupling energies even order
in the vibrational coordinates lead to a pseudo-Renner mixing of even parity
nearly-degenerate states or to dynamic-Renner mixing of degenerate states of
whatever symmetry. Both Renner mixing energies add up to widen the crossover
splitting of the adiabatic energies thereby enhancing the nonradiative
deexcitation rate.
"
What are the implications of the FIR-X-ray luminosity ratio for the study of starbursts?,"  The study of massive star formation needs some basic tools, among which
reliable SFR tracers are crucial ones. We are presently revising the
calibration of SFR tracers at different wavelength ranges using last generation
evolutionary population synthesis codes. The FIR luminosity produced by the
heated dust in star forming regions is commonly used to characterize a
starburst. The X-ray luminosity has been found to show a narrow correlation
with it, and therefore it has been proposed as an additional tracer of
potential interest for high $z$ galaxies, whose FIR emission is redshifted to
the sub-mm range. In this communication we analyze the evolution of the X-ray
to FIR luminosities ratio as predicted by the CMHK population synthesis models,
both for constant stellar formation and instantaneous bursts. The results are
compared to some sample data taken from the literature. The conclusion drawn
from the comparison is that the empirical calibration of the soft X-ray
luminosity seems a valid SFR tracer only for starbursts around a rather short
period of time.
"
What are the maximally-symmetric spacetimes in the Robertson-Walker form?,"  It is shown that only the maximally-symmetric spacetimes can be expressed in
both the Robertson-Walker form and in static form - there are no other static
forms of the Robertson-Walker spacetimes. All possible static forms of the
metric of the maximally-symmetric spacetimes are presented as a table. The
findings are generalized to apply to functionally more general spacetimes: it
is shown that the maximally symmetric spacetimes are also the only spacetimes
that can be written in both orthogonal-time isotropic form and in static form.
"
What are the key concepts in a semantic network substrate for computing?,"  These lecture notes describe the current state of affairs for Manin's
conjecture in the context of del Pezzo surfaces.
"
What is the maximum recoil velocity of the final merged black hole in binary black-hole systems with aligned spins?,"  Binary black-hole systems with spins aligned with the orbital angular
momentum are of special interest, as studies indicate that this configuration
is preferred in nature. If the spins of the two bodies differ, there can be a
prominent beaming of the gravitational radiation during the late plunge,
causing a recoil of the final merged black hole. We perform an accurate and
systematic study of recoil velocities from a sequence of equal-mass black holes
whose spins are aligned with the orbital angular momentum, and whose individual
spins range from a = +0.584 to -0.584. In this way we extend and refine the
results of a previous study and arrive at a consistent maximum recoil of 448 +-
5 km/s for anti-aligned models as well as to a phenomenological expression for
the recoil velocity as a function of spin ratio. This relation highlights a
nonlinear behavior, not predicted by the PN estimates, and can be readily
employed in astrophysical studies on the evolution of binary black holes in
massive galaxies. An essential result of our analysis is the identification of
different stages in the waveform, including a transient due to lack of an
initial linear momentum in the initial data. Furthermore we are able to
identify a pair of terms which are largely responsible for the kick, indicating
that an accurate computation can be obtained from modes up to l=3. Finally, we
provide accurate measures of the radiated energy and angular momentum, finding
these to increase linearly with the spin ratio, and derive simple expressions
for the final spin and the radiated angular momentum which can be easily
implemented in N-body simulations of compact stellar systems. Our code is
calibrated with strict convergence tests and we verify the correctness of our
measurements by using multiple independent methods whenever possible.

How does the time evolution of $\beta^+$-activity profiles differ between $^{3}$He and $^{12}$C ion beams?,"  We study the spatial distributions of $\beta^+$-activity produced by
therapeutic beams of $^3$He and $^{12}$C ions in various tissue-like materials.
The calculations were performed within a Monte Carlo model for Heavy-Ion
Therapy (MCHIT) based on the GEANT4 toolkit. The contributions from
$^{10,11}$C, $^{13}$N, $^{14,15}$O, $^{17,18}$F and $^{30}$P positron-emitting
nuclei were calculated and compared with experimental data obtained during and
after irradiation. Positron emitting nuclei are created by $^{12}$C beam in
fragmentation reactions of projectile and target nuclei. This leads to a
$\beta^+$-activity profile characterised by a noticeable peak located close to
the Bragg peak in the corresponding depth-dose distribution. On the contrary,
as the most of positron-emitting nuclei are produced by $^3$He beam in target
fragmentation reactions, the calculated total $\beta^+$-activity during or soon
after the irradiation period is evenly distributed within the projectile range.
However, we predict also the presence of $^{13}$N, $^{14}$O, $^{17,18}$F
created in charge-transfer reactions by low-energy $^3$He ions close to the end
of their range in several tissue-like media. The time evolution of
$\beta^+$-activity profiles was investigated for both kinds of beams. Due to
the production of $^{18}$F nuclide the $\beta^+$-activity profile measured 2 or
3 hours after irradiation with $^{3}$He ions will have a distinct peak
correlated with the maximum of depth-dose distribution. We found certain
advantages of low-energy $^{3}$He beams over low-energy proton beams for
reliable PET monitoring during particle therapy of shallow located tumours. In
this case the distal edge of $\beta^+$-activity distribution from $^{17}$F
nuclei clearly marks the range of $^{3}$He in tissues.
"
How do the IR luminosities and star formation rates of z~1 early-type galaxies compare to the predictions of the Bruzual & Charlot (2003) model?,"  We measure the obscured star formation in z~1 early-type galaxies. This
constrains the influence of star formation on their optical/near-IR colors,
which, we found, are redder than predicted by the model by Bruzual & Charlot
(2003). From deep ACS imaging we construct a sample of 95 morphologically
selected early-type galaxies in the HDF-N and CDF-S with spectroscopic
redshifts in the range 0.85<z<1.15. We measure their 24 micron fluxes from the
deep GOODS-MIPS imaging and derive the IR luminosities and star formation
rates. The fraction of galaxies with >2 sigma detections (~25 muJy} is
17(-4,+9)%. Of the 15 galaxies with significant detections at least six have an
AGN. Stacking the MIPS images of the galaxies without significant detections
and adding the detected galaxies without AGN we find an upper limit on the mean
star formation rate (SFR) of 5.2+/-3.0 Msol yr^-1, and on the mean specific SFR
of 4.6+/-2.2 * 10^-11 yr^-1. Under the assumption that the average SFR will
decline at the same rate as the cosmic average, the in situ growth in stellar
mass of the early-type galaxy population is less than 14+/-7% between z=1 and
the present. We show that the typically low IR luminosity and SFR imply that
the effect of obscured star formation (or AGN) on their rest-frame
optical/near-IR SEDs is negligible for ~90% of the galaxies in our sample.
Hence, their optical/near-IR colors are most likely dominated by evolved
stellar populations. This implies that the colors predicted by the Bruzual &
Charlot (2003) model for stellar populations with ages similar to those of z~1
early-type galaxies (~1-3 Gyr) are most likely too blue, and that stellar
masses of evolved, high-redshift galaxies can be overestimated by up to a
factor of ~2.
"
What is the effect of the magnetic field on the low-temperature equilibrium heat capacity of the quasi-1 D organic compound TMTTF2Br?,"  We have investigated the effect of the magnetic field (B) on the very
low-temperature equilibrium heat capacity ceq of the quasi-1 D organic compound
(TMTTF)2Br, characterized by a commensurate Spin Density Wave (SDW) ground
state. Below 1K, ceq is dominated by a Schottky-like contribution, very
sensitive to the experimental time scale, a property that we have previously
measured in numerous DW compounds. Under applied field (in the range 0.2- 7 T),
the equilibrium dynamics, and hence ceq extracted from the time constant,
increases enormously. For B = 2-3 T, ceq varies like B2, in agreement with a
magnetic Zeeman coupling. Another specific property, common to other
Charge/Spin density wave (DW) compounds, is the occurrence of metastable
branches in ceq, induced at very low temperature by the field exceeding a
critical value. These effects are discussed within a generalization to SDWs in
a magnetic field of the available Larkin-Ovchinnikov local model of strong
pinning. A limitation of the model when compared to experiments is pointed out.
"
What is the boundary state of the D-brane configuration?,"  Open topological string amplitudes on compact Calabi-Yau threefolds are shown
to satisfy an extension of the holomorphic anomaly equation of Bershadsky,
Cecotti, Ooguri and Vafa. The total topological charge of the D-brane
configuration must vanish in order to satisfy tadpole cancellation. The
boundary state of such D-branes is holomorphically captured by a Hodge
theoretic normal function. Its Griffiths' infinitesimal invariant is the
analogue of the closed string Yukawa coupling and plays the role of the
terminator in a Feynman diagram expansion for the topological string with
D-branes. The holomorphic anomaly equation is solved and the holomorphic
ambiguity is fixed for some representative worldsheets of low genus and with
few boundaries on the real quintic.
"
What are the physical or quasi-physical models that are used to study the spread of wildland fires?,"  In recent years, advances in computational power and spatial data analysis
(GIS, remote sensing, etc) have led to an increase in attempts to model the
spread and behaviour of wildland fires across the landscape. This series of
review papers endeavours to critically and comprehensively review all types of
surface fire spread models developed since 1990. This paper reviews models of
an empirical or quasi-empirical nature. These models are based solely on the
statistical analysis of experimentally obtained data with or without some
physical framework for the basis of the relations. Other papers in the series
review models of a physical or quasi-physical nature, and mathematical
analogues and simulation models. The main relations of empirical models are
that of wind speed and fuel moisture content with rate of forward spread.
Comparisons are made of the different functional relationships selected by
various authors for these variables.
"
What are the results of a comparison among different kinetic models for the expansion?,"  Recently, the collisionless expansion of spherical nanoplasmas has been
analyzed with a new ergodic model, clarifying the transition from
hydrodynamic-like to Coulomb-explosion regimes, and providing accurate laws for
the relevant features of the phenomenon. A complete derivation of the model is
here presented. The important issue of the self-consistent initial conditions
is addressed by analyzing the initial charging transient due to the electron
expansion, in the approximation of immobile ions. A comparison among different
kinetic models for the expansion is presented, showing that the ergodic model
provides a simplified description, which retains the essential information on
the electron distribution, in particular, the energy spectrum. Results are
presented for a wide range of initial conditions (determined from a single
dimensionless parameter), in excellent agreement with calculations from the
exact Vlasov-Poisson theory, thus providing a complete and detailed
characterization of all the stages of the expansion.
"
What is the origin of the overdamped 1 meV e/h-pair in the LLG equation?,"  The shape of ferromagnetic resonance spectra of highly dispersed, chemically
disordered Fe_{0.2}Pt_{0.8} nanospheres is perfectly described by the solution
of the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation excluding effects by crystalline
anisotropy and superparamagnetic fluctuations. Upon decreasing temperature, the
LLG damping $\alpha(T)$ and a negative g-shift, g(T)-g_0, increase proportional
to the particle magnetic moments determined from the Langevin analysis of the
magnetization isotherms. These novel features are explained by the scattering
of the $q \to 0$ magnon from an electron-hole (e/h) pair mediated by the
spin-orbit coupling, while the sd-exchange can be ruled out. The large
saturation values, $\alpha(0)=0.76$ and $g(0)/g_0-1=-0.37$, indicate the
dominance of an overdamped 1 meV e/h-pair which seems to originate from the
discrete levels of the itinerant electrons in the d_p=3 nm nanoparticles.
"
What is the significance of the plateau in the ratio of transverse momentum distribution of thermal photons to dileptons?,"  It is shown that the ratio of transverse momentum (p_T) distribution of
thermal photons to dileptons produced in heavy ion collisions reaches a plateau
above p_T=1 GeV. We argue that the value of the ratio in the plateau region can
be used to estimate the initial temperature.
"
What are the prospects for constraining the size of extra matter effects in neutrino oscillations?,"  New physics beyond the Standard Model can lead to extra matter effects on
neutrino oscillation if the new interactions distinguish among the three
flavors of neutrino. In Ref.1, we argued that a long-baseline neutrino
oscillation experiment in which the Fermilab-NUMI beam in its high-energy mode
is aimed at the planned Hyper-Kamiokande detector would be capable of
constraining the size of those extra matter effects, provided the vacuum value
of \sin^2 2\theta_{23} is not too close to one. In this talk, we discuss how
such a constraint would translate into limits on the coupling constants and
masses of new particles in models such as topcolor assisted technicolor.
"
What are the conditions under which a linear speed-up is possible for random walks on a graph?,"  We pose a new and intriguing question motivated by distributed computing
regarding random walks on graphs: How long does it take for several independent
random walks, starting from the same vertex, to cover an entire graph? We study
the cover time - the expected time required to visit every node in a graph at
least once - and we show that for a large collection of interesting graphs,
running many random walks in parallel yields a speed-up in the cover time that
is linear in the number of parallel walks. We demonstrate that an exponential
speed-up is sometimes possible, but that some natural graphs allow only a
logarithmic speed-up. A problem related to ours (in which the walks start from
some probabilistic distribution on vertices) was previously studied in the
context of space efficient algorithms for undirected s-t connectivity and our
results yield, in certain cases, an improvement upon some of the earlier
bounds.
"
What is the relationship between the Hall effect and the ion-cyclotron frequency?,"  The Hall effect arises in a plasma when electrons are able to drift with the
magnetic field but ions cannot. In a fully-ionized plasma this occurs for
frequencies between the ion and electron cyclotron frequencies because of the
larger ion inertia. Typically this frequency range lies well above the
frequencies of interest (such as the dynamical frequency of the system under
consideration) and can be ignored. In a weakly-ionized medium, however, the
Hall effect arises through a different mechanism -- neutral collisions
preferentially decouple ions from the magnetic field. This typically occurs at
much lower frequencies and the Hall effect may play an important role in the
dynamics of weakly-ionised systems such as the Earth's ionosphere and
protoplanetary discs.
  To clarify the relationship between these mechanisms we develop an
approximate single-fluid description of a partially ionized plasma that becomes
exact in the fully-ionized and weakly-ionized limits. Our treatment includes
the effects of ohmic, ambipolar, and Hall diffusion. We show that the Hall
effect is relevant to the dynamics of a partially ionized medium when the
dynamical frequency exceeds the ratio of ion to bulk mass density times the
ion-cyclotron frequency, i.e. the Hall frequency. The corresponding length
scale is inversely proportional to the ion to bulk mass density ratio as well
as to the ion-Hall beta parameter.
"
"What is the software solution, Genome3DExplorer, designed to address the challenges of genomic data visualization, scene management, and interaction?","  Biologists are leading current research on genome characterization
(sequencing, alignment, transcription), providing a huge quantity of raw data
about many genome organisms. Extracting knowledge from this raw data is an
important process for biologists, using usually data mining approaches.
However, it is difficult to deals with these genomic information using actual
bioinformatics data mining tools, because data are heterogeneous, huge in
quantity and geographically distributed. In this paper, we present a new
approach between data mining and virtual reality visualization, called visual
data mining. Indeed Virtual Reality becomes ripe, with efficient display
devices and intuitive interaction in an immersive context. Moreover, biologists
use to work with 3D representation of their molecules, but in a desktop
context. We present a software solution, Genome3DExplorer, which addresses the
problem of genomic data visualization, of scene management and interaction.
This solution is based on a well-adapted graphical and interaction paradigm,
where local and global topological characteristics of data are easily visible,
on the contrary to traditional genomic database browsers, always focused on the
zoom and details level.
"
What is the X-ray to optical flux ratio of the newly discovered object?,"  We report discovery of a compact object at high Galactic latitude. The object
was initially identified as a ROSAT All-Sky Survey Bright Source Catalog X-ray
source, 1RXS J141256.0+792204, statistically likely to possess a high X-ray to
optical flux ratio. Further observations using {\em
  Swift}, Gemini-North, and the Chandra X-ray Observatory refined the source
position and confirmed the absence of any optical counterpart to an X-ray to
optical flux ratio of F_X/F_V > 8700 (3 sigma). Interpretation of 1RXS
J141256.0+792204 -- which we have dubbed Calvera -- as a typical X-ray-dim
isolated neutron star would place it at z ~ 5.1 kpc above the Galactic disk --
in the Galactic halo -- implying that it either has an extreme space velocity
(v_z >~ 5100 km s-1) or has failed to cool according to theoretical
predictions. Interpretations as a persistent anomalous X-ray pulsar, or a
``compact central object'' present conflicts with these classes' typical
properties. We conclude the properties of Calvera are most consistent with
those of a nearby (80 to 260 pc) radio pulsar, similar to the radio millisecond
pulsars of 47 Tuc, with further observations required to confirm this
classification. If it is a millisecond pulsar, it has an X-ray flux equal to
the X-ray brightest millisecond pulsar (and so is tied for highest flux); is
the closest northern hemisphere millisecond pulsar; and is potentially the
closest known millisecond pulsar in the sky, making it an interesting target
for X-ray-study, a radio pulsar timing array, and LIGO.
"
What is the mechanism of observed current rectification in oligopeptides?,"  We investigate electrical conduction through individual oligopeptide
molecules thiol-bonded between gold nanocontacts using ab initio and
semi-empirical techniques. Our theory explains for the first time these
molecules' experimentally observed current-voltage characteristics, including
both the magnitude and rectification of the current, and uses no adjustable
parameters. We identify the mechanism of the observed current rectification,
and predict that it will result in negative differential resistance at moderate
biases. Our findings open the way to the realization of protein-based
nanoelectronic devices.
"
What are the techniques used to understand the topology of orbifolds?,"  These notes accompany a lecture about the topology of symplectic (and other)
quotients. The aim is two-fold: first to advertise the ease of computation in
the symplectic category; and second to give an account of some new computations
for weighted projective spaces. We start with a brief exposition of how
orbifolds arise in the symplectic category, and discuss the techniques used to
understand their topology. We then show how these results can be used to
compute the Chen-Ruan orbifold cohomology ring of abelian symplectic
reductions. We conclude by comparing the several rings associated to a weighted
projective space. We make these computations directly, avoiding any mention of
a stacky fan or of a labeled moment polytope.
"
"What is the directed star arboricity of a digraph, and how is it related to the maximum out-degree?","  A digraph is $m$-labelled if every arc is labelled by an integer in $\{1,
\dots,m\}$. Motivated by wavelength assignment for multicasts in optical
networks, we introduce and study $n$-fibre colourings of labelled digraphs.
These are colourings of the arcs of $D$ such that at each vertex $v$, and for
each colour $\alpha$, $in(v,\alpha)+out(v,\alpha)\leq n$ with $in(v,\alpha)$
the number of arcs coloured $\alpha$ entering $v$ and $out(v,\alpha)$ the
number of labels $l$ such that there is at least one arc of label $l$ leaving
$v$ and coloured with $\alpha$. The problem is to find the minimum number of
colours $\lambda_n(D)$ such that the $m$-labelled digraph $D$ has an $n$-fibre
colouring. In the particular case when $D$ is $1$-labelled, $\lambda_1(D)$ is
called the directed star arboricity of $D$, and is denoted by $dst(D)$. We
first show that $dst(D)\leq 2\Delta^-(D)+1$, and conjecture that if
$\Delta^-(D)\geq 2$, then $dst(D)\leq 2\Delta^-(D)$. We also prove that for a
subcubic digraph $D$, then $dst(D)\leq 3$, and that if $\Delta^+(D),
\Delta^-(D)\leq 2$, then $dst(D)\leq 4$. Finally, we study
$\lambda_n(m,k)=\max\{\lambda_n(D) \tq D \mbox{is $m$-labelled} \et
\Delta^-(D)\leq k\}$. We show that if $m\geq n$, then $\ds
\left\lceil\frac{m}{n}\left\lceil \frac{k}{n}\right\rceil + \frac{k}{n}
\right\rceil\leq \lambda_n(m,k) \leq\left\lceil\frac{m}{n}\left\lceil
\frac{k}{n}\right\rceil + \frac{k}{n} \right\rceil + C \frac{m^2\log k}{n}$ for
some constant $C$. We conjecture that the lower bound should be the right value
of $\lambda_n(m,k)$.
"
What is the relationship between the Ricci curvature and the scalar curvature?,"  In this paper we prove that, under an explicit integral pinching assumption
between the $L^2$-norm of the Ricci curvature and the $L^2$-norm of the scalar
curvature, a closed 3-manifold with positive scalar curvature admits an
Einstein metric with positive curvature. In particular this implies that the
manifold is diffeomorphic to a quotient of ${\Bbb S}^3$.
"
What is the brotherly criterion in sup-interpretations?,"  A sup-interpretation is a tool which provides an upper bound on the size of a
value computed by some symbol of a program. Sup-interpretations have shown
their interest to deal with the complexity of first order functional programs.
For instance, they allow to characterize all the functions bitwise computable
in Alogtime. This paper is an attempt to adapt the framework of
sup-interpretations to a fragment of oriented-object programs, including
distinct encodings of numbers through the use of constructor symbols, loop and
while constructs and non recursive methods with side effects. We give a
criterion, called brotherly criterion, which ensures that each brotherly
program computes objects whose size is polynomially bounded by the inputs
sizes.
"
What is the thermodynamics with medium effects expressed by the dispersion relation of temperature and density-dependent particle mass?,"  The thermodynamics with medium effects expressed by the dispersion relation
of the temperature and density dependent particle mass is studied. Many
previous treatments have been reviewed. A new thermodynamical treatment based
on the equilibrium state is suggested. Employing the quark mass density- and
temperature-dependent model, the discrepancies between our treatment and others
are addressed.
"
What is the relationship between the Cauchy-Riemann-Fueter equation and harmonic spinors of a generalized nonlinear Dirac operator?,"  Properties of the Cauchy-Riemann-Fueter equation for maps between
quaternionic manifolds are studied. Spaces of solutions in case of maps from a
K3-surface to the cotangent bundle of a complex projective space are computed.
A relationship between harmonic spinors of a generalized nonlinear Dirac
operator and solutions of the Cauchy-Riemann-Fueter equation are established.
"
What is the relationship between the entanglement of two qubits and interactions with a control qubit?,"  Simple examples are constructed that show the entanglement of two qubits
being both increased and decreased by interactions on just one of them. One of
the two qubits interacts with a third qubit, a control, that is never entangled
or correlated with either of the two entangled qubits and is never entangled,
but becomes correlated, with the system of those two qubits. The two entangled
qubits do not interact, but their state can change from maximally entangled to
separable or from separable to maximally entangled. Similar changes for the two
qubits are made with a swap operation between one of the qubits and a control;
then there are compensating changes of entanglement that involve the control.
When the entanglement increases, the map that describes the change of the state
of the two entangled qubits is not completely positive. Combination of two
independent interactions that individually give exponential decay of the
entanglement can cause the entanglement to not decay exponentially but,
instead, go to zero at a finite time.
"
What is the astrophysical scenario of the class of GRBs associated with SNe Ib/c?,"  We plan to fit the complete gamma- and X-ray light curves of the long
duration GRB060218, including the prompt emission, in order to clarify the
nature of the progenitors and the astrophysical scenario of the class of GRBs
associated to SNe Ib/c. The initial total energy of the electron-positron
plasma E_{e^\pm}^{tot}=2.32\times 10^{50} erg has a particularly low value
similarly to the other GRBs associated with SNe. For the first time we observe
a baryon loading B=10^{-2} which coincides with the upper limit for the
dynamical stability of the fireshell. The effective CircumBurst Medium (CBM)
density shows a radial dependence n_{cbm} \propto r^{-\alpha} with
1.0<\alpha<1.7 and monotonically decreases from 1 to 10^{-6} particles/cm^3.
Such a behavior is interpreted as due to a fragmentation in the fireshell.
Analogies with the fragmented density and filling factor characterizing Novae
are outlined. The fit presented is particularly significant in view of the
complete data set available for GRB060218 and of the fact that it fulfills the
Amati relation. We fit GRB060218, usually considered as an X-Ray Flash (XRF),
as a ""canonical GRB"" within our theoretical model. The smallest possible black
hole, formed by the gravitational collapse of a neutron star in a binary
system, is consistent with the especially low energetics of the class of GRBs
associated with SNe Ib/c. We give the first evidence for a fragmentation in the
fireshell. Such a fragmentation is crucial in explaining both the unusually
large T_{90} and the consequently inferred abnormal low value of the CBM
effective density.
"
What are the implications of the spontaneous breaking of the R-symmetry in the metastable vacuum in the ISS model?,"  We consider the metastable N=1 QCD model of Intriligator, Seiberg and Shih
(ISS), deformed by adding a baryon term to the superpotential. This simple
deformation causes the spontaneous breaking of the approximate R-symmetry of
the metastable vacuum. We then gauge the flavour SU(5)_f and identify it with
the parent gauge symmetry of the Standard Model (SM). This implements direct
mediation of supersymmetry breaking without the need for an additional
messenger sector. A reasonable choice of parameters leads to gaugino masses of
the right order. Finally, we speculate that the entire ``ISS x SM'' model
should be interpreted as a magnetic dual of an (unknown) asymptotically free
theory.
"
What is the evidence for the presence of large spot complexes on the surface of the star HD 189733?,"  We monitored three transits of the giant gas planet around the nearby K dwarf
HD 189733 with the ACS camera on the Hubble Space Telescope. The resulting
very-high accuracy lightcurve (signal-to-noise ratio near 15000 on individual
measurements, 35000 on 10-minute averages) allows a direct geometric
measurement of the orbital inclination, radius ratio and scale of the system: i
= 85.68 +- 0.04, Rpl/R*=0.1572 +- 0.0004, a/R*=8.92 +- 0.09. We derive improved
values for the stellar and planetary radius, R*=0.755+- 0.011 Rsol, Rpl=1.154
+- 0.017 RJ, and the transit ephemerides, Ttr=2453931.12048 +- 0.00002 + n
2.218581 +- 0.000002$. The HST data also reveal clear evidence of the planet
occulting spots on the surface of the star. At least one large spot complex
(>80000 km) is required to explain the observed flux residuals and their colour
evolution. This feature is compatible in amplitude and phase with the
variability observed simultaneously from the ground. No evidence for satellites
or rings around HD 189733b is seen in the HST lightcurve. This allows us to
exlude with a high probability the presence of Earth-sized moons and
Saturn-type debris rings around this planet. The timing of the three transits
sampled is stable to the level of a few seconds, excluding a massive second
planet in outer 2:1 resonance.
"
What is the Lefschetz property for an algebra?,"  The authors T.Harima, J.C.Migliore, U.Nagel and J.Watanabe characterized the
Hilbert function of algbebras with the Lefschetz property. We extend this
characterization to algebras with the Lefschetz property m times. We also give
upper bounds for the Betti numbers of Artinian algebras with a given Hilbert
function and with the Lefschetz property m times and describe the cases in
which these bounds are reached.
"
What is the Thomas-Fermi approximation used to describe polarized unitary gases in anisotropic harmonic traps?,"  We use Bogoliubov de-Gennes theory to show that the commonly used
Thomas-Fermi approximation (TFA) can fail in describing polarized unitary gases
in anisotropic harmonic traps. We find a magnetized superfluid region inside
the trap, with order parameter oscillations, even though there is no such
stable bulk phase. This leads to magnetization profiles that deviate from
contours of constant potential energy. We determine how this violation scales
with trap anisotropy and number of particles, and show that we are able to
account for important differences between the MIT and Rice experiments.
"
What is the mechanism that drives the periapse collapse in binary star systems?,"  Radial velocity surveys find Jupiter mass planets with semi-major axes a less
than 0.1 AU around ~1% of solar-type stars; counting planets with $a$ as large
as 5 AU, the fraction of stars having planets reaches ~ 10% {Marcy,Butler}. An
examination of the distribution of semi-major axes shows that there is a clear
excess of planets with orbital periods around 3 or 4 days, corresponding to
a~0.03$ AU, with a sharp cutoff at shorter periods (see Figure 1). It is
believed that Jupiter mass planets form at large distances from their parent
stars; some fraction then migrate in to produce the short period objects. We
argue that a significant fraction of the `hot Jupiters' (a<0.1 AU) may arise in
binary star systems in which the orbit of the binary is highly inclined to the
orbit of the planet. Mutual torques between the two orbits drive down the
minimum separation or periapse r_p between the planet and its host star (the
Kozai mechanism). This periapse collapse is halted when tidal friction on the
planet circularizes the orbit faster than Kozai torque can excite it. The same
friction then circularizes the planet orbit, producing hot Jupiters with the
peak of the semimajor axis distribution lying around 3 days. For the observed
distributions of binary separation, eccentricity and mass ratio, roughly 2.5%
of planets with initial semimajor axis a_p ~ 5au will migrate to within 0.1au
of their parent star. Kozai migration could account for 10% or more of the
observed hot Jupiters.
"
What are the physical properties of the helical edge states in HgTe quantum wells?,"  The quantum spin Hall (QSH) effect is the property of a new state of matter
which preserves time-reversal, has an energy gap in the bulk, but has
topologically robust gapless states at the edge. Recently, it has been shown
that HgTe quantum wells realize this novel effect. In this work, we start from
realistic tight-binding models and demonstrate the existence of the helical
edge states in HgTe quantum wells and calculate their physical properties. We
also show that 3d HgTe is a topological insulator under uniaxial strain, and
show that the surface states are described by single-component massless
relativistic Dirac fermions in 2+1 dimensions. Experimental predictions are
made based on the quantitative results obtained from realistic calculations.
"
What are the properties of conditional expectation in PBN?,"  In this paper, we continue to explore the consistence and usability of
Probability Bracket Notation (PBN) proposed in our previous articles. After a
brief review of PBN with dimensional analysis, we investigate probability
spaces in terms of PBN by introducing probability spaces associated with random
variables (R.V) or associated with stochastic processes (S.P). Next, we express
several important properties of conditional expectation (CE) and some their
proofs in PBN. Then, we introduce martingales based on sequence of R.V or based
on filtration in PBN. In the process, we see PBN can be used to investigate
some probability problems, which otherwise might need explicit usage of Measure
theory. Whenever applicable, we use dimensional analysis to validate our
formulas and use graphs for visualization of concepts in PBN. We hope this
study shows that PBN, stimulated by and adapted from Dirac notation in Quantum
Mechanics (QM), may have the potential to be a useful tool in probability
modeling, at least for those who are already familiar with Dirac notation in
QM.
"
What is the influence of soil conductivity on the wide-band pulse waveform?,"  We simulate EM pulse propagation along the nonuniform earth surface using so
called time-domain parabolic equation. To solve it by finite differences, we
introduce a time-domain analog of the impedance boundary condition and a
nonlocal BC of transparency reducing open computational domain to a strip of
finite width. Numerical examples demonstrate influence of soil conductivity on
the wide-band pulse waveform. For a high-frequency modulated EM pulse, we
develop an asymptotic approach based on the ray structure of the monochromatic
wave field at carrier frequency. This radically diminishes the computation
costs and allows for pulsed wave field calculation in vast domains measured by
tens of thousands wavelengths.
"
Is the Tantrix rotation puzzle problem NP-complete or co-NP-complete?,"  Holzer and Holzer (Discrete Applied Mathematics 144(3):345--358, 2004) proved
that the Tantrix(TM) rotation puzzle problem is NP-complete. They also showed
that for infinite rotation puzzles, this problem becomes undecidable. We study
the counting version and the unique version of this problem. We prove that the
satisfiability problem parsimoniously reduces to the Tantrix(TM) rotation
puzzle problem. In particular, this reduction preserves the uniqueness of the
solution, which implies that the unique Tantrix(TM) rotation puzzle problem is
as hard as the unique satisfiability problem, and so is DP-complete under
polynomial-time randomized reductions, where DP is the second level of the

What is the generalization of the Barannikov-Kontsevich construction to higher genera correlators with gravitational descendants?,"  We propose a Hodge field theory construction that captures algebraic
properties of the reduction of Zwiebach invariants to Gromov-Witten invariants.
It generalizes the Barannikov-Kontsevich construction to the case of higher
genera correlators with gravitational descendants.
  We prove the main theorem stating that algebraically defined Hodge field
theory correlators satisfy all tautological relations. From this perspective
the statement that Barannikov-Kontsevich construction provides a solution of
the WDVV equation looks as the simplest particular case of our theorem. Also it
generalizes the particular cases of other low-genera tautological relations
proven in our earlier works; we replace the old technical proofs by a novel
conceptual proof.
"
What is the effect of the Rashba spin-orbit coupling on the spin-valve effect?,"  We study spin-dependent transport in a two-dimensional electron gas subject
to an external step-like potential $V(x)$ and irradiated by an electromagnetic
field (EF). In the absence of EF the electronic spectrum splits into spin
sub-bands originating from the ""Rashba"" spin-orbit coupling. We show that the
resonant interaction of propagating electrons with the component EF parallel to
the barrier induces a \textit{% non-equilibrium dynamic gap} $(2\Delta_{R})$
between the spin sub-bands. Existence of this gap results in coherent spin-flip
processes that lead to a spin-polarized current and a large magnetoresistance,
i.e the spin valve effect. These effects may be used for controlling spin
transport in semiconducting nanostructures, e.g. spin transistors,
spin-blockade devices etc., by variation of the intensity S and frequency
$\omega $ of the external radiation.
"
What is the time needed for a conquering language to become the dominant language in a conquered region?,"  When a region is conquered by people speaking another language, we assume
within the Schulze model that at each iteration each person with probability s
shifts to the conquering language. The time needed for the conquering language
to become dominating is about 2/s for directed Barabasi-Albert networks, but
diverges on the square lattice for decreasing s at some critical value sc
"
What is the fraction of contact binaries in the Trojan asteroids?,"  We present the results of an optical lightcurve survey of 114 Jovian Trojan
asteroids conducted to determine the fraction of contact binaries.
Sparse-sampling was used to assess the photometric range of the asteroids and
those showing the largest ranges were targeted for detailed follow-up
observations. This survey led to the discovery of two Trojan asteroids, (17365)
and (29314) displaying large lightcurve ranges (~1 magnitude) and long rotation
periods (< 2 rotations per day consistent with a contact binary nature. The
optical lightcurves of both asteroids are well matched by Roche binary
equilibrium models. Using these binary models, we find low densities of ~600
kg/m^3 and 800 kg/m^3, suggestive of porous interiors. The fraction of contact
binaries is estimated to be between 6% and 10%, comparable to the fraction in
the Kuiper Belt. The total binary fraction in the Trojan clouds (including both
wide and close pairs) must be higher.
"
What are the properties of Euclidean rhythms in the context of music?,"  We demonstrate relationships between the classic Euclidean algorithm and many
other fields of study, particularly in the context of music and distance
geometry. Specifically, we show how the structure of the Euclidean algorithm
defines a family of rhythms which encompass over forty timelines
(\emph{ostinatos}) from traditional world music. We prove that these
\emph{Euclidean rhythms} have the mathematical property that their onset
patterns are distributed as evenly as possible: they maximize the sum of the
Euclidean distances between all pairs of onsets, viewing onsets as points on a
circle. Indeed, Euclidean rhythms are the unique rhythms that maximize this
notion of \emph{evenness}. We also show that essentially all Euclidean rhythms
are \emph{deep}: each distinct distance between onsets occurs with a unique
multiplicity, and these multiplicies form an interval $1,2,...,k-1$. Finally,
we characterize all deep rhythms, showing that they form a subclass of
generated rhythms, which in turn proves a useful property called shelling. All
of our results for musical rhythms apply equally well to musical scales. In
addition, many of the problems we explore are interesting in their own right as
distance geometry problems on the circle; some of the same problems were
explored by Erd\H{o}s in the plane.
"
What are the leading asymptotics of the ground state energy and the density profile in the Gross-Pitaevskii description of rotating Bose-Einstein condensates?,"  We extend the results of a previous paper on the Gross-Pitaevskii description
of rotating Bose-Einstein condensates in two-dimensional traps to confining
potentials of the form V(r) = r^s, $2<s <\infty$. Writing the coupling constant
as $1/\epsilon^2$ we study the limit $\epsilon \to 0$. We derive rigorously the
leading asymptotics of the ground state energy and the density profile when the
rotation velocity \Omega tends to infinity as a power of $1/\epsilon$. The case
of asymptotically homogeneous potentials is also discussed.
"
What is the relationship between the nucleon density and the mass of the chiral condensate in the framework of AdS/QCD?,"  We study the physics with finite nuclear density in the framework of AdS/QCD
with holographic baryon field included. Based on a mean field type approach, we
introduce the nucleon density as a bi-fermion condensate of the lowest mode of
the baryon field and calculate the density dependence of the chiral condensate
and the nucleon mass. We observe that the chiral condensate as well as the mass
of nucleon decrease with increasing nuclear density. We also consider the mass
splitting of charged vector mesons in iso-spin asymmetric nuclear matter.
"
What are the implications of the low mass-to-light ratio of NGC 57 for our understanding of isolated ellipticals?,"  We present analysis of Chandra and XMM-Newton observations of three
early-type galaxies, NGC 57, NGC 7796 and IC 1531. All three are found in very
low density environments, and appear to have no neighbours of comparable size.
NGC 57 has a halo of kT~0.9 keV, solar metallicity gas, while NGC 7796 and IC
1531 both have ~0.55 keV, 0.5-0.6 Zsol haloes. IC 1531 has a relatively compact
halo, and we consider it likely that gas has been removed from the system by
the effects of AGN heating. For NGC 57 and NGC 7796 we estimate mass, entropy
and cooling time profiles and find that NGC 57 has a fairly massive dark halo
with a mass-to-light ratio of 44.7 (4.0,-8.5) Msol/Lsol (1 sigma uncertainties)
at 4.75 Re. This is very similar to the mass-to-light ratio found for NGC 4555
and confirms that isolated ellipticals can possess sizable dark matter haloes.
We find a significantly lower mass-to-light ratio for NGC 7796, 10.6
(+2.5,-2.3) Msol/Lsol at 5 Re, and discuss the possibility that NGC 7796 hosts
a galactic wind, causing us to underestimate its mass.
"
What are the possible models that could explain the nature of IRS 1A?,"  S140 IRS1 is a remarkable source where the radio source at the center of the
main bipolar molecular outflow in the region is elongated perpendicular to the
axis of the outflow, an orientation opposite to that expected if the radio
source is a thermal jet exciting the outflow. We present results of 1.3 cm
continuum and H2O maser emission observations made with the VLA in its A
configuration toward this region. In addition, we also present results of
continuum observations at 7 mm and re-analyse observations at 2, 3.5 and 6 cm
(previously published). IRS 1A is detected at all wavelengths, showing an
elongated structure. Three water maser spots are detected along the major axis
of the radio source IRS 1A. We have also detected a new continuum source at 3.5
cm (IRS 1C) located ~0.6'' northeast of IRS 1A. The presence of these two YSOs
(IRS 1A and 1C) could explain the existence of the two bipolar molecular
outflows observed in the region. In addition, we have also detected three
continuum clumps (IRS 1B, 1D and 1E) located along the major axis of IRS 1A. We
discuss two possible models to explain the nature of IRS 1A: a thermal jet and
an equatorial wind.
"
What are the phase structures in different regions of the parameter space?,"  In hep-th/0703135, they have found the type IIA intersecting brane
configuration where there exist three NS5-branes, D4-branes and anti-D4-branes.
By analyzing the gravitational interaction for the D4-branes in the background
of the NS5-branes, the phase structures in different regions of the parameter
space were studied in the context of classical string theory. In this paper, by
adding the orientifold 4-plane and 6-plane to the above brane configuration, we
describe the intersecting brane configurations of type IIA string theory
corresponding to the meta-stable nonsupersymmetric vacua of these gauge
theories.
"
What is the model for the time-dependent metagalactic radiation field used to calculate the gamma-ray background?,"  Very high energy gamma-rays from blazars traversing cosmological distances
through the metagalactic radiation field can convert into electron-positron
pairs in photon-photon collisions. The converted gamma-rays initiate
electromagnetic cascades driven by inverse-Compton scattering off the microwave
background photons. Using a model for the time-dependent metagalactic radiation
field consistent with all currently available far-infrared-to-optical data, we
calculate the cascade contribution from faint, unresolved high- and low-peaked
blazars to the extragalactic gamma-ray background as measured by EGRET. For
low-peaked blazars, we adopt a spectral index consistent with the mean spectral
index of EGRET detected blazars, and the luminosity function determined by
Chiang and Mukherjee (1998). For high-peaked blazars, we adopt template spectra
matching prototype sources observed with air-Cherenkov telescopes up to 30 TeV,
and a luminosity function based on X-ray measurements. The low number of about
20 for nearby high-peaked blazars with a flux exceeding 10^-11 cm^-2 s^-1 above
300 GeV inferred from the luminosity function is consistent with the results
from air-Cherenkov telescope observations. Including the cascade emission from
higher redshifts, the total high-peaked blazar contribution to the observed
gamma-ray background at GeV energies can account up to about 30.
"
What is the mathematical model of the Universe expansion that was constructed in this paper?,"  In this paper we first construct a mathematical model for the Universe
expansion that started up with the original Big Bang. Next, we discuss the
problematic of the mechanical and physical laws invariance regarding the
spatial frame exchanges. We then prove the (theoretical) existence of a
variable metric $g_t$, depending on time and satisfying to a simplified
Einstein equation, so that all free ordinary trajectories are geodesics. This
is done by considering the classical Galileo-Newtonian space and time relation,
by using generalized Newtonian principles and adding the approved physical new
ones (as covariance principle, Mach principle, the Einstein equivalence
principle ...) in order to establish a new cosmological model of the dynamical
Universe as being $(U(t))_{t\geq 0}=(B_e(O,t),g_t)_{t\geq 0}$, where $B_e(O,t)$
is the Euclidean ball of radius $t$ in $\mathbb R^3$. The cosmological metric
$g_t$ is totally determined, at time $t$, by the mass energy distribution
$E_t(X)$ on $B_e(O,t)$. We study also the black holes phenomenon and we prove
that the total and global cosmological energy distribution $E_t(X)$ satisfies
to the wave equation whose solutions are characterized by pseudo-frequencies
depending on time and related to the spectrum of the Dirichlet problem on the
unit ball $B_e(O,1)$ for the Laplace-Beltrami operator -$\Delta$. Our model is
consistent in the sense that all Newtonian and classical physical laws are
valid as particular cases in classical situations. Then, we show that all basic
results of Modern Physics are still valid without using the second postulate of
special relativity nor the uncertainty principle.
"
What are the problems of Monte-Carlo modeling of a bundle of fibers?,"  In this work are considered some questions of Monte-Carlo modeling on
nontrivial bundles. As a basic example is used problem of generation of
straight lines in 3D space, related with modeling of interaction of a solid
body with a flux of particles and with some other tasks. Space of lines used in
given model is example of nontrivial fiber bundle, that is equivalent with
tangent sheaf of a sphere.
"
What are the modifications of transition frequencies and linewidth of the elementary oscillators in the diagram series of electromagnetic propagators?,"  We give a microscopic derivation of the Clausius-Mossotti relations for a
homogeneous and isotropic magneto-dielectric medium consisting of radiatively
broadened atomic oscillators. To this end the diagram series of electromagnetic
propagators is calculated exactly for an infinite bi-cubic lattice of
dielectric and magnetic dipoles for a lattice constant small compared to the
resonance wavelength $\lambda$. Modifications of transition frequencies and
linewidth of the elementary oscillators are taken into account in a
selfconsistent way by a proper incorporation of the singular self-interaction
terms. We show that in radiatively broadened media sufficiently close to the
free-space resonance the real part of the index of refraction approaches the
value -2 in the limit of $\rho \lambda^3 \gg 1$, where $\rho$ is the number
density of scatterers. Since at the same time the imaginary part vanishes as
$1/\rho$ local field effects can have important consequences for realizing
low-loss negative index materials.
"
What are the cosets of one-parameter subgroups of a Lie group?,"  In this paper, we study homogeneous geodesics in homogeneous Finsler spaces.
We first give a simple criterion that characterizes geodesic vectors. We show
that the geodesics on a Lie group, relative to a bi-invariant Finsler metric,
are the cosets of the one-parameter subgroups. The existence of infinitely many
homogeneous geodesics on compact semi-simple Lie group is established. We
introduce the notion of naturally reductive homogeneous Finsler space. As a
special case, we study homogeneous geodesics in homogeneous Randers spaces.
Finally, we study some curvature properties of homogeneous geodesics. In
particular, we prove that the S-curvature vanishes along the homogeneous
geodesics.
"
What are the implications of the motion of the Local Sheet away from the Local Void?,"  The peculiar velocity of the Local Group of galaxies manifested in the Cosmic
Microwave Background dipole is found to decompose into three dominant
components. The three components are clearly separated because they arise on
distinct spatial scales and are fortuitously almost orthogonal in their
influences. The nearest, which is distinguished by a velocity discontinuity at
~7 Mpc, arises from the evacuation of the Local Void. We lie in the Local Sheet
that bounds the void. Random motions within the Local Sheet are small. Our
Galaxy participates in the bulk motion of the Local Sheet away from the Local
Void. The component of our motion on an intermediate scale is attributed to the
Virgo Cluster and its surroundings, 17 Mpc away. The third and largest
component is an attraction on scales larger than 3000 km/s and centered near
the direction of the Centaurus Cluster. The amplitudes of the three components
are 259, 185, and 455 km/s, respectively, adding collectively to 631 km/s in
the reference frame of the Local Sheet. Taking the nearby influences into
account causes the residual attributed to large scales to align with observed
concentrations of distant galaxies and reduces somewhat the amplitude of motion
attributed to their pull. On small scales, in addition to the motion of our
Local Sheet away from the Local Void, the nearest adjacent filament, the Leo
Spur, is seen to be moving in a direction that will lead to convergence with
our filament. Finally, a good distance to an isolated galaxy within the Local
Void reveals that this dwarf system has a motion of at least 230 km/s away from
the void center. Given the velocities expected from gravitational instability
theory in the standard cosmological paradigm, the distance to the center of the
Local Void must be at least 23 Mpc from our position. The Local Void is large!
"
What is the experimental signature of local staggered spin correlations in doped Mott insulator superconductors that can be predicted by the doped-carrier theory?,"  We evaluate the doping dependence of the quasiparticle current and low
temperature superfluid density in two slave-particle theories of the tt't''J
model -- the slave-boson theory and doped-carrier theory. In the slave-boson
theory, the nodal quasiparticle current renormalization factor $\alpha$
vanishes proportionally to the zero temperature superfluid density $\rho_S(0)$;
however, we find that away from the $\rho_S(0) \to 0$ limit $\alpha$ displays a
much weaker doping dependence than $\rho_S(0)$. A similar conclusion applies to
the doped-carrier theory, which differentiates the nodal and antinodal regions
of momentum space. Due to its momentum space anisotropy, the doped-carrier
theory enhances the value of $\alpha$ in the hole doped regime, bringing it to
quantitative agreement with experiments, and reproduces the asymmetry between
hole and electron doped cuprate superconductors. Finally, we use the
doped-carrier theory to predict a specific experimental signature of local
staggered spin correlations in doped Mott insulator superconductors which, we
propose, should be observed in STM measurements of underdoped high-Tc
compounds. This experimental signature distinguishes the doped-carrier theory
from other candidate mean-field theories of high-Tc superconductors, like the
slave-boson theory and the conventional BCS theory.
"
What is the agegraphic dark energy model used to accommodate the old galaxies LBDS 53W091 and LBDS 53W069?,"  We investigate the age constraint on the agegraphic dark energy model by
using two old galaxies (LBDS 53W091 and LBDS 53W069) and the old high redshift
quasar APM 08279+5255. We find that the agegraphic dark energy model can easily
accommodate LBDS 53W091 and LBDS 53W069. To accommodate APM 08279+5255, one can
take the reduced Hubble parameter as large as h=0.64, when the fraction matter
energy density $\Omega_{m0}\approx 0.22$.
"
What is the quantum-number projection scheme used in the improved Gaussian-basis Monte Carlo method?,"  We examine Gaussian-basis Monte Carlo method (GBMC) introduced by Corney and
Drummond. This method is based on an expansion of the density-matrix operator
rho by means of the coherent Gaussian-type operator basis Lambda and does not
suffer from the minus sign problem. The original method, however, often fails
in reproducing the true ground state and causes systematic errors of calculated
physical quantities because the samples are often trapped in some metastable or
symmetry broken states. To overcome this difficulty, we combine the
quantum-number projection scheme proposed by Assaad, Werner, Corboz, Gull and
Troyer in conjunction with the importance sampling of the original GBMC method.
This improvement allows us to carry out the importance sampling in the
quantum-number-projected phase-space. Some comparisons with the previous
quantum-number projection scheme indicate that, in our method, the convergence
with the ground state is accelerated, which makes it possible to extend the
applicability and widen the range of tractable parameters in the GBMC method.
The present scheme offers an efficient practical way of computation for
strongly correlated electron systems beyond the range of system sizes,
interaction strengths and lattice structures tractable by other computational
methods such as the quantum Monte Carlo method.

"What is the expression for the limit in equation (\ref{abst}) in terms of the function f, the Gaussian process G, and the Hermite polynomials H_j?","  Let $G=\{G(x),x\ge 0\}$ be a mean zero Gaussian process with stationary
increments and set $\sigma^2(|x-y|)= E(G(x)-G(y))^2$. Let $f$ be a function
with $Ef^{2}(\eta)<\ff$, where $\eta=N(0,1)$. When $\sigma^2$ is regularly
varying at zero and \[
  \lim_{h\to 0}{h^2\over \sigma^2(h)}= 0\qquad {and}\qquad \lim_{h\to
0}{\sigma^2(h)\over h}= 0
  \quad {but} \quad ({d^{2}\over ds^2}\sigma^2(s))^{j_0} \] is locally
integrable for some integer $j_0\ge 1$, and satisfies some additional
regularity conditions, \bea && \int_a^bf(\frac{G(x+h)-G(x)}{\sigma (h)}) dx
\label{abst}\nn &&\qquad = \sum_{j=0}^{j_0} (h/\sigma(h))^{j} {E(H_{j}(\eta)
f(\eta))\over\sqrt {j!}} :(G')^{j}:(I_{[a,b]}) +o({h\over\sigma (h)})^{j_0}\nn
\eea in $L^2$. Here $H_j$ is the $j$-th Hermite polynomial. Also
$:(G')^{j}:(I_{[a,b]})$ is a $j $-th order Wick power Gaussian chaos
constructed from the Gaussian field $ G'(g) $, with covariance \[ E(G'(g)G'(\wt
g)) = \int \int \rho (x-y)g(x)\wt g(y) dx dy\label{3.7bqs}, \] where $
\rho(s)={1/2}{d^{2}\over ds^2}\sigma^2(s)$.
"
How does the Coriolis acceleration impact the balance between prograde and retrograde waves in non-rotating stars?,"  This is the third in a series of papers that deal with angular momentum
transport by internal gravity waves. We concentrate on the waves excited by
core convection in a 3Msun, Pop I main sequence star. Here, we want to examine
the role of the Coriolis acceleration in the equations of motion that describe
the behavior of waves and to evaluate its impact on angular momentum transport.
We use the so-called traditional approximation of geophysics, which allows
variable separation in radial and horizontal components. In the presence of
rotation, the horizontal structure is described by Hough functions instead of
spherical harmonics. The Coriolis acceleration has two main effects on waves.
It transforms pure gravity waves into gravito-inertial waves that have a larger
amplitude closer to the equator, and it introduces new waves whose restoring
force is mainly the conservation of vorticity. Taking the Coriolis acceleration
into account changes the subtle balance between prograde and retrograde waves
in non-rotating stars. It also introduces new types of waves that are either
purely prograde or retrograde. We show in this paper where the local deposition
of angular momentum by such waves is important.
"
What are the conditions under which temperature and velocity oscillations can be observed in a Rayleigh-Bernard convection cell?,"  Temperature and velocity oscillations have been found in a rectangular
Rayleigh-B\'{e}nard convection cell, in which one large scale convection roll
exists. At $Ra=8.9 \times 10^{11}$ and $Pr=4$, temperature oscillation can be
observed in most part of the system and the oscillation period remains almost
constant, $t_T = 74 \pm 2$ seconds. Velocity oscillation can only be found in
its horizontal component, $v_y$ (perpendicular to large scale circulation
plane), near the cell sidewall, its oscillation period is also constant, $t_T =
65 \pm 2$ seconds, at these positions. Temperature and velocity oscillations
have different Ra dependence, which are respectively indicated by Peclect
number $Pe_T = 0.55Ra^{0.47}$ and $Pe_v = 0.28Ra^{0.50}$ . In comparison to the
case of cylindrical cell, we find that the velocity oscillation is affected by
the system geometry.
"
What are the implications of a distributed software experiment for the Internet's self-awareness?,"  When will the Internet become aware of itself? In this note the problem is
approached by asking an alternative question: Can the Internet cope with
stress? By extrapolating the psychological difference between coping and
defense mechanisms a distributed software experiment is outlined which could
reject the hypothesis that the Internet is not a conscious entity.
"
What is the model for crystallization and melting temperatures?,"  We present a simple unifying model for crystallization and melting
temperatures by showing that homogeneous nucleation and phase transformations
driven by thickening of pre-existing surface layers are limiting conditions of
the more general heterogeneous nucleation case. Furthermore, to a first
approximation all these processes can be described by an extended classical
nucleation theory. The model can also be applied to phase transition
temperatures in confined volumes, provided reliable values for the interfacial
tensions within the systems are determinable. The expected melting and
crystallization temperature for any transformation pathway can then be
predicted.
"
What is the relationship between the Laplace density and the Riemann zeta-function?,"  An odd meromorphic function f(s) is constructed from the Riemann
zeta-function evaluated at one-half plus s. We determine the two-sided Laplace
transform representation of f(s) on open vertical strips, V'(4w), disjoint from
the (translated) critical strip. V'(4w) consists of all s with real part,
Re(s), of absolute value greater than one-half and Re(s) between successive
poles 4w, 4(w + 1) of f(s), with w an integer. The corresponding Laplace
density is related to confluent hypergeometric functions. That density is shown
to be positive for nonzero w other than -1. Those results are obtained without
relying on any unproven hypothesis. They are used together with the Riemann
hypothesis and hypotheses advanced by the author to obtain conditional results
concerning the zeta-function. Those results are presented in Part I. Their
proofs are derived in Parts III-V. A metric geometry expression of the
positivity of the Laplace densities arising is established in Part VI.
"
Is the energy of the Universe decreasing linearly with time?,"  It is conjectured that time intervals of any kind are proportional to the age
of the Universe taken at the time we are considering the interval. If this is
the case then the speed of light, in fact any speed, must decrease inversely
proportional to this age. The immediate consequence is that energy is not
conserved: the hypothesis that time is a homogeneous property implies
conservation of energy (the theorem of Noether). Nonconservation of energy
follows from the condition that any time interval is proportional to the
cosmological time, and therefore time can not be homogeneous. From the
uncertainty principle, taking the constant of Planck as a real constant, time
independent, it follows that any energy in the Universe decreases linearly with
time. We then prove that Schroedinger equation does not change, except for the
potential energy term. The future of the Universe gives for the wave functions
a long sinusoidal spatial solution, so that everything becomes unlocalized. The
relativistic absolute interval remains the same, even with a changing speed of
light, and the Universe turns out to be nonexpanding. A Mass-Boom effect is
confirmed.
"
What is the impact of the gluon density uncertainty in diffractive parton densities?,"  With the knowledge of diffractive parton densities extracted from HERA data,
we discuss the observation of exclusive events using the dijet mass fraction as
measured by the CDF collaboration at the Tevatron. In particular the impact of
the gluon density uncertainty is analysed. Some prospects are given for
diffractive physics at the LHC.
"
What are the results of the iterated Bing doubles of algebraically slice knots?,"  We introduce a new technique for showing classical knots and links are not
slice. As one application we resolve a long-standing question as to whether
certain natural families of knots contain topologically slice knots. We also
present a simpler proof of the result of Cochran-Teichner that the successive
quotients of the integral terms of the Cochran-Orr-Teichner filtration of the
knot concordance group have rank 1. For links we have similar results. We show
that the iterated Bing doubles of many algebraically slice knots are not
topologically slice. Some of the proofs do not use the existence of the
Cheeger-Gromov bound, a deep analytical tool used by Cochran-Teichner. Our main
examples are actually boundary links but cannot be detected in the algebraic
boundary link concordance group, nor by any $\rho$ invariants associated to
solvable representations into finite unitary groups.
"
What is the shape of the He I profiles compared to H-alpha or [N II] profiles?,"  We present the first high-dispersion spectroscopy of He I 10830 from the
hotspots in the ring around SN1987A, obtained at Gemini South, spatially
resolving the near and far sides of the ring. We compare these line profiles to
similar echelle spectra of H$\alpha$ and [N II] 6583 obtained at the Magellan
Observatory. We find that the He I profiles are much broader than H-alpha or [N
II], but the He I profiles also have different shapes -- they have enhanced
emission at high speeds, with extra blueshifted emission on the north side of
the ring, and extra redshifted emission on the south side. To explain this, we
invoke a simple geometric picture where the extra He I emission traces hotter
gas from faster shocks that strike the apex of the hotspots directly, while the
H-alpha preferentially traces cooler lower-ionization gas from slower
transverse shocks that penetrate into the sides of the ring.
"
What are the implications of the Yang-Mills theory for the lattice data?,"  We give a comparison of the spectrum of Yang-Mills theory in $D=3+1$,
recently derived with a strong coupling expansion, with lattice data. We verify
excellent agreement also for 2$^{++}$ glueball. A deep analogy with the $D=2+1$
case is obtained and a full quantum theory of this approach is also given.
"
"What are the implications of the results for the study of CP violation, Lorentz structure, and chirality structure of the charged current weak interactions?","  In this paper, we indicate the theoretical possibility of using the decay of
polarized muons at rest as a source of the transversely polarized electron
antineutrino beam. Such a beam can be used to probe new effects beyond standard
model. We mean here new tests concerning CP violation, Lorentz structure and
chirality structure of the charged current weak interactions. The main goal is
to show how the energy and angular distribution of the electron antineutrinos
in the muon rest frame depends on the transverse components of the antineutrino
beam polarization. Our analysis is model-independent and consistent with the
current upper limits on the non-standard couplings. The results are presented
in a limit of infinitesimally small mass for all particles produced in the
decay.
"
What is the closed form for the emptiness formation probability of the open XXZ chain?,"  This paper is devoted to the study of the emptiness formation probability
$\tau\pa{m}$ of the open XXZ chain. We derive a closed form for $\tau\pa{m}$ at
$\Delta=\tf{1}{2}$ when the boundary field vanishes. Moreover we obtain its
leading asymptotics for an arbitrary boundary field at the free fermion point.
Finally, we compute the first term of the asymptotics of $\ln\pa{\tau\pa{m}}$
in the whole massless regime $-1<\Delta<1$.
"
What is the dynamical behavior of boson/boson and boson/antiboson pairs?,"  We extend our previous studies of head-on collisions of boson stars by
considering orbiting binary boson stars. We concentrate on equal mass binaries
and study the dynamical behavior of boson/boson and boson/antiboson pairs. We
examine the gravitational wave output of these binaries and compare with other
compact binaries. Such a comparison lets us probe the apparent simplicity
observed in gravitational waves produced by black hole binary systems. In our
system of interest however, there is an additional internal freedom which plays
a significant role in the system's dynamics, namely the phase of each star. Our
evolutions show rather simple behavior at early times, but large differences
occur at late times for the various initial configurations.
"
What are the CP violation parameter beta_eff measured by the BaBar detector at SLAC?,"  We analyze the decay B0 --> K+ K- K0 using 383 million B-Bbar events
collected by the BaBar detector at SLAC to extract CP violation parameter
values over the Dalitz plot. Combining all K+ K- K0 events, we find A_CP =
-0.015 +/- 0.077 +/- 0.053 and beta_eff = 0.352 +/- 0.076 +/- 0.026 rad,
corresponding to a CP violation significance of 4.8 sigma. A second solution
near pi/2 - beta_eff is disfavored with a significance of 4.5 sigma. We also
report A_CP and beta_eff separately for decays to phi(1020) K0, f0(980) K0, and
K+ K- K0 with m_{K+ K-} > 1.1 GeV/c^2.
"
What is the main idea of Kontsevich's proof of the existence of deformation quantization of Poisson manifolds?,"  First three sections of this overview paper cover classical topics of
deformation theory of associative algebras and necessary background material.
We then analyze algebraic structures of the Hochschild cohomology and describe
the relation between deformations and solutions of the corresponding
Maurer-Cartan equation. In Section 6 we generalize the Maurer-Cartan equation
to strongly homotopy Lie algebras and prove the homotopy invariance of the
moduli space of solutions of this equation. In the last section we indicate the
main ideas of Kontsevich's proof of the existence of deformation quantization
of Poisson manifolds.
"
What is the relationship between the Floquet and Perron eigenvalues in the context of age-structured systems of equations?,"  For monotone linear differential systems with periodic coefficients, the
(first) Floquet eigenvalue measures the growth rate of the system. We define an
appropriate arithmetico-geometric time average of the coefficients for which we
can prove that the Perron eigenvalue is smaller than the Floquet eigenvalue. We
apply this method to Partial Differential Equations, and we use it for an
age-structured systems of equations for the cell cycle. This opposition between
Floquet and Perron eigenvalues models the loss of circadian rhythms by cancer
cells.
"
What is the path integral of the Poisson sigma model on sphere?,"  We evaluate the path integral of the Poisson sigma model on sphere and study
the correlators of quantum observables. We argue that for the path integral to
be well-defined the corresponding
  Poisson structure should be unimodular. The construction of the finite
dimensional BV theory is presented and we argue that it is responsible for the
leading semiclassical contribution. For a (twisted) generalized Kahler manifold
we discuss the gauge fixed action for the Poisson sigma model. Using the
localization we prove that for the holomorphic Poisson structure the
semiclassical result for the correlators is indeed the full quantum result.
"
What are the groups of manipulators classified in the three-revolute orthogonal manipulators?,"  This paper analyses the workspace of the three-revolute orthogonal
manipulators that have at least one of their DH parameters equal to zero. These
manipulators are classified into different groups with similar kinematic
properties. The classification criteria are based on the topology of the
workspace. Each group is evaluated according to interesting kinematic
properties such as the size of the workspace subregion reachable with four
inverse kinematic solutions, the existence and the size of voids, and the size
of the regions of feasible paths in the workspace.
"
What is the curvature of geodesics flow in the FRW universe?,"  We consider dynamics of the FRW Universe with a scalar field. Using
Maupertuis principle we find a curvature of geodesics flow and show that zones
of positive curvature exist for all considered types of scalar field potential.
Usually, phase space of systems with the positive curvature contains islands of
regular motion. We find these islands numerically for shallow scalar field
potentials. It is shown also that beyond the physical domain the islands of
regularity exist for quadratic potentials as well.
"
What is the condition on the initial state for the ancilla-assisted entanglement rate?,"  We discuss upper bounds on the rate at which unitary evolution governed by a
non-local Hamiltonian can generate entanglement in a bipartite system. Given a
bipartite Hamiltonian H coupling two finite dimensional particles A and B, the
entangling rate is shown to be upper bounded by c*log(d)*norm(H), where d is
the smallest dimension of the interacting particles, norm(H) is the operator
norm of H, and c is a constant close to 1. Under certain restrictions on the
initial state we prove analogous upper bound for the ancilla-assisted
entangling rate with a constant c that does not depend upon dimensions of local
ancillas. The restriction is that the initial state has at most two distinct
Schmidt coefficients (each coefficient may have arbitrarily large
multiplicity). Our proof is based on analysis of a mixing rate -- a functional
measuring how fast entropy can be produced if one mixes a time-independent
state with a state evolving unitarily.
"
What is the normalizer of a diffuse amenable subalgebra of a free group factor $L(\Bbb F_r)$?,"  We prove that the normalizer of any diffuse amenable subalgebra of a free
group factor $L(\Bbb F_r)$ generates an amenable von Neumann subalgebra.
Moreover, any II$_1$ factor of the form $Q \vt L(\Bbb F_r) $, with $Q$ an
arbitrary subfactor of a tensor product of free group factors, has no Cartan
subalgebras. We also prove that if a free ergodic measure preserving action of
a free group $\Bbb F_r$, $2\leq r \leq \infty$, on a probability space
$(X,\mu)$ is profinite then the group measure space factor $L^\infty(X)\rtimes
\Bbb F_r$ has unique Cartan subalgebra, up to unitary conjugacy.
"
What is the phase shift induced by Au clusters as a function of the cluster size?,"  Electron holography in a transmission electron microscope was applied to
measure the phase shift induced by Au clusters as a function of the cluster
size. Large phase shifts Df observed for small Au clusters cannot be described
by the well-known equation Df=C_E V_0 t (C_E: interaction constant, V_0: mean
inner Coulomb potential (MIP) of bulk gold, t: cluster thickness). The rapid
increase of the Au MIP with decreasing cluster size derived from Df, can be
explained by the compressive strain of surface atoms in the cluster.
"
"What is the two-field inflation scenario in the warped conifold background, and how does it differ from the single-field description?","  We study D-brane inflation in a warped conifold background that includes
brane-position dependent corrections for the nonperturbative superpotential.
Instead of stabilizing the volume modulus chi at instantaneous minima of the
potential and studying the inflation dynamics with an effective single field
(radial distance between a brane and an anti-brane) phi, we investigate the
multi-field inflation scenario involving these two fields. The two-field
dynamics with the potential V(phi,chi) in this model is significantly different
from the effective single-field description in terms of the field phi when the
field chi is integrated out. The latter picture underestimates the total number
of e-foldings even by one order of magnitude. We show that a correct
single-field description is provided by a field psi obtained from a rotation in
the two-field space along the background trajectory. This model can give a
large number of e-foldings required to solve flatness and horizon problems at
the expense of fine-tunings of model parameters. We also estimate the spectra
of density perturbations and show that the slow-roll parameter eta_{psi
psi}=M_{pl}^2 V_{,psi psi}/V in terms of the rotated field psi determines the
spectral index of scalar metric perturbations. We find that it is generally
difficult to satisfy, simultaneously, both constraints of the spectral index
and the COBE normalization, while the tensor to scalar ratio is sufficiently
small to match with observations.
"
What are the results of PSD studies performed on small dimensions in the Counting Test Facility?,"  Pulse shape discrimination (PSD) is one of the most distinctive features of
liquid scintillators. Since the introduction of the scintillation techniques in
the field of particle detection, many studies have been carried out to
characterize intrinsic properties of the most common liquid scintillator
mixtures in this respect. Several application methods and algorithms able to
achieve optimum discrimination performances have been developed. However, the
vast majority of these studies have been performed on samples of small
dimensions. The Counting Test Facility, prototype of the solar neutrino
experiment Borexino, as a 4 ton spherical scintillation detector immersed in
1000 tons of shielding water, represents a unique opportunity to extend the
small-sample PSD studies to a large-volume setup. Specifically, in this work we
consider two different liquid scintillation mixtures employed in CTF,
illustrating for both the PSD characterization results obtained either with the
processing of the scintillation waveform through the optimum Gatti's method, or
via a more conventional approach based on the charge content of the
scintillation tail. The outcomes of this study, while interesting per se, are
also of paramount importance in view of the expected Borexino detector
performances, where PSD will be an essential tool in the framework of the
background rejection strategy needed to achieve the required sensitivity to the
solar neutrino signals.
"
What is the effect of spin-orbit interaction on the maximum of the specific heat C(T) in the case of crystalline bismuth?,"  In recent years, there has been increasing interest in the specific heat $C$
of insulators and semiconductors because of the availability of samples with
different isotopic masses and the possibility of performing \textit{ab initio}
calculations of its temperature dependence $C(T)$ using as a starting point the
electronic band structure. Most of the crystals investigated are elemental
(e.g., germanium) or binary (e.g., gallium nitride) semiconductors. The initial
electronic calculations were performed in the local density approximation and
did not include spin-orbit interaction. Agreement between experimental and
calculated results was usually found to be good, except for crystals containing
heavy atoms (e.g., PbS) for which discrepancies of the order of 20% existed at
the low temperature maximum found for $C/T^3$. It has been conjectured that
this discrepancies result from the neglect of spin-orbit interaction which is
large for heavy atoms ($\Delta_0\sim$1.3eV for the $p$ valence electrons of
atomic lead). Here we discuss measurements and \textit{ab initio} calculations
of $C(T)$ for crystalline bismuth ($\Delta_0\sim$1.7 eV), strictly speaking a
semimetal but in the temperature region accessible to us ($T >$ 2K) acting as a
semiconductor. We extend experimental data available in the literature and
notice that the \textit{ab initio} calculations without spin-orbit interaction
exhibit a maximum at $\sim$8K, about 20% lower than the measured one. Inclusion
of spin-orbit interaction decreases the discrepancy markedly: The maximum of
$C(T)$ is now only 7% larger than the measured one. Exact agreement is obtained
if the spin-orbit hamiltonian is reduced by a factor of $\sim$0.8.
"
What are the invariant quantities of spatial rotations and Lorentz transformations?,"  The ordered addition of two Lorentz boosts is normally shown to result in a
boost by utilizing concepts from group theory and non-Euclidian geometry. We
present a method for achieving this addition by performing a sequence of
spatial rotations and uni-dimensional Lorentz transformations. The method is
first developed for two-dimensional space and it is then extended to
three-dimensional space by utilizing the commutative property of the rotation
of the y-z plane and a boost along the x-axis. The method employs only matrix
multiplication and certain invariant quantities that are natural consequences
of spatial rotations and Lorentz transformations. The combining of two boosts
in different directions into a single boost cannot be expected a priori because
we show that the converse of this statement is not true. That is, two rotations
interspersed with a boost cannot always be reduced to a single rotation
preceded and followed by boosts.
"
How can the sexagesimal system be adopted starting from the knowledge of the facts exposed in this article and from the knowledge of the astronomical data?,"  This paper presents a simple geometrical fact which could relate to the
history of mathematics and astronomy. This fact shows a natural link between
the circle and the multiples of 6 and it makes it possible to obtain a simple
representation of the 12 months of the year, the 24 hours of the day, the 30
days (average number) of the month and the 360 days (approximate number) of the
year, which brings us closer to the sexagesimal division of time. Moreover this
representation reminds one of the movement of the planets around a centre.
Using this fact one will be able also to find geometrically the principal
divisor of number 60, to represent numbers in base 60 with a kind of abacus or
calculation table and to make a division of the circle into 6 and 12 equal
parts. Afterwards one will be able to obtain a division in 360 unequal parts
but relatively close to one another, and the goal isn't precisely to obtain an
optimal division of the circle in 360 equal parts but to prove that the idea to
divide the circle in 360 equal parts can subsequently be suggested by these
geometrical facts that have been showed. In this article the author will not
answer the following questions: a) What is the origin of the sexagesimal
system? b) By which way could one manage to adopt the sexagesimal system
starting from the knowledge of the facts exposed in this article and starting
from the knowledge of the astronomical data? These questions could be treated,
using information of this article, by the readers or later on by the author.
"
What is the tight-binding approximation of the nonlinear Schrödinger equation with a periodic linear potential and periodic in space nonlinearity coefficient?,"  It is shown that the tight-binding approximation of the nonlinear
Schr\""odinger equation with a periodic linear potential and periodic in space
nonlinearity coefficient gives rise to a number of nonlinear lattices with
complex, both linear and nonlinear, neighbor interactions. The obtained
lattices present non-standard possibilities, among which we mention a
quasi-linear regime, where the pulse dynamics obeys essentially the linear
Schr{\""o}dinger equation. We analyze the properties of such models both in
connection with their modulational stability, as well as in regard to the
existence and stability of their localized solitary wave solutions.
"
What is the Euler adic transformation with root of unity?,"  We introduce a family of adic transformations on diagrams that are
nonstationary and nonsimple. This family includes some previously studied adic
transformations. We relate the dimension group of each these diagrams to the
dynamical system determined by the adic transformation on the infinite edge
paths, and we explicitly compute the dimension group for a subfamily. We also
determine the ergodic adic invariant probability measures for this subfamily,
and show that each system of the subfamily is loosely Bernoulli. We also give
examples of particular adic transformations with roots of unity as well as one
which is totally ergodic called the Euler adic. We also show that the Euler
adic is loosely Bernoulli.
"
What is the mapping class group of the closed non-orientable surface of genus 4?,"  Finite presentations for the mapping class group M(F) are known for arbitrary
orientable compact surface F. If F is non-orientable, then such presentations
are known only when F has genus at most 3 and few boundary components. In this
paper we obtain finite presentation for the mapping class group of the closed
non-orientable surface of genus 4 from its action on the so called ordered
complex of curves.
"
What are the limitations of the VLTI instrument in terms of spectral resolution?,"  We present here the current performances of the AMBER / VLTI instrument for
standard use and compare these with the offered modes of the instrument. We
show that the instrument is able to reach its specified precision only for
medium and high spectral resolution modes, differential observables and bright
objects. For absolute observables, the current achievable accuracy is strongly
limited by the vibrations of the Unit Telescopes, and also by the observing
procedure which does not take into account the night-long transfer function
monitoring. For low-resolution mode, the current limitation is more in the data
reduction side, since several effects negligible at medium spectral resolution
are not taken into account in the current pipeline. Finally, for faint objects
(SNR around 1 per spectral channel), electromagnetic interferences in the VLTI
interferometric laboratory with the detector electronics prevents currently to
get unbiased measurements. Ideas are under study to correct in the data
processing side this effect, but a hardware fix should be investigated
seriously since it limits seriously the effective limiting magnitude of the
instrument.
"
What parameters determine the applicability of the method?,"  Applicability of anisotropic flow measurement techniques and their extension
for detectors with non-uniform azimuthal acceptance are discussed. Considering
anisotropic flow measurement with two and three (mixed harmonic) azimuthal
correlations we introduce a set of observables based on the x and y components
of the event flow vector. These observables provide independent measures of
anisotropic flow, and can be used to test self-consistency of the analysis.
Based on these observables we propose a technique that explicitly takes into
account the effects of non-uniform detector acceptance. Within this approach
the acceptance corrections, as well as parameters which define the method
applicability, can be determined directly from experimental data. For practical
purposes a brief summary of the method is provided at the end.
"
What are the implications of the lightest components of the 5-Higgs for the symmetry of the universe?,"  The six Higgs doublet model is a minimal extension of the Standard Model that
addresses dark matter and gauge coupling unification. Another Higgs doublet in
a 5 representation of a discrete symmetry group, such as S_6, is added to the
SM. The lightest components of the 5-Higgs are neutral, stable and serve as
dark matter so long as the discrete symmetry is not broken. Direct and indirect
detection signals, as well as collider signatures are discussed. The five-fold
multiplicity of the dark matter decreases its mass and typically helps make the
dark matter more visible in upcoming experiments.
"
What are the implications of the Thomsen semigroup for the classification of Hilbert modules?,"  Building on work of Elliott and coworkers, we present three applications of
the Cuntz semigroup: (i) for many simple C$^*$-algebras, the Thomsen semigroup
is recovered functorially from the Elliott invariant, and this yields a new
proof of Elliott's classification theorem for simple, unital AI algebras; (ii)
for the algebras in (i), classification of their Hilbert modules is similar to
the von Neumann algebra context; (iii) for the algebras in (i), approximate
unitary equivalence of self-adjoint operators is characterised in terms of the
Elliott invariant.
"
What are the estimates of the effective interface models?,"  We provide accurate Monte Carlo results for the free energy of interfaces
with periodic boundary conditions in the 3D Ising model. We study a large range
of inverse temperatures, allowing to control corrections to scaling. In
addition to square interfaces, we study rectangular interfaces for a large
range of aspect ratios u=L_1/L_2. Our numerical results are compared with
predictions of effective interface models. This comparison verifies clearly the
effective Nambu-Goto model up to two-loop order. Our data also allow us to
obtain the estimates T_c sigma^-1/2=1.235(2), m_0++ sigma^-1/2=3.037(16) and
R_+=f_+^2 sigma_0 =0.387(2), which are more precise than previous ones.
"
What is the relationship between a group of automorphisms of K and the group K?,"  Let $K$ be a compact metrizable group and $\Ga$ be a group of automorphisms
of $K$. We first show that each $\ap \in \Ga$ is distal on $K$ implies $\Ga$
itself is distal on $K$, a local to global correspondence provided $\Ga$ is a
generalized $\ov{FC}$-group or $K$ is a connected finite-dimensional group. We
show that $\Ga$ contains an ergodic automorphism when $\Ga$ is nilpotent and
ergodic on a connected finite-dimensional compact abelian group $K$.
"
What are the elastic moduli anomalies observed in a single crystal of YMnO3?,"  We report an ultrasonic investigation of the elastic moduli on a single
crystal of hexagonal YMnO_3 as a function of temperature. Stiffening anomalies
in the antiferromagnetic N\'eel state below T_N = 72.4 K are observed on all
the four elastic moduli C_{ii}. The anomalies are the most important on C_{11}
and C_{66} for in-plane elastic deformations; this is consistent with a strong
coupling of the lattice with the in-plane exchange interactions. We use a
Landau free energy model to account for these elastic anomalies. We derive an
expression which relates the temperature profile of the anomaly to the order
parameter; the critical exponent associated to this parameter $\beta$ = 0.42 is
not consistent with a chiral XY or 3D Heisenberg universality class, but more
in agreement with a conventional antiferromagnetic long range order. A tiny
softening anomaly on C_{11} for which hysteresis effects are observed could be
indicative of an interaction between ferroelectric and magnetic domains at T_N.
Moreover, magnetic fluctuations effects both above and below T_N are identified
through abnormal temperature and magnetic field effects.
"
What are the symplectic orbifolds that are symplectically fillable by a smooth manifold?,"  In this paper we present a method to obtain resolutions of symplectic
orbifolds arising from symplectic reduction of a Hamiltonian S^1-manifold at a
regular value. As an application, we show that all isolated cyclic
singularities of a symplectic orbifold admit a resolution and that
pre-quantisations of symplectic orbifolds are symplectically fillable by a
smooth manifold.
"
"What is the formula for the obstructions to deform a class in H^q(X, Omega_X^p)?","  Let $X$ be a compact complex manifold, consider a small deformation $\phi:
\mathcal{X} \to B$ of $X$, the dimension of the Dolbeault cohomology groups
$H^q(X_t,\Omega_{X_t}^p)$ may vary under this defromation. This paper will
study such phenomenons by studying the obstructions to deform a class in
$H^q(X,\Omega_X^p)$ with the parameter $t$ and get the formula for the
obstructions.
"
What are the implications of the two-fold symmetry between partitions of the universal genetic code?,"  This letter reports complete sets of two-fold symmetries between partitions
of the universal genetic code. By substituting bases at each position of the
codons according to a fixed rule, it happens that properties of the degeneracy
pattern or of tRNA aminoacylation specificity are exchanged.
"
What are the filling fraction of the metal f that determines the position of the plasmon modes of these metamaterials?,"  The dielectric properties of metamaterials consisting of periodically
arranged metallic nanoparticles of spherical shape are calculated by rigorously
solving Maxwell's equations. Effective dielectric functions are obtained by
comparing the reflectivity of planar surfaces limiting these materials with
Fresnel's formulas for equivalent homogeneous media, showing mixing and
splitting of individual-particle modes due to inter-particle interaction.
Detailed results for simple cubic and fcc crystals of aluminum spheres in
vacuum, silver spheres in vacuum, and silver spheres in a silicon matrix are
presented. The filling fraction of the metal f is shown to determine the
position of the plasmon modes of these metamaterials. Significant deviations
are observed with respect to Maxwell-Garnett effective medium theory for large
f, and multiple plasmons are predicted to exist in contrast to Maxwell-Garnett
theory.
"
What is the role of introducing a fifth large-scale space-time dimension to the equations of orbital dynamics?,"  The effect of introducing a fifth large-scale space-time dimension to the
equations of orbital dynamics was analysed in an earlier paper by the authors.
The results showed good agreement with the observed flat rotation curves of
galaxies and the Pioneer Anomaly. This analysis did not require the
modification of Newtonian dynamics, but rather only their restatement in a five
dimensional framework. The same analysis derived a acceleration parameter ar,
which plays an important role in the restated equations of orbital dynamics,
and suggested a value for ar. In this companion paper, the principle of
conservation of energy is restated within the same five-dimensional framework.
The resulting analysis provides an alternative route to estimating the value of
ar, without reference to the equations of orbital dynamics, and based solely on
key cosmological constants and parameters, including the gravitational
constant, G. The same analysis suggests that: (i) the inverse square law of
gravity may itself be due to the conservation of energy at the boundary between
a four-dimensional universe and a fifth large-scale space-time dimension; and
(ii) there is a limiting case for the Tulley-Fisher relationship linking the
speed of light to the mass of the Universe.
"
What is the behavior of SiS in the photodissociation in the outer part of the circumstellar envelope?,"  New SiS multi-transition (sub-)millimetre line observations of a sample of
AGB stars with varying photospheric C/O-ratios and mass-loss rates are
presented. A combination of low- and high-energy lines are important in
constraining the circumstellar distribution of SiS molecules. A detailed
radiative transfer modelling of the observed SiS line emission is performed,
including the effect of thermal dust grains in the excitation analysis. We find
that the circumstellar fractional abundance of SiS in these environments has a
strong dependence on the photospheric C/O-ratio as expected from chemical
models. The carbon stars (C/O>1) have a mean fractional abundance of 3.1E-6,
about an order of magnitude higher than found for the M-type AGB stars (C/O<1)
where the mean value is 2.7E-7. These numbers are in reasonable agreement with
photospheric LTE chemical models. SiS appears to behave similar to SiO in terms
of photodissociation in the outer part of the circumstellar envelope. In
contrast to previous results for the related molecule SiO, there is no strong
correlation of the fractional abundance with density in the CSE, as would be
the case if freeze-out onto dust grains were important. However, possible
time-variability of the line emission in the lower J transitions and the
sensitivity of the line emission to abundance gradients in the inner part of
the CSE may mask a correlation with the density of the wind. There are
indications that the SiS fractional abundance could be significantly higher
closer to the star which, at least in the case of M-type AGB stars, would
require non-equilibrium chemical processes.
"
What are the band structures of zig-zag nanotubes for R/l > 1 and B > 10 T?,"  We develop a long wavelength approximation in order to describe the
low-energy states of carbon nanotubes in a transverse magnetic field. We show
that, in the limit where the square of the magnetic length $l = \sqrt{\hbar c
/e B}$ is much larger than the $C$-$C$ distance times the nanotube radius $R$,
the low-energy theory is given by the linear coupling of a two-component Dirac
spinor to the corresponding vector potential. We investigate in this regime the
evolution of the band structure of zig-zag nanotubes for values of $R/l > 1$,
showing that for radius $R \approx 20$ nm a clear pattern of Landau levels
start to develop for magnetic field strength $B \gtrsim 10$ T. The levels tend
to be four-fold degenerate, and we clarify the transition to the typical
two-fold degeneracy of graphene as the nanotube is unrolled to form a curved
strip. We show that the dynamics of the Dirac fermions leads to states which
are localized at the flanks of the nanotube and that carry chiral currents in
the longitudinal direction. We discuss the possibility to observe the
quantization of the Hall conductivity in thick carbon nanotubes, which should
display steps at even multiples of $2 e^2/h$, with values doubled with respect
to those in the odd-integer quantization of graphene.
"
What are the results extended to the case of non-adjacent covariates?,"  Bairamov et al. (Aust N Z J Stat 47:543-547, 2005) characterize the
exponential distribution in terms of the regression of a function of a record
value with its adjacent record values as covariates. We extend these results to
the case of non-adjacent covariates. We also consider a more general setting
involving monotone transformations. As special cases, we present
characterizations involving weighted arithmetic, geometric, and harmonic means.
"
What is the main result of the KaLYPSO project?,"  A comprehensive picture of high-mass star formation has remained elusive, in
part because examples of high-mass YSOs tend to be relatively distant, deeply
embedded, and confused with other emission sources. These factors have impeded
dynamical investigations within tens of AU of high-mass YSOs--scales that are
critical for probing the interfaces where outflows from accretion disks are
launched and collimated. Using observations of SiO masers obtained with the VLA
and the VLBA, the KaLYPSO project is overcoming these limitations by mapping
the structure and dynamical/temporal evolution of the material 10-1000 AU from
the nearest high-mass YSO: Radio Source I in the Orion BN/KL region. Our data
include ~40 epochs of VLBA observations over a several-year period, allowing us
to track the proper motions of individual SiO maser spots and to monitor
changes in the physical conditions of the emitting material with time.
Ultimately these data will provide 3-D maps of the outflow structure over
approximately 30% of the outflow crossing time. Here we summarize recent
results from the KaLYPSO project, including evidence that high-mass star
formation is occurring via disk-mediated accretion.
"
What is the relationship between the smallness of the neutrino mass-squared-difference ratio and the neutrino mixing angle?,"  The smallness of the 1-3 lepton mixing angle $\theta_{13}$ and of the
neutrino mass-squared-difference ratio $\Delta m^2_{12}/\Delta m^2_{23}$ can be
understood as the departure from a common limit where they both vanish. We
discuss in general the conditions for realizing the mass degeneracy of a pair
of neutrinos and show that the vanishing of a CP violating phase is needed. We
find that the discrete quaternion group Q of eight elements is the simplest
family symmetry which correlates the smallness of $\Delta m^2_{12}$ to the
value of $\theta_{13}$. In such a model we predict $0.12\lesssim
\sin\theta_{13} \lesssim 0.2$ if the ordering of the neutrino mass spectrum is
normal, and $\sin\theta_{13}\lesssim 0.12$ if it is inverted.
"
What are the various approaches to trend testing in reliability data bases?,"  We review basic modeling approaches for failure and maintenance data from
repairable systems. In particular we consider imperfect repair models, defined
in terms of virtual age processes, and the trend-renewal process which extends
the nonhomogeneous Poisson process and the renewal process. In the case where
several systems of the same kind are observed, we show how observed covariates
and unobserved heterogeneity can be included in the models. We also consider
various approaches to trend testing. Modern reliability data bases usually
contain information on the type of failure, the type of maintenance and so
forth in addition to the failure times themselves. Basing our work on recent
literature we present a framework where the observed events are modeled as
marked point processes, with marks labeling the types of events. Throughout the
paper the emphasis is more on modeling than on statistical inference.
"
What is the Sturm-Liouville problem with two self-adjoint boundary conditions?,"  We consider a regular indefinite Sturm-Liouville problem with two
self-adjoint boundary conditions affinely dependent on the eigenparameter. We
give sufficient conditions under which the root vectors of this Sturm-Liouville
problem can be selected to form a Riesz basis of a corresponding weighted
Hilbert space.
"
What are the covariantization of the flat space result in AdS?,"  We apply a recently presented BRST procedure to construct the Largangian
cubic vertex of higher-spin gauge field triplets interacting with massive free
scalars. In flat space, the spin-s triplet propagates the series of irreducible
spin-s, s-2,..,0/1 modes which couple independently to corresponding conserved
currents constructed from the scalars. The simple covariantization of the flat
space result is not enough in AdS, as new interaction vertices appear. We
present in detail the cases of spin-2 and spin-3 triplets coupled to scalars.
Restricting to a single irreducible spin-s mode we uncover previously obtained
results. We also present an alternative derivation of the lower spin results
based on the idea that higher-spin gauge fields arise from the gauging of
higher derivative symmetries of free matter Lagrangians. Our results can be
readily applied to holographic studies of higher-spin gauge theories.
"
What is the veto method used to eliminate certain classes of instrumental glitches in GW detectors?,"  We present a robust strategy to \emph{veto} certain classes of instrumental
glitches that appear at the output of interferometric gravitational-wave (GW)
detectors.This veto method is `physical' in the sense that, in order to veto a
burst trigger, we make use of our knowledge of the coupling of different
detector subsystems to the main detector output. The main idea behind this
method is that the noise in an instrumental channel X can be \emph{transferred}
to the detector output (channel H) using the \emph{transfer function} from X to
H, provided the noise coupling is \emph{linear} and the transfer function is
\emph{unique}. If a non-stationarity in channel H is causally related to one in
channel X, the two have to be consistent with the transfer function. We
formulate two methods for testing the consistency between the burst triggers in
channel X and channel H. One method makes use of the \emph{null-stream}
constructed from channel H and the \emph{transferred} channel X, and the second
involves cross-correlating the two. We demonstrate the efficiency of the veto
by `injecting' instrumental glitches in the hardware of the GEO 600 detector.
The \emph{veto safety} is demonstrated by performing GW-like hardware
injections. We also show an example application of this method using 5 days of
data from the fifth science run of GEO 600. The method is found to have very
high veto efficiency with a very low accidental veto rate.
"
What is the effect of interactions within a generic perturbative scheme?,"  Adiabatic quantum pumping in noninteracting, phase coherent quantum dots is
elegantly described by Brouwer's formula. Interactions within the dot, while
suppressing phase coherence, make Brouwer's formalism inapplicable. In this
paper, we discuss the nature of the physical processes forcing a description of
pumping beyond Brouwer's formula, and develop, using a controlled adiabatic
expansion, a useful formalism to study the effect of interactions within a
generic perturbative scheme. The pumped current consists of a first
contribution, analogous to Brouwer's formula and accounting for the remanent
coherence, and of interaction corrections describing inelastic scattering. We
apply the formalism to study the effect of interaction with a bosonic bath on a
resonant level pump and discuss the robustness of the quantization of the
pumped charge in turnstile cycles.
"
What is the equation of state that includes the photodisintegration of helium?,"  We investigate the properties and evolution of accretion tori formed after
the coalescence of two compact objects. At these extreme densities and
temperatures, the accreting torus is cooled mainly by neutrino emission
produced primarily by electron and positron capture on nucleons (beta
reactions). We solve for the disc structure and its time evolution by
introducing a detailed treatment of the equation of state which includes
photodisintegration of helium, the condition of beta-equilibrium, and neutrino
opacities. We self-consistently calculate the chemical equilibrium in the gas
consisting of helium, free protons, neutrons and electron-positron pairs and
compute the chemical potentials of the species, as well as the electron
fraction throughout the disc. We find that, for sufficiently large accretion
rates (> 10 solar masses per second), the inner regions of the disk become
opaque and develop a viscous and thermal instability. The identification of
this instability might be relevant for GRB observations.
"
What are the main ingredients for a self-consistent theoretical modeling of the solar chromosphere?,"  Spectral diagnostic features formed in the solar chromosphere are few and
difficult to interpret -- they are neither formed in the optically thin regime
nor in local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE). To probe the state of the
chromosphere, both from observations and theory, it is therefore necessary with
modeling. I discuss both traditional semi-empirical modeling, numerical
experiments illustrating important ingredients necessary for a self-consistent
theoretical modeling of the solar chromosphere and the first results of such
models.
"
What are the implications of the results of the comparisons for the understanding of the physics of jet and multijet production?,"  Forward jet and multijet production has been measured at low Bjorken x at
HERA. The measured cross sections and correlations were compared to predictions
from DGLAP-based fixed-order calculations. Further comparisons were made to
DGLAP-based and CCFM-based leading-order Monte Carlo predictions, as well as to
Colour-Dipole model predictions. For the majority of the phase space covered in
the HERA kinematic region, fixed-order calculations describe the data well,
while the leading-order models provide an inconsistent description of the data.
"
What are the parameters of the spin Hamiltonian for the copying machine?,"  We present a scheme that transform 1 qubit to M identical copies with optimal
fidedelity via free dynamical evolution of spin star networks. We show that the
Heisenberg XXZ coupling can fulfill the challenge. The initial state of the
copying machine and the parameters of the spin Hamiltonian are discussed in
detail. Furthermore we have proposed a feasible method to prepare the initial
state of the copying machine.
"
What are the constraints on the corrections to the gravitational potential in negative and positive powers of distance?,"  It has been shown that generalized Einstein-Aether theories may lead to
significant modifications to the non-relativistic limit of the Einstein
equations. In this paper we study the effect of a general class of such
theories on the Solar System. We consider corrections to the gravitational
potential in negative and positive powers of distance from the source. Using
measurements of the perihelion shift of Mercury and time delay of radar signals
to Cassini, we place constraints on these corrections. We find that a subclass
of generalized Einstein-Aether theories are compatible with these constraints.
"
What is the relationship between the temperature dependence of the resistivity and the Hall angle in electron-doped superconductors?,"  We measure the resistivity and Hall angle of the electron-doped
superconductor Pr_{2-x}Ce_xCuO_4 as a function of doping and temperature. The
resistivity Rho_xx at temperatures 100K < T < 300K is mostly sensitive to the
electrons. Its temperature behavior is doping independent over a wide doping
range and even for non superconducting samples. On the other hand,the
transverse resistivity rho_xy, or the Hall angle theta_H where cot(theta_H) =
rho_xx/rho_xy, is sensitive to both holes and electrons. Its temperature
dependence is strongly influenced by doping, and cot(theta_H) can be used to
identify optimum doping (the maximum Tc) even well above the critical
temperature. These results lead to a conclusion that in electron doped cuprates
holes are responsible for the superconductivity.
"
What is the implication of the enhanced number of carbon stars in the outer arms of the galaxy M33?,"  In an earlier study of the spiral galaxy M33, we photometrically identified
arcs or outer spiral arms of intermediate age (0.6 Gyr - 2 Gyr) carbon stars
precisely at the commencement of the HI-warp. Stars in the arcs were
unresolved, but were likely thermally-pulsing asymptotic giant branch carbon
stars. Here we present Keck I spectroscopy of seven intrinsically bright and
red target stars in the outer, northern arc in M33. The target stars have
estimated visual magnitudes as faint as V \sim 25 mag. Absorption bands of CN
are seen in all seven spectra reported here, confirming their carbon star
status. In addition, we present Keck II spectra of a small area 0.5 degree away
from the centre of M33; the target stars there are also identified as carbon
stars. We also study the non-stellar PAH dust morphology of M33 secured using
IRAC on board the Spitzer Space Telescope. The Spitzer 8 micron image attests
to a change of spiral phase at the start of the HI warp. The Keck spectra
confirm that carbon stars may safely be identified on the basis of their red
J-K_s colours in the outer, low metallicity disk of M33. We propose that the
enhanced number of carbon stars in the outer arms are an indicator of recent
star formation, fueled by gas accretion from the HI-warp reservoir.
"
What are the classifications of configurations of rigid collections of saddle connections?,"  Configurations of rigid collections of saddle connections are connected
component invariants for strata of the moduli space of quadratic differentials.
They have been classified for strata of Abelian differentials by Eskin, Masur
and Zorich. Similar work for strata of quadratic differentials has been done in
Masur and Zorich, although in that case the connected components were not
distinguished. We classify the configurations for quadratic differentials on
the Riemann sphere and on hyperelliptic connected components of the moduli
space of quadratic differentials. We show that, in genera greater than five,
any configuration that appears in the hyperelliptic connected component of a
stratum also appears in the non-hyperelliptic one.
"
What is the relationship between the set of pure quantum states and the phase space?,"  I sketch how the set of pure quantum states forms a phase space, and then
point out a curiousity concerning maximally entangled pure states: they form a
minimal Lagrangian submanifold of the set of all pure states. I suggest that
this curiousity should have an interesting physical interpretation.
"
What is the significance of the Galactic warp in the context of the Milky Way?,"  We perform a critical re-analysis and discussion of recent results presented
in the literature which interpret the CMa overdensity as the signature of an
accreting dwarf galaxy or a new substructure within the Galaxy. Several issues
are addressed. We show that arguments against the ``warp'' interpretation are
based on an erroneous perception of the Milky Way. There is nothing anomalous
with colour--magnitude diagrams on opposite sides of the average warp mid-plane
being different. We witnessed the rise and fall of the blue plume population,
first attributed to young stars in a disrupting dwarf galaxy and now discarded
as a normal disc population. Similarly, there is nothing anomalous in the outer
thin+thick disc metallicities being low (-1<[Fe/H]<-0.5), and spiral arms (as
part of the thin disc) should, and do, warp. Most importantly, we show
unambiguously that, contrary to previous claims, the warp produces a stellar
overdensity that is distance-compatible with that observed in CMa.The CMa
over-density remains fully accounted for in a first order approach by Galactic
models without new substructures. Given the intrinsic uncertainties (concerning
the properties of the warp, flare and disc cutoff, the role of extinction and
degeneracy), minor deviations with respect to these models are not enough to
support the hypothesis of an accreted dwarf galaxy or new substructure within
the Milky Way disc.
"
What are the properties of the magnetosonic critical curve in the context of self-similar MHD for a non-rotating polytropic gas?,"  In broad astrophysical contexts of large-scale gravitational collapses and
outflows and as a basis for various further astrophysical applications, we
formulate and investigate a theoretical problem of self-similar MHD for a
non-rotating polytropic gas of quasi-spherical symmetry permeated by a
completely random magnetic field. We derive two coupled nonlinear MHD ordinary
differential equations (ODEs), examine properties of the magnetosonic critical
curve, obtain various asymptotic and global semi-complete similarity MHD
solutions, and qualify the applicability of our results. Unique to a magnetized
gas cloud, a novel asymptotic MHD solution for a collapsing core is
established. Physically, the similarity MHD inflow towards the central dense
core proceeds in characteristic manners before the gas material eventually
encounters a strong radiating MHD shock upon impact onto the central compact
object. Sufficiently far away from the central core region enshrouded by such
an MHD shock, we derive regular asymptotic behaviours. We study asymptotic
solution behaviours in the vicinity of the magnetosonic critical curve.
Numerically, we construct global semi-complete similarity MHD solutions that
cross the magnetosonic critical curve zero, one, and two times. For comparison,
counterpart solutions in the case of an isothermal unmagnetized and magnetized
gas flows are demonstrated in the present MHD framework at nearly isothermal
and weakly magnetized conditions. For a polytropic index $\gamma=1.25$ or a
strong magnetic field, different solution behaviours emerge. In these cases,
there exist semi-complete similarity solutions crossing the magnetosonic
critical curve only once, and the MHD counterpart of expansion-wave collapse
solution disappears.
"
What are the implications of the unification of gravitational and weak interactions in the Standard Model?,"  The coupling of chiral fermions to gravity makes use only of the selfdual
SU(2) subalgebra of the (complexified) SO(3,1) algebra. It is possible to
identify the antiselfdual subalgebra with the SU(2)_L isospin group that
appears in the Standard Model, or with its right-handed counterpart SU(2)_R
that appears in some extensions. Based on this observation, we describe a form
of unification of the gravitational and weak interactions. We also discuss
models with fermions of both chiralities, the inclusion strong interactions,
and the way in which these unified models of gravitational and gauge
interactions avoid conflict with the Coleman-Mandula theorem.
"
What is the goal of the HMMER-STRUCT algorithm?,"  Motivation: Profile hidden Markov Models (pHMMs) are a popular and very
useful tool in the detection of the remote homologue protein families.
Unfortunately, their performance is not always satisfactory when proteins are
in the 'twilight zone'. We present HMMER-STRUCT, a model construction algorithm
and tool that tries to improve pHMM performance by using structural information
while training pHMMs. As a first step, HMMER-STRUCT constructs a set of pHMMs.
Each pHMM is constructed by weighting each residue in an aligned protein
according to a specific structural property of the residue. Properties used
were primary, secondary and tertiary structures, accessibility and packing.
HMMER-STRUCT then prioritizes the results by voting. Results: We used the SCOP
database to perform our experiments. Throughout, we apply leave-one-family-out
cross-validation over protein superfamilies. First, we used the MAMMOTH-mult
structural aligner to align the training set proteins. Then, we performed two
sets of experiments. In a first experiment, we compared structure weighted
models against standard pHMMs and against each other. In a second experiment,
we compared the voting model against individual pHMMs. We compare method
performance through ROC curves and through Precision/Recall curves, and assess
significance through the paired two tailed t-test. Our results show significant
performance improvements of all structurally weighted models over default
HMMER, and a significant improvement in sensitivity of the combined models over
both the original model and the structurally weighted models.
"
What is the relationship between quantum behavior and classical behavior in the universe?,"  Two recent studies have presented new information relevant to the transition
from quantum behavior to classical behavior, and related this to parameters
characterizing the universe as a whole. The present study based on a separate
approach has developed similar results that appear to substantiate aspects of
earlier work and also to introduce further new ideas.
"
What is the role of the first-order differential operations in space R^3?,"  In this paper we consider successive iterations of the first-order
differential operations in space ${\bf R}^3.$
"
What are the conditions for the spontaneous symmetry breaking of a gauge theory in higher dimensions?,"  We examine gauge theories defined in higher dimensions where theextra
dimensions form a fuzzy (finite matrix) manifold. First we reinterpret these
gauge theories as four-dimensional theories with Kaluza-Klein modes and then we
perform a generalized \`a la Forgacs-Manton dimensional reduction. We emphasize
some striking features emerging in the later case such as (i) the appearance of
non-abelian gauge theories in four dimensions starting from an abelian gauge
theory in higher dimensions, (ii) the fact that the spontaneous symmetry
breaking of the theory takes place entirely in the extra dimensions and (iii)
the renormalizability of the theory both in higher as well as in four
dimensions. Then reversing the above approach we present a renormalizable four
dimensional SU(N) gauge theory with a suitable multiplet of scalar fields,
which via spontaneous symmetry breaking dynamically develops extra dimensions
in the form of a fuzzy sphere. We explicitly find the tower of massive
Kaluza-Klein modes consistent with an interpretation as gauge theory on $M^4
\times S^2$, the scalars being interpreted as gauge fields on $S^2$. Depending
on the parameters of the model the low-energy gauge group can be of the form
$SU(n_1) \times SU(n_2) \times U(1)$.
"
What are the generalizations to the iterated logarithm for $U$-statistics in Hilbert spaces?,"  We give necessary and sufficient conditions for the (bounded) law of the
iterated logarithm for $U$-statistics in Hilbert spaces. As a tool we also
develop moment and tail estimates for canonical Hilbert-space valued
$U$-statistics of arbitrary order, which are of independent interest.
"
What is the photovoltage technique used to measure in ferromagnetic microstrips?,"  Long time photometric monitoring programs of gravitational lens systems are
often carried on using modest equipment. The resolution of such observations is
limited and some of the images may remain unresolved. It may be still possible
to find a full set of time delays from such a blended data. We discuss here a
particular but interesting case when we have two light curves that both are
blends. A suitable computational algorithm is developed and tested to work with
computer-generated model light curves. Our method combines both blended
sequences using the hypothetical time delays between the initial components of
the light curves as free input parameters. The combined curves are then
compared using statistical distance estimation. It occurs that using an
assumption of equal magnification ratios between the components of the blends,
we can indeed recover the whole set of time delays.
"
of its symmetry and holomorphic properties?,"  We give a reformulation of a six-parameter family of coupled Painlev\'e VI
systems with affine Weyl group symmetry of type $D_6^{(1)}$ from the viewpoint
of its symmetry and holomorphy properties.
"
What are the bolometric temperatures and luminosities of the two compact continuum sources SMA 1 and SMA 2?,"  We present multi-wavelength, high spatial resolution imaging of the IRS 7
region in the R Corona Australis molecular cloud. Our observations include 1.1
mm continuum and HCO^+ J = $3 \to 2$ images from the SMA, ^{12}CO J = $3 \to 2$
outflow maps from the DesertStar heterodyne array receiver on the HHT, 450
$\mu$m and 850 $\mu$m continuum images from SCUBA, and archival Spitzer IRAC
and MIPS 24 \micron images. The accurate astrometry of the IRAC images allow us
to identify IRS 7 with the cm source VLA 10W (IRS 7A) and the X-ray source X_W.
The SMA 1.1 mm image reveals two compact continuum sources which are also
distinguishable at 450 $\mu$m. SMA 1 coincides with X-ray source CXOU
J190156.4-365728 and VLA cm source 10E (IRS 7B) and is seen in the IRAC and
MIPS images. SMA 2 has no infrared counterpart but coincides with cm source VLA
9. Spectral energy distributions constructed from SMA, SCUBA and Spitzer data
yield bolometric temperatures of 83 K for SMA 1 and $\leq$70 K for SMA 2. These
temperatures along with the submillimeter to total luminosity ratios indicate
that SMA 2 is a Class 0 protostar, while SMA 1 is a Class 0/Class I
transitional object (L=$17\pm6$ \Lsun). The ^{12}CO J = $3 \to 2$ outflow map
shows one major and possibly several smaller outflows centered on the IRS 7
region, with masses and energetics consistent with previous work. We identify
the Class 0 source SMA 2/VLA 9 as the main driver of this outflow. The complex
and clumpy spatial and velocity distribution of the HCO^+ J = $3 \to 2$
emission is not consistent with either bulk rotation, or any known molecular
outflow activity.
"
What is the fundamental plane in the relation between a supermassive black hole and its host galaxy?,"  We study observed correlations between supermassive black hole (BHs) and the
properties of their host galaxies, and show that the observations define a BH
'fundamental plane' (BHFP), of the form M_BH sigma^(3.0+-0.3)*R_e^(0.43+-0.19),
or M_BH M_bulge^(0.54+-0.17)*sigma^(2.2+-0.5), analogous to the FP of
elliptical galaxies. The BHFP is preferred over a simple relation between M_BH
and any of sigma, M_bulge, M_dyn, or R_e alone at >99.9% significance. The
existence of this BHFP has important implications for the formation of
supermassive BHs and the masses of the very largest black holes, and
immediately resolves several apparent conflicts between the BH masses expected
and measured for outliers in both the M_BH-sigma and M_BH-M_bulge relations.
"
"What is the size, shape, and excitation energy of a Bose-Einstein condensate as a function of the disorder strength?","  A Bose-Einstein condensate in an external potential consisting of a
superposition of a harmonic and a random potential is considered theoretically.
  From a semi-quantitative analysis we find the size, shape and excitation
energy as a function of the disorder strength. For positive scattering length
and sufficiently strong disorder the condensate decays into fragments each of
the size of the Larkin length ${\cal L}$. This state is stable over a large
range of particle numbers. The frequency of the breathing mode scales as
$1/{\cal L}^2$. For negative scattering length a condensate of size ${\cal L}$
may exist as a metastable state. These finding are generalized to anisotropic
traps.
"
"What are the scenarios that allow the calculation of g_string, g_X, and G_SM's Kac-Moody levels?","  We devise minimalistic gauged U(1)_X Froggatt-Nielsen models which at
low-energy give rise to the recently suggested discrete gauge Z_6 symmetry,
proton hexality, thus stabilizing the proton. Assuming three generations of
right-handed neutrinos, with the proper choice of X-charges, we obtain viable
neutrino masses. Furthermore, we find scenarios such that no X-charged hidden
sector superfields are needed, which from a bottom-up perspective allows the
calculation of g_string, g_X and G_SM's Kac-Moody levels. The only mass scale
apart from M_grav is m_soft.
"
What is the effect of the cosmological constant term on the flux in the early Universe?,"  A destabilization in the transfer energy flux from the vacuum to radiation,
for two vacuum decay laws relevant to the dark energy problem, is analyzed
using the Landau-Lifshitz fluctuation hydrodynamic theory. Assuming thermal (or
near thermal) equilibrium between the vacuum and radiation, at the earliest
epoch of the Universe expansion, we show that the law due to
renormalization-group running of the cosmological constant term, with
parameters chosen not to spoil the primordial nucleosynthesis scenario, does
soon drive the flux to fluctuate beyond its statistical average value thereby
distorting the cosmic background radiation spectrum beyond observational
limits. While the law coming from the saturated holographic dark energy does
not lead the flux to wildly fluctuate, a more realistic non--saturated form
shows again such anomalous behavior.
"
What is the closeness between the equation of motion for a perturbation in the flow and the metric of an analogue acoustic black hole?,"  Spherically symmetric transonic accretion of a fractal medium has been
studied in both the stationary and the dynamic regimes. The stationary
transonic solution is greatly sensitive to infinitesimal deviations in the
outer boundary condition, but the flow becomes transonic and stable, when its
evolution is followed through time. The evolution towards transonicity is more
pronounced for a fractal medium than what is it for a continuum. The dynamic
approach also shows that there is a remarkable closeness between an equation of
motion for a perturbation in the flow, and the metric of an analogue acoustic
black hole. The stationary inflow solutions of a fractal medium are as much
stable under the influence of linearised perturbations, as they are for the
fluid continuum.
"
What are the implications of eternal inflation in the low energy region of the noncommutative spacetime?,"  We investigate the condition for eternal inflation to take place in the
noncommutative spacetime. We find that the possibility for eternal inflation's
happening is greatly suppressed in this case. If eternal inflation cannot
happen in the low energy region where the noncommutativity is very weak (the UV
region), it will never happen during the whole inflationary history. Based on
these conclusions, we argue that an initial condition for eternal inflation is
available from the property of spacetime noncommutativity.
"
What is the geometric interpretation of Planck's constant in the context of quantum mechanics?,"  Quantum mechanics is formulated as a geometric theory on a Hilbert manifold.
Images of charts on the manifold are allowed to belong to arbitrary Hilbert
spaces of functions including spaces of generalized functions. Tensor equations
in this setting, also called functional tensor equations, describe families of
functional equations on various Hilbert spaces of functions. The principle of
functional relativity is introduced which states that quantum theory is indeed
a functional tensor theory, i.e., it can be described by functional tensor
equations. The main equations of quantum theory are shown to be compatible with
the principle of functional relativity. By accepting the principle as a
hypothesis, we then analyze the origin of physical dimensions, provide a
geometric interpretation of Planck's constant, and find a simple interpretation
of the two-slit experiment and the process of measurement.
"
What is the temperature dependence of the mode energies and line intensities of the T1 and T2 modes?,"  Using far-infrared spectroscopy we have studied the magnetic field and
temperature dependence of the spin gap modes in the chains of
Sr$_{14}$Cu$_{24}$O$_{41}$. Two triplet modes T$_1$ and T$_2$ were found in the
center of the Brillouin zone at $\Delta_1=9.65$ meV and $\Delta_2=10.86$ meV in
zero magnetic field. The T$_1$ mode was excited when the electric field vector
${\bf E}$ of the light was polarized along the b axis (perpendicular to the
planes of chains and ladders) and T$_2$ was excited for ${\bf E}\parallel {\bf
a}$ (perpendicular to the chains and along the rungs). Up to the maximum
magnetic field of 18 T, applied along the chains, the electron $g$ factors of
these two modes were similar, $g_{1c}=2.049$ and $g_{2c}=2.044$. Full linewidth
at half maximum for both modes was 1 cm$^{-1}$ (0.12 meV) at 4K and increased
with $T$. The temperature dependence of mode energies and line intensities was
in agreement with the inelastic neutron scattering results from two groups
[Matsuda {\it et al.}, Phys. Rev. B {\bf 59}, 1060 (1999) and Regnault {\it et
al.}, Phys. Rev. B {\bf 59}, 1055 (1999)]. The T$_1$ mode has not been observed
by inelastic neutron scattering in the points of the $k$-space equivalent to
the center of the Brillouin zone. Our study indicates that the zone structure
model of magnetic excitations of Sr$_{14}$Cu$_{24}$O$_{41}$ must be modified to
include a triplet mode at 9.65 meV in the center of the magnetic Brillouin
zone.
"
What is the result of the quantum process tomography of the teleportation algorithm?,"  The performance of a quantum teleportation algorithm implemented on an ion
trap quantum computer is investigated. First the algorithm is analyzed in terms
of the teleportation fidelity of six input states evenly distributed over the
Bloch sphere. Furthermore, a quantum process tomography of the teleportation
algorithm is carried out which provides almost complete knowledge about the
algorithm.
"
What is the role of intrinsic spectral index distribution (ISID) in determining the spectral shape of the unresolved blazar contribution to the diffuse extragalactic gamma-ray background?,"  The intrinsic distribution of spectral indices in GeV energies of
gamma-ray--loud blazars is a critical input in determining the spectral shape
of the unresolved blazar contribution to the diffuse extragalactic gamma-ray
background, as well as an important test of blazar emission theories. We
present a maximum-likelihood method of determining the intrinsic spectral index
distribution (ISID) of a population of gamma-ray emitters which accounts for
error in measurement of individual spectral indices, and we apply it to EGRET
blazars. We find that the most likely Gaussian ISID for EGRET blazars has a
mean of 2.27 and a standard deviation of 0.20. We additionally find some
indication that FSRQs and BL Lacs may have different ISIDs (with BL Lacs being
harder). We also test for spectral index hardening associated with blazar
variability for which we find no evidence. Finally, we produce simulated GLAST
spectral index datasets and perform the same analyses. With improved statistics
due to the much larger number of resolvable blazars, GLAST data will help us
determine the ISIDs with much improved accuracy. Should any difference exist
between the ISIDs of BL Lacs and FSRQs or between the ISIDs of blazars in the
quiescent and flaring states, GLAST data will be adequate to separate these
ISIDs at a significance better than 3 sigma.
"
What are the conditions for the consistency of the group Lasso under practical assumptions?,"  We consider the least-square regression problem with regularization by a
block 1-norm, i.e., a sum of Euclidean norms over spaces of dimensions larger
than one. This problem, referred to as the group Lasso, extends the usual
regularization by the 1-norm where all spaces have dimension one, where it is
commonly referred to as the Lasso. In this paper, we study the asymptotic model
consistency of the group Lasso. We derive necessary and sufficient conditions
for the consistency of group Lasso under practical assumptions, such as model
misspecification. When the linear predictors and Euclidean norms are replaced
by functions and reproducing kernel Hilbert norms, the problem is usually
referred to as multiple kernel learning and is commonly used for learning from
heterogeneous data sources and for non linear variable selection. Using tools
from functional analysis, and in particular covariance operators, we extend the
consistency results to this infinite dimensional case and also propose an
adaptive scheme to obtain a consistent model estimate, even when the necessary
condition required for the non adaptive scheme is not satisfied.
"
What is the process of integrating diverse and heterogeneous data into a unified format in the context of data warehousing?,"  In a data warehousing process, mastering the data preparation phase allows
substantial gains in terms of time and performance when performing
multidimensional analysis or using data mining algorithms. Furthermore, a data
warehouse can require external data. The web is a prevalent data source in this
context. In this paper, we propose a modeling process for integrating diverse
and heterogeneous (so-called multiform) data into a unified format.
Furthermore, the very schema definition provides first-rate metadata in our
data warehousing context. At the conceptual level, a complex object is
represented in UML. Our logical model is an XML schema that can be described
with a DTD or the XML-Schema language. Eventually, we have designed a Java
prototype that transforms our multiform input data into XML documents
representing our physical model. Then, the XML documents we obtain are mapped
into a relational database we view as an ODS (Operational Data Storage), whose
content will have to be re-modeled in a multidimensional way to allow its
storage in a star schema-based warehouse and, later, its analysis.
"
What are the implications of the common-proper motion of the systems containing very low-mass components for the understanding of low-mass star and brown-dwarf formation scenarios?,"  The results of the Koenigstuhl survey in the Southern Hemisphere are
presented. I have searched for common-proper motion companions to 173 field
very low-mass stars and brown dwarfs with spectral types > M5.0V and magnitudes
J <= 14.5 mag. I have measured for the first time the common-proper motion of
two new wide systems containing very low-mass components, Koenigstuhl 2 AB and
3 A-BC. Together with Koenigstuhl 1 AB and 2M0126-50AB, they are among the
widest systems in their respective classes (r = 450-11900 AU). Koenigstuhl 3
A-BC contains a well-known F8V star and a M8.0+L3.0V tight binary. I have
determined the minimum frequency of field wide multiples (r > 100 AU) with
late-type components at 5.0+/-1.8 % and the frequency of field wide late-type
binaries with mass ratios q > 0.5 at 1.2+/-0.9 %. These values represent a key
diagnostic of evolution history and low-mass star and brown-dwarf formation
scenarios. Additionally, the proper motions of 76 field very low-mass dwarfs
are measured here for the first time.
"
What are the implications of the spin-orbit form for the relativistic flux tube model?,"  We generalize the relativistic flux tube model for arbitrary two- or
three-body systems. The spin-independent and spin-dependent contributions of
the flux tube to the total Hamiltonian are computed in perturbation. In
particular, we show that the spin-dependent part exhibits a universal
spin-orbit form: It does not depend on the nature of the confined particles.
The general equations we present, being well-defined for light particles, can
thus be applied to usual as well as exotic hadrons such as hybrid mesons and
glueballs.
"
"What are the implications of the variation of fundamental constants for atomic, molecular, and nuclear physics?","  Review of recent works devoted to the variation of the fundamental constants
is presented including atomic clocks, quasar absorption spectra, and Oklo
natural nuclear reactor data. Assuming linear variation with time we can
compare different results. From the quasar absorption spectra:
  $\dot{\mu}/\mu=(1 \pm 3) \times 10^{-16}$ yr$^{-1}$. A combination of this
result and the atomic clock results gives the best limt on variation of
$\alpha$: $\dot{\alpha}/\alpha=(-0.8 \pm 0.8) \times 10^{-16}$ yr$^{-1}$. The
Oklo natural reactor gives the best limit on the variation of
$m_s/\Lambda_{QCD}$ where $m_s$ is the strange quark mass.
  Huge enhancement of the relative variation effects happens in transitions
between close atomic, molecular and nuclear energy levels. We suggest several
new cases where the levels are very narrow. Large enhancement of the variation
effects is also possible in cold atomic and molecular collisions near Feshbach
resonance. Massive bodies (stars or galaxies) can also affect physical
constants. They have large scalar charge $S$ proportional to number of
particles which produces a Coulomb-like scalar field $U=S/r$. This leads to a
variation of the fundamental constants proportional to the gravitational
potential, e.g. $\delta \alpha/ \alpha = k_\alpha \delta (GM/ r c^2)$. We
compare different manifestations of this effect.The strongest limit
  $k_\alpha +0.17 k_e= (-3.5\pm 6) \times 10^{-7}$.
"
What are the Riemann-Lagrange geometry used to construct in the sense of d-torsions?,"  The aim of this paper is to construct a Riemann-Lagrange geometry on 1-jet
spaces, in the sense of d-connections, d-torsions, d-curvatures,
electromagnetic d-field and geometric electromagnetic Yang-Mills energy,
starting from a given linear ODEs system or a given superior order ODE. The
case of a non-homogenous linear ODE of superior order is disscused.
"
What is the running time and sampling complexity of the algorithm that solves the noisy sorting without re-sampling problem?,"  In this paper we study noisy sorting without re-sampling. In this problem
there is an unknown order $a_{\pi(1)} < ... < a_{\pi(n)}$ where $\pi$ is a
permutation on $n$ elements. The input is the status of $n \choose 2$ queries
of the form $q(a_i,x_j)$, where $q(a_i,a_j) = +$ with probability at least
$1/2+\ga$ if $\pi(i) > \pi(j)$ for all pairs $i \neq j$, where $\ga > 0$ is a
constant and $q(a_i,a_j) = -q(a_j,a_i)$ for all $i$ and $j$. It is assumed that
the errors are independent. Given the status of the queries the goal is to find
the maximum likelihood order. In other words, the goal is find a permutation
$\sigma$ that minimizes the number of pairs $\sigma(i) > \sigma(j)$ where
$q(\sigma(i),\sigma(j)) = -$. The problem so defined is the feedback arc set
problem on distributions of inputs, each of which is a tournament obtained as a
noisy perturbations of a linear order. Note that when $\ga < 1/2$ and $n$ is
large, it is impossible to recover the original order $\pi$.
  It is known that the weighted feedback are set problem on tournaments is
NP-hard in general. Here we present an algorithm of running time
$n^{O(\gamma^{-4})}$ and sampling complexity $O_{\gamma}(n \log n)$ that with
high probability solves the noisy sorting without re-sampling problem. We also
show that if $a_{\sigma(1)},a_{\sigma(2)},...,a_{\sigma(n)}$ is an optimal
solution of the problem then it is ``close'' to the original order. More
formally, with high probability it holds that $\sum_i |\sigma(i) - \pi(i)| =
\Theta(n)$ and $\max_i |\sigma(i) - \pi(i)| = \Theta(\log n)$.
  Our results are of interest in applications to ranking, such as ranking in
sports, or ranking of search items based on comparisons by experts.

How is the OH(1720 MHz) emission of compact maser sources used to study the interaction of supernova remnants with adjacent molecular clouds?,"  Compact OH(1720 MHz) masers have proven to be excellent signposts for the
interaction of supernova remnants with adjacent molecular clouds. Less
appreciated has been the weak, extended OH(1720 MHz) emission which accompanies
strong compact maser sources. Recent single-dish and interferometric
observations reveal the majority of maser-emitting supernova remnants have
accompanying regions of extended maser emission. Enhanced OH abundance created
by the passing shock is observed both as maser emission and absorption against
the strong background of the remnant. Modeling the observed OH profiles gives
an estimate of the physical conditions in which weak, extended maser emission
arises. I will discuss how we can realize the utility of this extended maser
emission, particularly the potential to measure the strength of the post-shock
magnetic field via Zeeman splitting over these large-scales.
"
What is the relationship between crossover operators in Boolean linear programming and the crossover problem?,"  We consider the computational complexity of producing the best possible
offspring in a crossover, given two solutions of the parents. The crossover
operators are studied on the class of Boolean linear programming problems,
where the Boolean vector of variables is used as the solution representation.
By means of efficient reductions of the optimized gene transmitting crossover
problems (OGTC) we show the polynomial solvability of the OGTC for the maximum
weight set packing problem, the minimum weight set partition problem and for
one of the versions of the simple plant location problem. We study a connection
between the OGTC for linear Boolean programming problem and the maximum weight
independent set problem on 2-colorable hypergraph and prove the NP-hardness of
several special cases of the OGTC problem in Boolean linear programming.
"
What is the precision of the measurement of the differential cross section for backward Compton scattering in the accelerator with unpolarized or polarized initial photons?,"  In the strong uniform magnetic field, the noncommutative plane (NCP) caused
by the lowest Landau level (LLL) effect, and QED with NCP (QED-NCP) are
studied. Being similar to the condensed matter theory of quantum Hall effect,
an effective filling factor $f(B)$ is introduced to character the possibility
that the electrons stay on the LLL. The analytic and numerical results of the
differential cross section for the process of backward Compton scattering in
the accelerator with unpolarized or polarized initial photons are calculated.
The existing data of BL38B2 in Spring-8 have been analyzed roughly and compared
with the numerical predictions primitively. We propose a precise measurement of
the differential cross sections of backward Compton scattering in a strong
perpendicular magnetic field, which may lead to reveal the effects of QED-NCP.
"
What are the parameters of the G-matrix calculations used to determine the nuclear binding energies and radii?,"  A non-relativisitic nuclear density functional theory is constructed, not as
usual, from an effective density dependent nucleon-nucleon force but directly
introducing in the functional results from microscopic nuclear and neutron
matter Bruckner G-matrix calculations at various densities. A purely
phenomenological finite range part to account for surface properties is added.
The striking result is that only four to five adjustable parameters, spin-orbit
included, suffice to reproduce nuclear binding energies and radii with the same
quality as obtained with the most performant effective forces, containing on
the order of ten parameters. In this pilot work, for the pairing correlations,
simply a density dependent zero range force is adopted from the literature.
Possible future extensions of this approach are pointed out.
"
What is the integral of the supremum process of standard Brownian motion?,"  In this paper we study the integral of the supremum process of standard
Brownian motion. We present an explicit formula for the moments of the integral
(or area) A(T), covered by the process in the time interval [0,T]. The Laplace
transform of A(T) follows as a consequence. The main proof involves a double
Laplace transform of A(T) and is based on excursion theory and local time for
Brownian motion.
"
What are the implications of unparticles on gauge coupling evolution and fermion production at high energy colliders?,"  Unparticles from hidden conformal sectors provide qualitatively new
possibilities for physics beyond the standard model. In the theoretical
framework of minimal models, we clarify the relation between energy scales
entering various phenomenological analyses. We show that these relations always
counteract the effective field theory intuition that higher dimension operators
are more highly suppressed, and that the requirement of a significant conformal
window places strong constraints on possible unparticle signals. With these
considerations in mind, we examine some of the most robust and sensitive probes
and explore novel effects of unparticles on gauge coupling evolution and
fermion production at high energy colliders. These constraints are presented
both as bounds on four-fermion interaction scales and as constraints on the
fundamental parameter space of minimal models.
"
What are the indicators of relatedness in digital libraries?,"  An important goal for digital libraries is to enable researchers to more
easily explore related work. While citation data is often used as an indicator
of relatedness, in this paper we demonstrate that digital access records (e.g.
http-server logs) can be used as indicators as well. In particular, we show
that measures based on co-access provide better coverage than co-citation, that
they are available much sooner, and that they are more accurate for recent
papers.
"
What are the implications of the dynamic decoupling of the layers in transport measurements at x=1/8?,"  In the stripe-ordered state of a strongly-correlated two-dimensional
electronic system, under a set of special circumstances, the superconducting
condensate, like the magnetic order, can occur at a non-zero wave-vector
corresponding to a spatial period double that of the charge order. In this
case, the Josephson coupling between near neighbor planes, especially in a
crystal with the special structure of La_{2-x}Ba_xCuO_4, vanishes identically.
We propose that this is the underlying cause of the dynamical decoupling of the
layers recently observed in transport measurements at x=1/8.
"
What is the hysteresis of the magnetostructural phase transition in the range x=0.04 to x=0.05?,"  We propose the phase diagram of a new pseudo-ternary compound,
CoMnGe_{1-x}Sn_{x}, in the range x less than or equal to 0.1. Our phase diagram
is a result of magnetic and calometric measurements. We demonstrate the
appearance of a hysteretic magnetostructural phase transition in the range
x=0.04 to x=0.055, similar to that observed in CoMnGe under hydrostatic
pressure. From magnetisation measurements, we show that the isothermal entropy
change associated with the magnetostructural transition can be as high as 4.5
J/(K kg) in a field of 1 Tesla. However, the large thermal hysteresis in this
transition (~20 K) will limit its straightforward use in a magnetocaloric
device.
"
What are the properties of the Fourier coefficients for a function with support in a neighborhood of the origin?,"  The Fourier coefficients of a smooth $K$-invariant function on a compact
symmetric space $M=U/K$ are given by integration of the function against the
spherical functions. For functions with support in a neighborhood of the
origin, we describe the size of the support by means of the exponential type of
a holomorphic extension of the Fourier coefficients
"
What are the results of the MIMO DS-CDMA channel with the multiuser detector?,"  We analyze a MIMO DS-CDMA channel with a general multiuser detector including
a nonlinear multiuser detector, using the replica method. In the many-user,
limit the MIMO DS-CDMA channel with the multiuser detector is decoupled into a
bank of single-user SIMO Gaussian channels if a spatial spreading scheme is
employed. On the other hand, it is decoupled into a bank of single-user MIMO
Gaussian channels if a spatial spreading scheme is not employed. The spectral
efficiency of the MIMO DS-CDMA channel with the spatial spreading scheme is
comparable with that of the MIMO DS-CDMA channel using an optimal space-time
block code without the spatial spreading scheme. In the case of the QPSK data
modulation scheme the spectral efficiency of the MIMO DS-CDMA channel with the
MMSE detector shows {\it waterfall} behavior and is very close to the
corresponding sum capacity when the system load is just below the transition
point of the {\it waterfall} behavior. Our result implies that the performance
of a multiuser detector taking the data modulation scheme into consideration
can be far superior to that of linear multiuser detectors.
"
What are the key features of the projective Hilbert space P(H) as a measurable structure?,"  A systematic review of the various topologies that can be defined on the
projective Hilbert space P(H), i.e., on the set of the pure quantum states, is
presented. It is shown that P(H) carries a natural topology as well as a
natural measurable structure.
"
What are the results of the Rietveld refinement analyses of X-ray diffraction data?,"  Nanocrystalline (Th1-xFex)O2-d particles with different Fe concentrations (x
= 0.0, 0.05, 0.10, 0.15, 0.20 and 0.25) have been prepared by a gel combustion
method. Rietveld refinement analyses of X-ray diffraction data revealed the
formation of an impurity free cubic type Th1-xFexO2-d structure up to x = 0.20.
This observation is further confirmed from the detailed studies conducted on 10
at. percent Fe doped ThO2 using high-resolution transmission electron
microscopy (HRTEM) imaging and indexing of the selected-area electron
diffraction (SAED) patterns. DC Magnetization studies as a function field
indicate that they are ferromagnetic with Curie temperature (Tc) well above
room temperature.
"
What are the implications of the new relation for the Lagrangian of order p^6 in the two-flavour sector?,"  We show that the number of operators in the presently known mesonic chiral
Lagrangian of order p^6 in the two-flavour sector can be reduced by at least
one from 57 to 56 by providing an explicit relation among the operators. We
briefly discuss the relevance of this new relation.
"
"What is the Binder cumulant in the SO(1,N) sigma-models?","  Noncompact SO(1,N) sigma-models are studied in terms of their large N
expansion in a lattice formulation in dimensions d \geq 2. Explicit results for
the spin and current two-point functions as well as for the Binder cumulant are
presented to next to leading order on a finite lattice. The dynamically
generated gap is negative and serves as a coupling-dependent infrared regulator
which vanishes in the limit of infinite lattice size. The cancellation of
infrared divergences in invariant correlation functions in this limit is
nontrivial and is in d=2 demonstrated by explicit computation for the above
quantities. For the Binder cumulant the thermodynamic limit is finite and is
given by 2/(N+1) in the order considered. Monte Carlo simulations suggest that
the remainder is small or zero. The potential implications for ``criticality''
and ``triviality'' of the theories in the SO(1,N) invariant sector are
discussed.
"
What are the properties of the frustrated phase separation in strongly correlated electronic systems?,"  Competition between interactions on different length scales leads to
self-organized textures in classical as well as quantum systems. This pattern
formation phenomenon has been invoked to explain some intriguing properties of
a large variety of strongly correlated electronic systems that includes for
example high temperature superconductors and colossal magnetoresistance
manganites. We classify the more common situations in which Coulomb frustrated
phase separation can occur and review their properties.
"
"How do the observed pulsar characteristics, such as drifting subpulses and nulling, change with the pulsar's age and observing frequency?","  A large sample of pulsars has been observed to study their subpulse
modulation at an observing wavelength (when achievable) of both 21 and 92 cm
using the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope. In this paper we present the
92-cm data and a comparison is made with the already published 21-cm results.
We analysed 191 pulsars at 92 cm using fluctuation spectra. The sample of
pulsars is as unbiased as possible towards any particular pulsar
characteristics. For 15 pulsars drifting subpulses are discovered for the first
time and 26 of the new drifters found in the 21-cm data are confirmed. We
discovered nulling for 8 sources and 8 pulsars are found to intermittently emit
single pulses that have pulse energies similar to giant pulses. It is estimated
that at least half of the total population of pulsars have drifting subpulses
when observations with a high enough signal-to-noise ratio would be available.
It could well be that the drifting subpulse mechanism is an intrinsic property
of the emission mechanism itself, although for some pulsars it is difficult or
impossible to detect. Drifting subpulses are in general found at both
frequencies, although the chance of detecting drifting subpulses is possibly
slightly higher at 92 cm. It appears that the youngest pulsars have the most
disordered subpulses and the subpulses become more and more organized into
drifting subpulses as the pulsar ages. The correlations with the modulation
indices are argued to be consistent with the picture in which the radio
emission can be divided in a drifting subpulse signal plus a quasi-steady
signal which becomes, on average, stronger at high observing frequencies. The
measured values of P3 at the two frequencies are highly correlated, but there
is no evidence for a correlation with other pulsar parameters.
"
What is the Krylov method used to solve a Helmholtz equation in a domain?,"  The aim of this work is to perform numerical simulations of the propagation
of a laser in a plasma. At each time step, one has to solve a Helmholtz
equation in a domain which consists in some hundreds of millions of cells. To
solve this huge linear system, one uses a iterative Krylov method with a
preconditioning by a separable matrix. The corresponding linear system is
solved with a block cyclic reduction method. Some enlightments on the parallel
implementation are also given. Lastly, numerical results are presented
including some features concerning the scalability of the numerical method on a
parallel architecture.
"
What are the features extracted from the leaf images used to train the PNN?,"  In this paper, we employ Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN) with image and
data processing techniques to implement a general purpose automated leaf
recognition algorithm. 12 leaf features are extracted and orthogonalized into 5
principal variables which consist the input vector of the PNN. The PNN is
trained by 1800 leaves to classify 32 kinds of plants with an accuracy greater
than 90%. Compared with other approaches, our algorithm is an accurate
artificial intelligence approach which is fast in execution and easy in
implementation.
"
What is the polynomial algorithm used to decide if a graph has entanglement at most 1?,"  Entanglement is a complexity measure of directed graphs that origins in fixed
point theory. This measure has shown its use in designing efficient algorithms
to verify logical properties of transition systems. We are interested in the
problem of deciding whether a graph has entanglement at most k. As this measure
is defined by means of games, game theoretic ideas naturally lead to design
polynomial algorithms that, for fixed k, decide the problem. Known
characterizations of directed graphs of entanglement at most 1 lead, for k = 1,
to design even faster algorithms. In this paper we present an explicit
characterization of undirected graphs of entanglement at most 2. With such a
characterization at hand, we devise a linear time algorithm to decide whether
an undirected graph has this property.
"
What is the relationship between Type IIn supernovae and their polarimetric characteristics?,"  While the members of the Type IIn category of supernovae are united by the
presence of strong multicomponent Balmer emission lines in their spectra, they
are quite heterogeneous with respect to other properties such as Balmer line
profiles, light curves, strength of radio emission, and intrinsic brightness.
We are now beginning to see variety among SNe IIn in their polarimetric
characteristics as well, some but not all of which may be due to inclination
angle effects. The increasing number of known ""hybrid"" SNe with IIn-like
emission lines suggests that circumstellar material may be more common around
all types of SNe than previously thought. Investigation of the correlations
between spectropolarimetric signatures and other IIn attributes will help us
address the question of classification of ""interacting SNe"" and the possibility
of distinguishing different groups within the diverse IIn subclass.
"
"What are the expressions for the energy, linear momentum and angular momentum carried away from an isolated system by gravitational radiation?","  We present expressions for the energy, linear momentum and angular momentum
carried away from an isolated system by gravitational radiation based on
spin-weighted spherical harmonics decomposition of the Weyl scalar $\Psi_4$. We
also show that the expressions derived are equivalent to the common expressions
obtained when using a framework based on perturbations of a Schwazschild
background. The main idea is to collect together all the different expressions
in a uniform and consistent way. The formulae presented here are directly
applicable to the calculation of the radiated energy, linear momentum and
angular momentum starting from the gravitational waveforms which are typically
extracted from numerical simulations.
"
What are the CIB levels observed in the spectra of high-z GRBs and blazars?,"  Cosmic infrared background (CIB) includes emissions from objects inaccessible
to current telescopic studies, such as the putative Population III, the first
stars. Recently, strong direct evidence for significant CIB levels produced by
the first stars came from CIB fluctuations discovered in deep Spitzer images.
Such CIB levels should have left a unique absorption feature in the spectra of
high-z GRBs and blazars as suggested in [4]. This is observable with GLAST
sources at z>2 and measuring this absorption will give important information on
energetics and constituents of the first stars era.
"
What is the relationship between the cranking model and the random phase approximation?,"  Based on the cranking model and the random phase approximation, we point out
that the wobbling excitation on top of the s band in ^{182}Os is stable against
angular momentum tilting. This is consistent with the general trend that the
wobbling excitations in \gamma<0 rotating nuclei are more stable than those in
\gamma>0 ones found in our previous studies. In higher N isotopes known to be
\gamma soft, however, a different type of tilting instability is expected. Its
possible correspondence to the experimental data is also discussed.
"
What is the direct photon production an important observable in heavy ion collisions?,"  Direct photon production is an important observable in heavy ion collisions
as photons are penetrating and therefore largely insensetive to final state
effects that lead to jet quenching. Measurements of the fragmentation component
to prompt photon yields in p+p and Au+Au collisions will provide both an
important test of pQCD predictions and of predictions for modifications of this
component in heavy ion collisions. By selecting photons associated with jets on
the near side using hadron-photon correlations, fragmentation photons can be
measured directly.
"
What are the global-in-time Strichartz estimates for the Schrödinger evolution corresponding to small perturbations of the Laplacian?,"  In this article we study global-in-time Strichartz estimates for the
Schr\""odinger evolution corresponding to long-range perturbations of the
Euclidean Laplacian. This is a natural continuation of a recent article of the
third author, where it is proved that local smoothing estimates imply
Strichartz estimates. In the aforementioned paper, the third author proved the
local smoothing estimates for small perturbations of the Laplacian. Here we
consider the case of large perturbations in three increasingly favorable
scenarios: (i) without non-trapping assumptions we prove estimates outside a
compact set modulo a lower order spatially localized error term, (ii) with
non-trapping assumptions we prove global estimates modulo a lower order
spatially localized error term, and (iii) for time independent operators with
no resonance or eigenvalue at the bottom of the spectrum we prove global
estimates for the projection onto the continuous spectrum.
"
What are the effects of localized Fgf8 perturbations on somite patterning in vertebrate development?,"  In most vertebrate species, the body axis is generated by the formation of
repeated transient structures called somites. This spatial periodicity in
somitogenesis has been related to the temporally sustained oscillations in
certain mRNAs and their associated gene products in the cells forming the
presomatic mesoderm. The mechanism underlying these oscillations have been
identified as due to the delays involved in the synthesis of mRNA and
translation into protein molecules [J. Lewis, Current Biol. {\bf 13}, 1398
(2003)]. In addition, in the zebrafish embryo intercellular Notch signalling
couples these oscillators and a longitudinal positional information signal in
the form of an Fgf8 gradient exists that could be used to transform these
coupled temporal oscillations into the observed spatial periodicity of somites.
Here we consider a simple model based on this known biology and study its
consequences for somitogenesis. Comparison is made with the known properties of
somite formation in the zebrafish embryo . We also study the effects of
localized Fgf8 perturbations on somite patterning.
"
What is the relationship between the inhomogeneous incipient infinite cluster and the critical exponents?,"  We reinvestigate the 2D problem of the inhomogeneous incipient infinite
cluster where, in an independent percolation model, the density decays to p_c
with an inverse power, \lambda, of the distance to the origin. Assuming the
existence of critical exponents (as is known in the case of the triangular site
lattice) if the power is less than 1/\nu, with \nu the correlation length
exponent, we demonstrate an infinite cluster with scale dimension given by
D_H=2-\beta\lambda. Further, we investigate the critical case \lambda_c=1/\nu
and show that iterated logarithmic corrections will tip the balance between the
possibility and impossibility of an infinite cluster.
"
What is the thermoelectric figure-of-merit ZT of polypyrrole compared to that of traditional inorganic thermoelectric materials?,"  Polypyrrole chemically synthesized on PET gives rise to textiles with a high
electric conductivity, suitable for several applications from antistatics to
electromagnetic interference shielding devices. Here, we discuss investigations
on thermal electric performances of the polypyrrole coated PET in a wide range
of temperatures above room temperature. The Seebeck coefficient turns out to be
comparable with that of metal thermocouple materials. Since polypyrrole shows
extremely low thermal diffusivities regardless of the electrical conductivity,
the low thermal conductivity gives significant advantage to the thermoelectric
figure-of-merit ZT, comparable with that of some traditional inorganic
thermoelectric materials. The heat generation is also investigated for possible
heating textile devices.
"
What is the novel effect observed in the dynamics of wave packets in a two-dimensional crystal?,"  In the present work we deal with the dynamics of wave packets in a
two-dimensional crystal under the action of magnetic and electric fields. The
magnetic field is perpendicular to the plane and the electric field is on the
plane. In the simulations we considered a symmetric gauge for the vector
potential while the initial wave packet was assumed to have a gaussian
structure with given velocities. The parameters that control the kind of time
evolution of the packets are: the width of the gaussian, its velocity, and, the
intensity and direction of the electric field as well as the magnitude of the
magnetic field. In order to characterize the kind of propagation we evaluated
the mean-square displacement (MSD), the participation function and which is
more important we were able to follow the wave at different times, which
allowed us to see the time evolution of the centroid of the wave packets. A
novel effect was observed, namely, the dynamics is such that the wave function
\emph{splits} into two or more components and \emph{reconstructs} successively
as time goes, vortices are forming. To our understanding this is the first time
such an effect is reported. As for the inclusion of the electric field, we
observe a complex behavior of the wave packet as well as note that the vortices
propagate in direction perpendicular to the applied electric field. A similar
behavior presented by the classical treatment, In our case we give a quantum
mechanics explanation for that
"
What are the thermodynamic properties of a Kerr black hole?,"  The thermodynamics of black holes is reformulated within the context of the
recently developed formalism of geometrothermodynamics. This reformulation is
shown to be invariant with respect to Legendre transformations, and to allow
several equivalent representations. Legendre invariance allows us to explain a
series of contradictory results known in the literature from the use of
Weinhold's and Ruppeiner's thermodynamic metrics for black holes. For the
Reissner-Nordstr\""om black hole the geometry of the space of equilibrium states
is curved, showing a non trivial thermodynamic interaction, and the curvature
contains information about critical points and phase transitions. On the
contrary, for the Kerr black hole the geometry is flat and does not explain its
phase transition structure.
"
What is the lower bound on the Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy of semiclassical measures in the case of variable negative curvature?,"  We study the high--energy limit for eigenfunctions of the laplacian, on a
compact negatively curved manifold. We review the recent result of
Anantharaman-Nonnenmacher giving a lower bound on the Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy
of semiclassical measures, and improve this lower bound in the case of variable
negative curvature.
"
What are the chemical abundances of early-B supergiants in this galaxy?,"  We present multi-object spectroscopy of young, massive stars in the Local
Group galaxy IC 1613. We provide the spectral classification and a detailed
spectral catalog for 54 OBA stars in this galaxy. The majority of the
photometrically selected sample is composed of B- and A-type supergiants. The
remaining stars include early O-type dwarfs and the only Wolf-Rayet star known
in this galaxy. Among the early B stars we have serendipitously uncovered 6 Be
stars, the largest spectroscopically confirmed sample of this class of objects
beyond the Magellanic Clouds. We measure chemical abundances for 9 early-B
supergiants, and find a mean oxygen abundance of 12+log(O/H)=7.90 +/- 0.08.
This value is consistent with the result we obtain for two HII regions in which
we detect the temperature-sensitive [OIII]4363 auroral line.
"
What are the implications of a mapping class on a compact oriented surface?,"  We prove that any mapping class on a compact oriented surface with nonempty
boundary can be made pseudo-Anosov and right-veering after a sequence of
positive stabilizations.
"
What are the physical conditions that give rise to the observed abundance patterns of light nuclei in Galactic globular clusters?,"  Hydrogen-burning is the root cause of the star-to-star abundance variations
of light nuclei in Galactic globular clusters (GC). In the present work we
constrain the physical conditions that gave rise to the observed abundance
patterns of Li, C, N, O, Na, Mg, Al, as well as Mg isotopes in the typical case
of NGC6752. We perform nucleosynthesis calculations at constant temperature,
adopting realistic initial abundances for the proto-cluster gas. We use a
detailed nuclear reaction network and state-of-the-art nuclear reaction rates.
Although simplistic, our analysis provides original results and new constraints
on the self-enrichment scenario for GCs. Our parametrized calculations allow us
to determine a narrow range of temperature where the observed extreme
abundances of all light elements and isotopes in NGC6752 are nicely reproduced
simultaneously. This agreement is obtained after mixing of the H-processed
material with 30 % of unprocessed gas. The observed C-N, O-Na, Mg-Al, Li-Na and
F-Na anticorrelations, as well as the behaviour of the Mg isotopes can be
recovered by assuming mixing with even larger dilution factors. Li production
by the stars that build up the other abundance anomalies is not mandatory in
the case of NGC 6752. Observations of O, Na, Mg and Al constrain the
temperature range for H-burning; such temperatures are encountered in the two
main candidate ``polluters'' proposed for GCs, namely massive AGBs and the most
massive main-sequence stars. (Abridged).
"
What is the role of the Hubbard U term in the Wilson's numerical renormalization group (NRG) technique?,"  Using Wilson's numerical renormalization group (NRG) technique we compute
zero-bias conductance and various correlation functions of a double quantum dot
(DQD) system. We present different regimes within a phase diagram of the DQD
system. By introducing a negative Hubbard U on one of the quantum dots, we
simulate the effect of electron-phonon coupling and explore the properties of
the coexisting spin and charge Kondo state. In a triple quantum dot (TQD)
system a multi-stage Kondo effect appears where localized moments on quantum
dots are screened successively at exponentially distinct Kondo temperatures.
"
What is the assumption about the symmetry of the lepton mass matrix model?,"  Based on an assumption that an S_4 flavor symmetry is embedded into SU(3), a
lepton mass matrix model is investigated. A Frogatt-Nielsen type model is
assumed, and the flavor structures of the masses and mixing are caused by VEVs
of SU(2)_L-singlet scalars \phi_u and \phi_d which are nonets (8+1) of the
SU(3) flavor symmetry, and which are broken into 2+3+3' and 1 of S_4. If we
require the invariance under the transformation (\phi^{(8)},\phi^{(1)}) \to
(-\phi^{(8)},+\phi^{(1)}) for the superpotential of the nonet field
\phi^{(8+1)}, the model leads to a beautiful relation for the charged lepton
masses. The observed tribimaximal neutrino mixing is understood by assuming two
SU(3) singlet right-handed neutrinos \nu_R^{(\pm)} and an SU(3) triplet scalar
\chi.
"
What are the distinct spin wave modes observed in a ferromagnet with finite size?,"  Topological winding and unwinding in a quasi-one-dimensional metastable
  Bose-Einstein condensate are shown to be manipulated by changing the strength
of interaction or the frequency of rotation. Exact diagonalization analysis
reveals that quasidegenerate states emerge spontaneously near the transition
point, allowing a smooth crossover between topologically distinct states. On a
mean-field level, the transition is accompanied by formation of grey solitons,
or density notches, which serve as an experimental signature of this
phenomenon.
"
What is the relationship between the space X and the function Phi?,"  Assume that X is a metrizable separable space, and each clopen-valued lower
semicontinuous multivalued map Phi from X to Q has a continuous selection. Our
main result is that in this case, X is a sigma-space. We also derive a partial
converse implication, and present a reformulation of the Scheepers Conjecture
in the language of continuous selections.
"
How do the IR colors of planetary nebulae compare to those of other astronomical objects?,"  We compare H-alpha, radio continuum, and Spitzer Space Telescope (SST) images
of 58 planetary nebulae (PNe) recently discovered by the Macquarie-AAO-Strasbo-
urg H-alpha PN Project (MASH) of the SuperCOSMOS H-alpha Survey. Using InfraRed
Array Camera (IRAC) data we define the IR colors of PNe and demonstrate good
isolation between these colors and those of many other types of astronomical
object. The only substantive contamination of PNe in the color-color plane we
illustrate is due to YSOs. However, this ambiguity is readily resolved by the
unique optical characteristics of PNe and their environs. We also examine the
relationships between optical and MIR morphologies from 3.6 to 8.0um and
explore the ratio of mid-infrared (MIR) to radio nebular fluxes, which is a
valuable discriminant between thermal and nonthermal emission. MASH emphasizes
late evolutionary stages of PNe compared with previous catalogs, enabling study
of the changes in MIR and radio flux that attend the aging process. Spatially
integrated MIR energy distributions were constructed for all MASH PNe observed
by the GLIMPSE Legacy Project, using the H-alpha morphologies to establish the
dimensions for the calculations of the Midcourse Space Experiment (MSX), IRAC,
and radio continuum (from the Molonglo Observatory Synthesis Telescope and the
Very Large Array) flux densities. The ratio of IRAC 8.0-um to MSX 8.3-um flux
densities provides a measure of the absolute diffuse calibration of IRAC at 8.0
um. We independently confirm the aperture correction factor to be applied to
IRAC at 8.0um to align it with the diffuse calibration of MSX. The result
agrees with the recommendations of the Spitzer Science Center and with results
from a parallel study of HII regions. These PNe probe the diffuse calibration
of IRAC on a spatial scale of 9-77 arcsec.

What are the implications of a baryonic bound state of strongly interacting messenger particles for the cold dark matter?,"  Among various supersymmetric (SUSY) models, gauge-mediated SUSY breaking
models with an ultra-light gravitino of mass m_{3/2} \lesssim O(10) eV are very
attractive, since they are completely free from notorious gravitino problems. A
drawback of such a scenario is the absence of the supersymmetric cold dark
matter. In this letter, we propose that a baryonic bound state of strongly
interacting messenger particles, with a mass of O(100) TeV, can naturally be
the cold dark matter. We also exemplify a model which realizes such a scenario.
"
What are the combined effects of electron correlations and lattice distortions on the charge ordering in a 3/4-filled extended Hubbard model?,"  Combined effects of electron correlations and lattice distortions are
investigated on the charge ordering in \theta-(BEDT-TTF)2RbZn(SCN)4
theoretically in a two-dimensional 3/4-filled extended Hubbard model with
electron-lattice couplings. It is known that this material undergoes a phase
transition from a high-symmetry metallic state to a low-symmetry insulating
state with a horizontal-stripe charge order (CO) by lowering temperature. By
means of the exact-diagonalization method, we show that electron-phonon
interactions are crucial to stabilize the horizontal-stripe CO and to realize
the low-symmetry crystal structure.
"
What is the cause of the deformation of the Wigner crystal by boundaries?,"  The spatial Fourier spectrum of the electron density distribution in a finite
1D system and the distribution function of electrons over single-particle
states are studied in detail to show that there are two universal features in
their behavior, which characterize the electron ordering and the deformation of
Wigner crystal by boundaries. The distribution function has a $\delta$-like
singularity at the Fermi momentum $k_F$. The Fourier spectrum of the density
has a step-like form at the wavevector $2k_F$, with the harmonics being absent
or vanishing above this threshold. These features are found by calculations
using exact diagonalization method. They are shown to be caused by Wigner
ordering of electrons, affected by the boundaries. However the common Luttinger
liquid model with open boundaries fails to capture these features, because it
overestimates the deformation of the Wigner crystal. An improvement of the
Luttinger liquid model is proposed which allows one to describe the above
features correctly. It is based on the corrected form of the density operator
conserving the particle number.
"
What is the Iwasawa decomposition of a function?,"  It is about the uniqueness of the Iwasawa decomposition.
"
What can be said about the relationship between the Kalman map and the Markov process?,"  It is shown that large deviation statistical quantities of the discrete time,
finite state Markov process $P_{n+1}^{(j)}=\sum_{k=1}^NH_{jk}P_n^{(k)}$, where
P_n^{(j)} is the probability for the j-state at the time step n and H_{jk} is
the transition probability, completely coincides with those from the Kalman map
corresponding to the above Markov process. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that
by using simple examples, time correlation functions in finite state Markov
processes can be well described in terms of unstable periodic orbits embedded
in the equivalent Kalman maps.
"
What is the relation between the symmetric coalgebra and permutahedra?,"  For any L-infinity algebra L, we construct an A-infinity structure on the
space of symmetric tensors Sym*(L), which generalizes the classical universal
enveloping for Lie algebras. Our construction is based on an invariant homotopy
on a cobar construction of the symmetric coalgebra, which is obtained through
its relation with permutahedra and Young tableaux.
"
What is the structural property of BiMnO3?,"  The structural properties of BiMn$O_3$ were determined from neutron powder
diffraction data as a function of temperature and magnetic field. The structure
at all temperatures was found to be centrosymmetric with space group $C2/c$,
which is incompatible with ferroelectricity. At T$_C\simeq 100 K$, we observed
the onset of a large magnetoelastic strain, proportional to the square of the
magnetization. We interpret this structural rearrangement, together with the
previously observed magnetodielectric anomalies, as due to the need to optimize
the partially frustrated magnetic interactions.
"
What are the implications of the correlation between the electroweak symmetry breaking scale and the average stop mass scale in supersymmetric models?,"  We show that the little hierarchy problem can be solved in the no-scale
supergravity framework. In this model the supersymmetry breaking scale is
generated when the electroweak symmetry breaking condition is satisfied and
therefore, unlike usual supersymmetric models, the correlation between the
electroweak symmetry breaking scale and the average stop mass scale can be
justified. This correlation solves the little hierarchy puzzle. Using minimal
supergravity boundary conditions, we find that the parameter space predicted by
no-scale supergravity is allowed by all possible experimental constraints. The
predicted values of supersymmetric particle masses are low enough to be very
easily accessible at the LHC. This parameter space will also be probed in the
upcoming results from the dark matter direct detection experiments.
"
What are the dominant sources of the transverse-spin asymmetry in dijet production in hadronic collisions?,"  We study the single transverse-spin asymmetry for dijet production in
hadronic collisions in both the collinear QCD factorization approach and the
Brodsky-Hwang-Schmidt model. We show that a nonvanishing asymmetry is generated
by both initial-state and final-state interactions, and that the final-state
interactions dominate. We find that in the leading kinematic region where the
transverse momentum imbalance of the two jets, q_\perp = P_{1\perp}+P_{2\perp},
is much less than the momentum of either jet, the contribution from the lowest
non-trivial perturbative order to both the spin-averaged and the spin-dependent
dijet cross sections can be factorized into a hard part that is a function only
of the averaged jet momentum P_\perp = (P_{1\perp}-P_{2\perp})/2, and
perturbatively generated transverse momentum dependent (TMD) parton
distributions. We show that the spin asymmetry at this non-trivial perturbative
order can be described by the TMD parton distributions defined in either
semi-inclusive DIS or the Drell-Yan process. We derive the same hard parts from
both the collinear factorization approach and in the context of the
Brodsky-Hwang-Schmidt model, verifying that they are not sensitive to details
of the factorized long distance physics.
"
What are the applications of the purification in state preparation?,"  A basic feasible probabilistic purification of unknown noisy coherent states,
outgoing from different state preparations with unknown mean number of thermal
photons, is proposed. The scheme is based only on a linear-optical network with
an avalanche photo-diode or heterodyne (homodyne) detection used to post-select
a successful processing. The suggested probabilistic method can produce an
output state with a lower noise than both quantum deterministic and classical
probabilistic distillation method. The purification applied in the state
preparation can increase classical capacity of communication and security of
quantum key distribution.
"
What is the significance of the discovery of a 1.8 M_Jup planet in a 538 day period orbit around a metal-poor star?,"  In this paper we present the detection of a 1.8 M_Jup planet in a 538 day
period trajectory orbiting the metal-poor star HD171028 ([Fe/H]=-0.49). This
planet is the first to be discovered in the context of a HARPS program
searching for planets around metal-poor stars. Interestingly, HD171028 is one
of the least metal-poor stars in the sample. This discovery is placed in the
context of the models of planet formation and evolution.
"
What are the constraints on gravity scale $M_P$ in extra-dimensional gravitational theory?,"  We study the constraints on gravity scale $M_P$ in extra-dimension
gravitational theory, obtained from gravity-induced processes. The obtained
constraints are subdivided into strong (though not robust) and reliable (though
less strong). The strong constraints can be in principle relaxed due to some
broken gauge symmetries, e.g. family symmetry. The strongest constraint is
given by neutrino oscillations. For different assumptions the lower bound on
$M_P$ is $10^{15} - 10^{18}$ GeV. However, it can be, in principle, reduced by
broken family symmetry. More reliable bounds are due to flavor-conserved
operators or those which change the flavors within one family. These bounds,
obtained using the electron mass and width of $\pi \to e\nu$ decay, are
$1\times 10^5$ GeV and $5\times 10^5$ GeV, for these two cases, respectively.
"
What are the key concepts of an optical coupler for generating chaotic beats?,"  The letter proposes a procedure for generation of strongly chaotic beats that
have been hardly obtainable hitherto. The beats are generated in a nonlinear
optical system governing second-harmonic generation of light. The proposition
is based on the concept of an optical coupler but can be easily adopted to
other nonlinear systems and Chua's circuits.
"
What is the property of a set A_0 in a sigma-field that satisfies the 0-1 law?,"  Let (\Omega,\mathcal{B},P) be a probability space, \mathcal{A} a
sub-sigma-field of \mathcal{B}, and \mu a regular conditional distribution for
P given \mathcal{A}. For various, classically interesting, choices of
\mathcal{A} (including tail and symmetric) the following 0-1 law is proved:
There is a set A_0 in \mathcal{A} such that P(A_0)=1 and \mu(\omega)(A) is 0 or
1 for all A in \mathcal{A} and \omega in A_0. Provided \mathcal{B} is countably
generated (and certain regular conditional distributions exist), the result
applies whatever P is.
"
What is the construction of the dynamical systems using braids?,"  In this paper, we give an explicit construction of dynamical systems (defined
within a solid torus) containing any knot (or link) and arbitrarily knotted
chaos. The first is achieved by expressing the knots in terms of braids,
defining a system containing the braids and extending periodically to obtain a
system naturally defined on a torus and which contains the given knotted
trajectories. To get explicit differential equations for dynamical systems
containing the braids, we will use a certain function to define a tube
neigbourhood of the braid. The second one, generating chaotic systems, is
realized by modeling the Smale horseshoe.
"
What is the quantum state of the entire cosmos?,"  A quantum state of the entire cosmos (universe or multiverse) is proposed
which is the equal mixture of the Giddings-Marolf states that are
asymptotically single de Sitter spacetimes in both past and future and are
regular on the throat or neck of minimal three-volume. That is, states are
excluded that have a big bang or big crunch or which split into multiple
asymptotic de Sitter spacetimes. (For simplicity, transitions between different
values of the cosmological constant are assumed not to occur, though different
positive values are allowed.) The entropy of this mixed state appears to be of
the order of the three-fourths power of the Bekenstein-Hawking A/4 entropy of
de Sitter spacetime. Most of the component pure states do not have rapid
inflation, but when an inflaton is present and the states are weighted by the
volume at the end of inflation, a much smaller number of states may dominate
and give a large amount of inflation and hence may agree with observations.
"
What is the dependence of temperature and velocity oscillations on the Rayleigh-Bernard parameter?,"  Temperature and velocity oscillations have been found in a rectangular
Rayleigh-B\'{e}nard convection cell, in which one large scale convection roll
exists. At $Ra=8.9 \times 10^{11}$ and $Pr=4$, temperature oscillation can be
observed in most part of the system and the oscillation period remains almost
constant, $t_T = 74 \pm 2$ seconds. Velocity oscillation can only be found in
its horizontal component, $v_y$ (perpendicular to large scale circulation
plane), near the cell sidewall, its oscillation period is also constant, $t_T =
65 \pm 2$ seconds, at these positions. Temperature and velocity oscillations
have different Ra dependence, which are respectively indicated by Peclect
number $Pe_T = 0.55Ra^{0.47}$ and $Pe_v = 0.28Ra^{0.50}$ . In comparison to the
case of cylindrical cell, we find that the velocity oscillation is affected by
the system geometry.
"
What is the global well-posedness of the energy space for the new ingredient?,"  We consider the defocusing, $\dot{H}^1$-critical Hartree equation for the
radial data in all dimensions $(n\geq 5)$. We show the global well-posedness
and scattering results in the energy space. The new ingredient in this paper is
that we first take advantage of the term $\displaystyle - \int_{I}\int_{|x|\leq
A|I|^{1/2}}|u|^{2}\Delta \Big(\frac{1}{|x|}\Big)dxdt$ in the localized Morawetz
identity to rule out the possibility of energy concentration, instead of the
classical Morawetz estimate dependent of the nonlinearity.
"
,"  For the BCS equation with local two-body interaction $\lambda V(x)$, we give
a rigorous analysis of the asymptotic behavior of the critical temperature as
$\lambda \to 0$. We derive necessary and sufficient conditions on $V(x)$ for
the existence of a non-trivial solution for all values of $\lambda>0$.
"
What is the torus concept as a structural component of active galactic nuclei?,"  The torus concept as an essential structural component of active galactic
nuclei (AGN) is generally accepted. Here, the situation is discussed when the
torus ""twisting"" by the radiation or wind transforms it into a dipole toroidal
vortex which in turn can be a source of matter replenishing the accretion disk.
Thus emerging instability which can be responsible for quasar radiation flares
accompanied by matter outbursts is also discussed. The ""Matreshka"" scheme for
an obscuring vortex torus structure capable of explaining the AGN variability
and evolution is proposed. The model parameters estimated numerically for the
luminosity close to the Eddington limit agree well with the observations.
"
What is the Random Matrix Theory (RMT) approach used to analyze the traffic behavior of a network?,"  The traffic behavior of University of Louisville network with the
interconnected backbone routers and the number of Virtual Local Area Network
(VLAN) subnets is investigated using the Random Matrix Theory (RMT) approach.
We employ the system of equal interval time series of traffic counts at all
router to router and router to subnet connections as a representation of the
inter-VLAN traffic. The cross-correlation matrix C of the traffic rate changes
between different traffic time series is calculated and tested against
null-hypothesis of random interactions.
  The majority of the eigenvalues \lambda_{i} of matrix C fall within the
bounds predicted by the RMT for the eigenvalues of random correlation matrices.
The distribution of eigenvalues and eigenvectors outside of the RMT bounds
displays prominent and systematic deviations from the RMT predictions.
Moreover, these deviations are stable in time.
  The method we use provides a unique possibility to accomplish three
concurrent tasks of traffic analysis. The method verifies the uncongested state
of the network, by establishing the profile of random interactions. It
recognizes the system-specific large-scale interactions, by establishing the
profile of stable in time non-random interactions. Finally, by looking into the
eigenstatistics we are able to detect and allocate anomalies of network traffic
interactions.
"
What are the components of the broadcasting system in the protocol for entanglement broadcasting?,"  We present a scheme for broadcasting of continuous variable entanglement. We
show how an initial two-mode squeezed state of the electromagnetic field shared
by two distant parties can be broadcasted into two nonlocal bipartite entangled
states. Our protocol uses a local linear amplifier and a beam splitter at each
end. We compute the fidelity of the output entangled states and show that the
broadcasting can be implemented for a variety of input squeezed states and
amplifier phases.
"
What are the effects of finite momentum transfer $t$ and $M$ on inclusive unpolarized and polarized deep-inelastic diffractive scattering?,"  We describe the twist-2 contributions to inclusive unpolarized and polarized
deep-inelastic diffractive scattering in an operator approach. The
representation refers to the observed large rapidity gap but does not require
reference to a pomeron picture. We discuss both the case of vanishing target
mass $M$ and momentum transfer $t$ as well as the effects at finite $t$ and
$M$, which lead to modifications at large $\beta$ and low values of $Q^2$.
"
What is the Kaplan-Yorke dimension of the attractor in the phase space?,"  We study the motion of small particles in a random turbulent flow assuming
linear law of friction. We derive a symmetry relation obeyed by the large
deviations of the finite time Lyapunov exponents in the phase space. The
relation applies when either the statistics of the strain matrix is invariant
under the transposition or when it is time-reversible. We show that, as a
result, the Lyapunov exponents come in pairs which sum is equal to minus the
inverse relaxation time of the particles. We use the pairing to consider the
Kaplan-Yorke dimension of the particles attractor in the phase space. In
particular, the results apply to case of the flow which is white noise in time.
"
What is the new method of measuring redshifts of galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)?,"  Traditional photometric redshift methods use only color information about the
objects in question to estimate their redshifts. This paper introduces a new
method utilizing colors, luminosity, surface brightness, and radial light
profile to measure the redshifts of galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey
(SDSS). We take a statistical approach: distributions of galaxies from the SDSS
Large-Scale Structure (LSS; spectroscopic) sample are constructed at a range of
redshifts, and target galaxies are compared to these distributions. An adaptive
mesh is implemented to increase the percentage of the parameter space populated
by the LSS galaxies. We test the method on a subset of galaxies from the LSS
sample, yielding rms Delta-z of 0.025 for red galaxies and 0.030 for blue
galaxies (all with z < 0.25). Possible future improvements to this promising
technique are described, as is our ongoing work to extend the method to
galaxies at higher redshift.
"
What are the limits for the magnetic monopole pair-production cross-section?,"  This letter describes a direct search for pair produced magnetic monopoles in
e+e- collisions. The analysis is based on 62.7 pb^-1 of data collected with the
OPAL detector at an average centre-of-mass energy of sqrt(s)= 206.3GeV. The
monopole signal was assumed to be characterized by two back-to-back particles
with an anomalously high ionization energy loss de/dx in the tracking chambers.
No evidence for production of monopoles was observed. Upper limits were
obtained on the magnetic monopole pair-production cross-section (sigma) in the
mass range 45 GeV/c^2<m_M<102 GeV/c^2. The average limit is sigma < 0.05 pb and
is essentially independent of the magnetic monopole mass. The cross-section
limit is derived at the 95% confidence level and is valid for spin-1/2 magnetic
monopoles.
"
What are the connections between T-duality and mirror symmetry in a Kahler manifold?,"  We study the geometry of complexified moduli spaces of special Lagrangian
submanifolds in the complement of an anticanonical divisor in a compact Kahler
manifold. In particular, we explore the connections between T-duality and
mirror symmetry in concrete examples, and show how quantum corrections arise in
this context.
"
What are the conditions for a local system on a non-translated irreducible component of the first characteristic variety to be 1-admissible?,"  A rank one local system $\LL$ on a smooth complex algebraic variety $M$ is
1-admissible if the dimension of the first cohomology group $H^1(M,\LL)$ can be
computed from the cohomology algebra $H^*(M,\C)$ in degrees $\leq 2$. Under the
assumption that $M$ is 1-formal, we show that all local systems, except
finitely many, on a non-translated irreducible component $W$ of the first
characteristic variety $\V_1(M)$ are 1-admissible, see Proposition 3.1. The
same result holds for local systems on a translated component $W$, but now
$H^*(M,\C)$ should be replaced by $H^*(M_0,\C)$, where $M_0$ is a Zariski open
subset obtained from $M$ by deleting some hypersurfaces determined by the
translated component $W$, see Theorem 4.3.
"
What is the role of magnetic reconnection in the dynamics of coronal mass ejections (CMEs)?,"  It is generally believed that the magnetic free energy accumulated in the
corona serves as a main energy source for solar explosions such as coronal mass
ejections (CMEs). In the framework of the flux rope catastrophe model for CMEs,
the energy may be abruptly released either by an ideal magnetohydrodynamic
(MHD) catastrophe, which belongs to a global magnetic topological instability
of the system, or by a fast magnetic reconnection across preexisting or
rapidly-developing electric current sheets. Both ways of magnetic energy
release are thought to be important to CME dynamics. To disentangle their
contributions, we construct a flux rope catastrophe model in the corona and
solar wind and compare different cases in which we either prohibit or allow
magnetic reconnection to take place across rapidly-growing current sheets
during the eruption. It is demonstrated that CMEs, even fast ones, can be
produced taking the ideal MHD catastrophe as the only process of magnetic
energy release. Nevertheless, the eruptive speed can be significantly enhanced
after magnetic reconnection sets in. In addition, a smooth transition from slow
to fast eruptions is observed when increasing the strength of the background
magnetic field, simply because in a stronger field there is more free magnetic
energy at the catastrophic point available to be released during an eruption.
This suggests that fast and slow CMEs may have an identical driving mechanism.
"
What are the main physics topics in the MACRO experiment?,"  In this overview of the MACRO experiment we recall the structure of the
detector and discuss several physics topics: atmospheric neutrinos and neutrino
oscillations, high energy neutrino astronomy, searches for WIMPs and for low
energy stellar gravitational collapse neutrinos, stringent upper limits on GUT
magnetic monopoles, high energy downgoing muons, primary cosmic ray composition
and shadowing of primary cosmic rays by the Moon and the Sun.
"
What is the topological mechanism for generating mass for a bosonic p-tensor field in any spacetime dimension in abelian topologically massive gauge theories?,"  Abelian topologically massive gauge theories (TMGT) provide a topological
mechanism to generate mass for a bosonic p-tensor field in any spacetime
dimension. These theories include the 2+1 dimensional Maxwell-Chern-Simons and
3+1 dimensional Cremmer-Scherk actions as particular cases. Within the
Hamiltonian formulation, the embedded topological field theory (TFT) sector
related to the topological mass term is not manifest in the original phase
space. However through an appropriate canonical transformation, a gauge
invariant factorisation of phase space into two orthogonal sectors is feasible.
The first of these sectors includes canonically conjugate gauge invariant
variables with free massive excitations. The second sector, which decouples
from the total Hamiltonian, is equivalent to the phase space description of the
associated non dynamical pure TFT. Within canonical quantisation, a likewise
factorisation of quantum states thus arises for the full spectrum of TMGT in
any dimension. This new factorisation scheme also enables a definition of the
usual projection from TMGT onto topological quantum field theories in a most
natural and transparent way. None of these results rely on any gauge fixing
procedure whatsoever.
"
What are the key steps to extend Hartley's information formula to the generalized information formula?,"  Using fish-covering model, this paper intuitively explains how to extend
Hartley's information formula to the generalized information formula step by
step for measuring subjective information: metrical information (such as
conveyed by thermometers), sensory information (such as conveyed by color
vision), and semantic information (such as conveyed by weather forecasts). The
pivotal step is to differentiate condition probability and logical condition
probability of a message. The paper illustrates the rationality of the formula,
discusses the coherence of the generalized information formula and Popper's
knowledge evolution theory. For optimizing data compression, the paper
discusses rate-of-limiting-errors and its similarity to complexity-distortion
based on Kolmogorov's complexity theory, and improves the rate-distortion
theory into the rate-fidelity theory by replacing Shannon's distortion with
subjective mutual information. It is proved that both the rate-distortion
function and the rate-fidelity function are equivalent to a
rate-of-limiting-errors function with a group of fuzzy sets as limiting
condition, and can be expressed by a formula of generalized mutual information
for lossy coding, or by a formula of generalized entropy for lossless coding.
By analyzing the rate-fidelity function related to visual discrimination and
digitized bits of pixels of images, the paper concludes that subjective
information is less than or equal to objective (Shannon's) information; there
is an optimal matching point at which two kinds of information are equal; the
matching information increases with visual discrimination (defined by confusing
probability) rising; for given visual discrimination, too high resolution of
images or too much objective information is wasteful.
"
What is the bimetric coupling between the Riemann and Minkowski metrics in the relativistic theory of gravitation?,"  Starting with a field theoretic approach in Minkowski space, the
gravitational energy momentum tensor is derived from the Einstein equations in
a straightforward manner. This allows to present them as {\it acceleration
tensor} = const. $\times$ {\it total energy momentum tensor}. For flat space
cosmology the gravitational energy is negative and cancels the material energy.
In the relativistic theory of gravitation a bimetric coupling between the
Riemann and Minkowski metrics breaks general coordinate invariance. The case of
a positive cosmological constant is considered. A singularity free version of
the Schwarzschild black hole is solved analytically. In the interior the
components of the metric tensor quickly die out, but do not change sign,
leaving the role of time as usual. For cosmology the $\Lambda$CDM model is
covered, while there appears a form of inflation at early times. Here both the
total energy and the zero point energy vanish.
"
What is the full-image micro-PIV analysis in combination with images of transient particle motion used to measure in ferromagnetic microstrips?,"  We show that full-image micro-PIV analysis in combination with images of
transient particle motion is a powerful tool for experimental studies of
acoustic radiation forces and acoustic streaming in microfluidic chambers under
piezo-actuation in the MHz range. The measured steady-state motion of both
large 5 um and small 1 um particles can be understood in terms of the acoustic
eigenmodes or standing ultra-sound waves in the given experimental
microsystems. This interpretation is supported by numerical solutions of the
corresponding acoustic wave equation.
"
"What are the properties of Wilsonian effective actions, and how are they used to preserve gauge invariance in general and in supersymmetric gauge theories?","  We give a detailed critical discussion of the properties of Wilsonian
effective actions, defined by integrating out all modes above a given scale
$\mu$. In particular, we provide a precise and relatively convenient
prescription how to implement the infrared cutoff $\mu$ in any loop integral
that is manifestly Lorentz invariant and also preserves global linear
symmetries such as e.g. supersymmetry. We discuss the issue of gauge invariance
of effective actions in general and in particular when using background field
gauge. Our prescription for the IR cutoff (as any such prescription) breaks the
gauge symmetry. Using our prescription, we have explicitly computed, at one
loop, many terms of the Wilsonian effective action for general gauge theories,
involving bosonic and fermionic matter fields of arbitrary masses and in
arbitrary representations, exhibiting the non-gauge invariant (as well as the
gauge invariant) terms. However, for supersymmetric gauge theories all
non-gauge invariant terms cancel within each supermultiplet. This is strong
evidence that in supersymmetric gauge theories this indeed defines a Lorentz,
susy and gauge invariant Wilsonian effective action. As a byproduct, we obtain
the explicit one-loop Wilsonian couplings for all higher-derivative terms $F
D^{2n}F$ in the effective action of arbitrary supersymmetric gauge theories.
"
What is the relationship between two unital dual operator algebras A and B?,"  We prove that two unital dual operator algebras A, B are stably isomorphic if
and only if they are Delta-equivalent, if and only if they have completely
isometric normal representations a, b on Hilbert spaces H, K respectively and
there exists a ternary ring of operators M \subset B(H,K) such that a(A)=[M*
b(B) M]^{-w^*} and b(B)=[M a(A) M*]^{-w^*}.
"
What are the results for higher d-level cases of qutrits and qudits?,"  In this work we try to clarify the fundamental relationship between bits and
qubits, starting from very simple George Boole equation. We derive a generic
and compact expression for basis vectors of qubit which can be useful in
further applications. We also derive a generic form for the projection operator
in the quantum information space. The results are also extended to higher
d-level cases of qutrits and qudits.
"
What is the proof of the S-matrix in the Hopf algebra?,"  In 1999 A. Connes and D. Kreimer have discovered a Hopf algebra structure on
the Feynman graphs of scalar field theory. They have found that the
renormalization can be interpreted as a solving of some Riemann - Hilbert
problem. In this work the generalization of their scheme to the case of
nonabelian gauge theories is proposed. The action of the gauge group on the
Hopf algebra is defined and the proof that this action is in consistent with
the Hopf algebra structure is given. The scetch of new proof of S-matrix, based
on the Hopf algebra is given.
"
What are the two different deflation schemes proposed to cure the efficiency issue of the modified Arnoldi method?,"  The overlap Dirac operator in lattice QCD requires the computation of the
sign function of a matrix. While this matrix is usually Hermitian, it becomes
non-Hermitian in the presence of a quark chemical potential. We show how the
action of the sign function of a non-Hermitian matrix on an arbitrary vector
can be computed efficiently on large lattices by an iterative method. A Krylov
subspace approximation based on the Arnoldi algorithm is described for the
evaluation of a generic matrix function. The efficiency of the method is
spoiled when the matrix has eigenvalues close to a function discontinuity. This
is cured by adding a small number of critical eigenvectors to the Krylov
subspace, for which we propose two different deflation schemes. The ensuing
modified Arnoldi method is then applied to the sign function, which has a
discontinuity along the imaginary axis. The numerical results clearly show the
improved efficiency of the method. Our modification is particularly effective
when the action of the sign function of the same matrix has to be computed many
times on different vectors, e.g., if the overlap Dirac operator is inverted
using an iterative method.
"
What is the relationship between the parametrization of operator-valued frames and their dilation approach?,"  We develop a natural generalization of vector-valued frame theory, we term
operator-valued frame theory, using operator-algebraic methods. This extends
work of the second author and D. Han which can be viewed as the multiplicity
one case and extends to higher multiplicity (e.g., multiframes) their dilation
approach. We prove several results for operator-valued frames concerning their
parametrization, duality, disjointeness, complementarity, and composition and
the relationship between the two types of similarity (left and right) of such
frames. We then apply these notions to prove that the collection of multiframe
generators for the action of a discrete group on a Hilbert space is norm
pathwise-connected precisely when the von Neumann algebra generated by the
right representation of the group has no minimal projections. The proof is
obtained by parametrizing this collection by a class of partial isometries in a
larger von Neumann algebra. In the multiplicity one case this class reduces to
the unitary class which is path-connected in norm, but in the infinite
multiplicity case this class is path connected only in the strong operator
topology and the proof depends on properties of tensor product slice maps.
"
What are the transitions between these mechanisms?,"  In the presence of noncompact symmetry, the stability of relative equilibria
under momentum-preserving perturbations does not generally imply robust
stability under momentum-changing perturbations. For axisymmetric relative
equilibria of Hamiltonian systems with Euclidean symmetry, we investigate
different mechanisms of stability: stability by energy-momentum confinement,
KAM, and Nekhoroshev stability, and we explain the transitions between these.
We apply our results to the Kirchhoff model for the motion of an axisymmetric
underwater vehicle, and we numerically study dissipation induced instability of
KAM stable relative equilibria for this system.

What are the ingredients of a well-motivated particle theory beyond the electroweak Standard Model?,"  In this brief review we will discuss how a well motivated particle theory
beyond the eletroweak Standard Model provides ingredients and conditions for a
successful inflation. We will mainly focus on a low energy supersymmetric
Standard Model which provides plenty of scalars. In particular, these scalars
span a multidimensional moduli space of {\it gauge invariant} operators which
carry the Standard Model charges. The inflationary predictions which matches
the current observations are robust due to the fact that inflation occurs
within our own gauge sector where the couplings are well known. We further
argue that based on our current understandings if there exists a {\it string
landscape} of multiple vacua, then it is very natural that the last phase of
inflation would be driven by one of the many supersymmetric Standard Model
modulii. Only such a graceful exit from inflation would provide hot thermal
Standard Model baryons, cold dark matter, conditions for baryogenesis and
foremost the seed density perturbations for the cosmic microwave background
radiation in just {\it one package}. Furthermore we will also discuss how some
of the ingredients of inflation can be tested already by the LHC.

What are the advantages of using a submillimeter array with a cycle time of ~90 seconds?,"  For the submillimeter band observations, we have been routinely adopting the
calibration cycle time of 20-30 minutes, which is the same as any typical
centimeter and millimeter band observations. This cycle time, largely corrects
only the instrumental phase fluctuations and there exists residual phase
fluctuations, which are attributed to temporal and spatial atmospheric phase
fluctuations. Hence, the classical calibration cycle needs closer attention for
any future submillimeter band observations. We have therefore obtained
fast-switching test data, cycling between three nearby calibrators, using the
submillimeter array (SMA) with a cycle time of $\sim$90 sec, in order to
understand and optimize the calibration cycle suitably, thereby to achieve the
projected sensitivity, angular resolution and dynamic range for the SMA. Here,
we present the preliminary results from this study.
"
What is the implication of the Kramers-Kronig dispersion relation on the concept of causality?,"  It has been known for a long time that vacuum polarization in QED leads to a
superluminal low-frequency phase velocity for light propagating in curved
spacetime. Assuming the validity of the Kramers-Kronig dispersion relation,
this would imply a superluminal wavefront velocity and the violation of
causality. Here, we calculate for the first time the full frequency dependence
of the refractive index using world-line sigma model techniques together with
the Penrose plane wave limit of spacetime in the neighbourhood of a null
geodesic. We find that the high-frequency limit of the phase velocity (i.e. the
wavefront velocity) is always equal to c and causality is assured. However, the
Kramers-Kronig dispersion relation is violated due to a non-analyticity of the
refractive index in the upper-half complex plane, whose origin may be traced to
the generic focusing property of null geodesic congruences and the existence of
conjugate points. This puts into question the issue of micro-causality, i.e.
the vanishing of commutators of field operators at spacelike separated points,
in local quantum field theory in curved spacetime.
"
What are the unusual features of the optical and UV line emission in the quasar PHL 1811?,"  This is the second of two papers reporting observations and analysis of the
unusually bright (m_b=14.4), luminous (M_B=-25.5), nearby (z=0.192) narrow-line
quasar PHL 1811. The first paper reported that PHL 1811 is intrinsically X-ray
weak, and presented a spectral energy distribution (SED). Here we present HST
STIS optical and UV spectra, and ground-based optical spectra. The optical and
UV line emission is very unusual. There is no evidence for forbidden or
semiforbidden lines. The near-UV spectrum is dominated by very strong FeII and
FeIII, and unusual low-ionization lines such as NaID and CaII H&K are observed.
High-ionization lines are very weak; CIV has an equivalent width of 6.6A, a
factor of ~5 smaller than measured from quasar composite spectra. An unusual
feature near 1200A can be deblended in terms of Ly\alpha, NV, SiII, and CIII*
using the blueshifted CIV profile as a template. Photoionization modeling shows
that the unusual line emission can be explained qualitatively by the unusually
soft SED. Principally, a low gas temperature results in inefficient emission of
collisionally excited lines, including the semiforbidden lines generally used
as density diagnostics. The emission resembles that of high-density gas; in
both cases this is a consequence of inefficient cooling. PHL 1811 is very
unusual, but we note that quasar surveys are generally biased against finding
similar objects.
"
How do the authors explain the observed slopes in the radial gradient of the mean stellar [alpha/Fe] ratio in elliptical galaxies?,"  The scope of this paper is two-fold: i) to test and improve our previous
models of an outside-in formation for the majority of ellipticals in the
context of the SN-driven wind scenario, by means of a careful study of gas
inflows/outflows; ii) to explain the observed slopes, either positive or
negative, in the radial gradient of the mean stellar [alpha/Fe], and their
apparent lack of any correlation with all the other observables. In order to
pursue these goals we present a new class of hydrodynamical simulations for the
formation of single elliptical galaxies in which we implement detailed
prescriptions for the chemical evolution of H, He, O and Fe. We find that all
the models which predict chemical properties (such as the central mass-weighted
abundance ratios, the colours as well as the [<Fe/H>] gradient) within the
observed ranges for a typical elliptical, also exhibit a variety of gradients
in the [<alpha/Fe>] ratio, in agreement with the observations (namely positive,
null or negative). All these models undergo an outside-in formation, in the
sense that star formation stops earlier in the outermost than in the innermost
regions, owing to the onset of a galactic wind. The typical [<Z/H>] gradients
predicted by our models have a slope of -0.3 dex per decade variation in
radius, consistent with the mean values of several observational samples. We
can safely conclude that the history of star formation is fundamental for the
creation of abundance gradients in ellipticals but that radial flows with
different velocity in conjunction with the duration and efficiency of star
formation in different galactic regions are responsible for the gradients in
the [<alpha/Fe>] ratios.
"
What are the symmetries preserved by the CSL state?,"  We establish the existence of a chiral spin liquid (CSL) as the exact ground
state of the Kitaev model on a decorated honeycomb lattice, which is obtained
by replacing each site in the familiar honeycomb lattice with a triangle. The
CSL state spontaneously breaks time reversal symmetry but preserves other
symmetries. There are two topologically distinct CSLs separated by a quantum
critical point. Interestingly, vortex excitations in the topologically
nontrivial (Chern number $\pm 1$) CSL obey non-Abelian statistics.
"
What are the theoretical frameworks for factorization approaches to exclusive B meson decays?,"  We compare the theoretical frameworks and the phenomenological applications
of the factorization approaches to exclusive $B$ meson decays, which include
QCD-improved factorization, perturbative QCD, and soft-collinear effective
theory. Recent progress on two-body nonleptonic $B$ meson decays made in these
approaches are reviewed.
"
How accurate are the ages derived via gyrochronology for late-type main sequence stars?,"  We here develop an improved way of using a rotating star as a clock, set it
using the Sun, and demonstrate that it keeps time well. This technique, called
gyrochronology, permits the derivation of ages for solar- and late-type main
sequence stars using only their rotation periods and colors. The technique is
clarified and developed here, and used to derive ages for illustrative groups
of nearby, late-type field stars with measured rotation periods. We first
demonstrate the reality of the interface sequence, the unifying feature of the
rotational observations of cluster and field stars that makes the technique
possible, and extends it beyond the proposal of Skumanich by specifying the
mass dependence of rotation for these stars. We delineate which stars it cannot
currently be used on. We then calibrate the age dependence using the Sun. The
errors are propagated to understand their dependence on color and period.
Representative age errors associated with the technique are estimated at ~15%
(plus possible systematic errors) for late-F, G, K, & early-M stars. Ages
derived via gyrochronology for the Mt. Wilson stars are shown to be in good
agreement with chromospheric ages for all but the bluest stars, and probably
superior. Gyro ages are then calculated for each of the active main sequence
field stars studied by Strassmeier and collaborators where other ages are not
available. These are shown to be mostly younger than 1Gyr, with a median age of
365Myr. The sample of single, late-type main sequence field stars assembled by
Pizzolato and collaborators is then assessed, and shown to have gyro ages
ranging from under 100Myr to several Gyr, and a median age of 1.2Gyr. Finally,
we demonstrate that the individual components of the three wide binaries
XiBooAB, 61CygAB, & AlphaCenAB yield substantially the same gyro ages.
"
What is the multiobjective optimization of the Slide-o-Cam mechanism?,"  The multiobjective optimization of Slide-o-Cam is reported in this paper.
Slide-o-Cam is a cam mechanism with multiple rollers mounted on a common
translating follower. This transmission provides pure-rolling motion, thereby
reducing the friction of rack-and-pinions and linear drives. A Pareto frontier
is obtained by means of multiobjective optimization. This optimization is based
on three objective functions: (i) the pressure angle, which is a suitable
performance index for the transmission because it determines the amount of
force transmitted to the load vs. that transmitted to the machine frame; (ii)
the Hertz pressure used to evaluate the stresses produced on the contact
surface between cam and roller; and (iii) the size of the mechanism,
characterized by the number of cams and their width.
"
What is the significance of the mapping between the XRT and UVOT detectors?,"  Here we describe an autonomous way of producing more accurate prompt XRT
positions for Swift-detected GRBs and their afterglows, based on UVOT
astrometry and a detailed mapping between the XRT and UVOT detectors. The
latter significantly reduces the dominant systematic error -- the star-tracker
solution to the World Coordinate System. This technique, which is limited to
times when there is significant overlap between UVOT and XRT PC-mode data,
provides a factor of 2 improvement in the localisation of XRT refined positions
on timescales of less than a few hours. Furthermore, the accuracy achieved is
superior to astrometrically corrected XRT PC mode images at early times (for up
to 24 hours), for the majority of bursts, and is comparable to the accuracy
achieved by astrometrically corrected X-ray positions based on deep XRT PC-mode
imaging at later times (abridged).
"
What is the symplectic group Sp_{2g}(Z/\ell) when g>=3 and \ell is a prime distinct from p?,"  We compute the Z/\ell and \ell-adic monodromy of every irreducible component
of the moduli space M_g^f of curves of genus and and p-rank f. In particular,
we prove that the Z/\ell-monodromy of every component of M_g^f is the
symplectic group Sp_{2g}(Z/\ell) if g>=3 and \ell is a prime distinct from p.
We give applications to the generic behavior of automorphism groups, Jacobians,
class groups, and zeta functions of curves of given genus and p-rank.
"
What are the constraints on the ratio between the k^3 component and the nearly scale-invariant component in the power spectrum?,"  Well-known causality arguments show that events occurring during or at the
end of inflation, associated with reheating or preheating, could contribute a
blue component to the spectrum of primordial curvature perturbations, with the
dependence k^3. We explore the possibility that they could be observably large
in CMB, LSS, and Lyman-alpha data. We find that a k^3 component with a cutoff
at some maximum k can modestly improve the fits (Delta chi^2=2.0, 5.4) of the
low multipoles (l ~ 10 - 50) or the second peak (l ~ 540) of the CMB angular
spectrum when the three-year WMAP data are used. Moreover, the results from
WMAP are consistent with the CBI, ACBAR, 2dFGRS, and SDSS data when they are
included in the analysis. Including the SDSS galaxy clustering power spectrum,
we find weak positive evidence for the k^3 component at the level of Delta chi'
= 2.4, with the caveat that the nonlinear evolution of the power spectrum may
not be properly treated in the presence of the k^3 distortion. To investigate
the high-k regime, we use the Lyman-alpha forest data (LUQAS, Croft et al., and
SDSS Lyman-alpha); here we find evidence at the level Delta chi^2' = 3.8.
Considering that there are two additional free parameters in the model, the
above results do not give a strong evidence for features; however, they show
that surprisingly large bumps are not ruled out. We give constraints on the
ratio between the k^3 component and the nearly scale-invariant component, r_3 <
1.5, over the range of wave numbers 0.0023/Mpc < k < 8.2/Mpc. We also discuss
theoretical models which could lead to the k^3 effect, including ordinary
hybrid inflation and double D-term inflation models. We show that the
well-motivated k^3 component is also a good representative of the generic
spikelike feature in the primordial perturbation power spectrum.
"
What is the significance of the AU Microscopii debris disk in the context of disk evolution across different spectral types?,"  (abridged) Debris disks around main sequence stars are produced by the
erosion and evaporation of unseen parent bodies. AU Microscopii (GJ 803) is a
compelling object to study in the context of disk evolution across different
spectral types, as it is an M dwarf whose near edge-on disk may be directly
compared to that of its A5V sibling beta Pic. We resolve the disk from 8-60 AU
in the near-IR JHK' bands at high resolution with the Keck II telescope and
adaptive optics, and develop a novel data reduction technique for the removal
of the stellar point spread function. The point source detection sensitivity in
the disk midplane is more than a magnitude less sensitive than regions away
from the disk for some radii. We measure a blue color across the near-IR bands,
and confirm the presence of substructure in the inner disk. Some of the
structural features exhibit wavelength-dependent positions. The disk
architecture and characteristics of grain composition are inferred through
modeling. We approach the modeling of the dust distribution in a manner that
complements previous work. Using a Monte Carlo radiative transfer code, we
compare a relatively simple model of the distribution of porous grains to a
broad data set, simultaneously fitting to midplane surface brightness profiles
and the spectral energy distribution. Our model confirms that the large-scale
architecture of the disk is consistent with detailed models of steady-state
grain dynamics. Here, a belt of parent bodies from 35-40 AU is responsible for
producing dust that is then swept outward by the stellar wind and radiation
pressures. We infer the presence of very small grains in the outer region, down
to sizes of ~0.05 micron. These sizes are consistent with stellar mass-loss
rates Mdot_* << 10^2 Mdot_sun.
"
What are the constraints on the agegraphic dark energy model using Type Ia supernovae data?,"  In this paper, we use the Type Ia supernova data as well as the CMB and LSS
data to constrain the agegraphic dark energy model recently proposed by Cai.
Due to its peculiar nature, the parameter $n$ of this model cannot be well
constrained by the SNIa data, while the other parameter $\Omega_{m0}$ can be
constrained to be $0.34\pm0.04$. When combined with CMB and LSS data, the range
of $1\sigma$ confidence level for $n$ is greatly narrowed, albeit still very
large. The best fit result is $\Omega_{m0}=0.28\pm0.02$, which is consistent
with most observations like WMAP and SDSS, and $n=3.4$, of which a meaningful
range of confidence level can not be obtained due to the fact that the contours
are not closed. Despite of this result, we conclude that for $n>1$ this model
is consistent with SNIa, CMB and LSS observations. Furthermore, the fitting
results indicate a generalized definition for the agegraphic dark energy.
"
What are the implications of the size-dependent cumulative advantage for the impact of universities in terms of total number of citations?,"  For the 100 largest European universities we studied the statistical
properties of bibliometric indicators related to research performance, field
citation density and journal impact. We find a size-dependent cumulative
advantage for the impact of universities in terms of total number of citations.
In previous work a similar scaling rule was found at the level of research
groups. Therefore we conjecture that this scaling rule is a prevalent property
of the science system. We observe that lower performance universities have a
larger size-dependent cumulative advantage for receiving citations than
top-performance universities. We also find that for the lower-performance
universities the fraction of not-cited publications decreases considerably with
size. Generally, the higher the average journal impact of the publications of a
university, the lower the number of not-cited publications. We find that the
average research performance does not dilute with size. Large top-performance
universities succeed in keeping a high performance over a broad range of
activities. This most probably is an indication of their scientific attractive
power. Next we find that particularly for the lower-performance universities
the field citation density provides a strong cumulative advantage in citations
per publication. The relation between number of citations and field citation
density found in this study can be considered as a second basic scaling rule of
the science system. Top-performance universities publish in journals with
significantly higher journal impact as compared to the lower performance
universities. We find a significant decrease of the fraction of self-citations
with increasing research performance, average field citation density, and
average journal impact.
"
What are the implications of the cohomology of the intersection of a definable decreasing family of definably compact sets?,"  We prove that the cohomology groups of a definably compact set over an
o-minimal expansion of a group are finitely generated and invariant under
elementary extensions and expansions of the language. We also study the
cohomology of the intersection of a definable decreas-ing family of definably
compact sets, under the additional assumption that the o-minimal structure
expands a field.
"
What is the multipartite entanglement of a superposition in terms of the entanglement of the superposed states and the superposition coefficients?,"  The entanglement of superpositions [Phys. Rev. Lett. 97, 100502 (2006)] is
generalized to the multipartite scenario: an upper bound to the multipartite
entanglement of a superposition is given in terms of the entanglement of the
superposed states and the superposition coefficients. This bound is proven to
be tight for a class of states composed by an arbitrary number of qubits. We
also extend the result to a large family of quantifiers which includes the
negativity, the robustness of entanglement, and the best separable
approximation measure.
"
What are the conditions under which the subspace of H^2(M;Z_2) spanned by the image of the cup product has dimension at most 1?,"  Let M be a complete, finite-volume, orientable hyperbolic manifold having
exactly one cusp. If we assume that pi_1(M) has no subgroup isomorphic to a
genus-2 surface group, and that either (a) H_1(M;Z_p) has dimension at least 5
for some prime p, or (b) H_1(M;Z_2) has dimension at least 4, and the subspace
of H^2(M;Z_2) spanned by the image of the cup product has dimension at most 1,
then vol M > 5.06 If we assume that H_1(M;Z_2) has dimension at least 7, and
that the compact core of M does not contain a genus-2 closed incompressible
surface, then vol M > 5.06.
"
What is the branching ratio of B → J/Ψ η in the B → J/Ψ η decay?,"  We study $B\to J/\Psi \eta^{(\prime)}$ decays and suggest two methods to
determine the $\eta-\eta^{\prime}$ mixing angle. We calculate not only the
factorizable contribution in QCD facorization scheme but also the
nonfactorizable hard spectator corrections in pQCD approach. We get the
branching ratio of $B\to J/\Psi \eta$ which is consistent with recent
experimental data and predict the branching ratio of $B\to J/\Psi
\eta^{\prime}$ to be $7.59\times 10^{-6}$. Two methods for determining
$\eta-\eta^{\prime}$ mixing angle are suggested in this paper. For the first
method, we get the $\eta-\eta^{\prime}$ mixing angle to be about
$-13.1^{\circ}$, which is in consistency with others in the literature. The
second method depends on less parameters so can be used to determine the
$\eta-\eta^{\prime}$ mixing angle with better accuracy but needs, as an input,
the branching ratio for $B\to J/\Psi \eta^{\prime}$which should be measured in
the near future.
"
What are the implications of a charged massive particle big bang nucleosynthesis (CBBN) on the nature of the reheating of the Universe?,"  We discuss the impact of charged massive particle big bang
nucleosynthesis(CBBN) to explore the nature of the reheating of the Universe in
the case that a new extremely long-lived charged massive particle(CHAMP)
exists. If the mass of the CHAMP is within collider reach and it's lifetime is
longer than $10^4$sec, the comparison between the CBBN prediction and observed
$^6$Li abundances may indicate nonstandard reheating in the early Universe
without relying on details of the decay properties. Even if the CHAMP mass is
outside the reach of colliders, the cosmological considerations may provide a
nontrivial hint for the existence of such very heavy long-lived CHAMPs from the
late Universe if the daughter particles are the dominant component of the
present dark matter. We consider a low reheating temperature model as an
example of the nonstandard reheating scenarios.
"
What is the dynamical exponent in the fully-frustrated Ising model estimated at equilibrium?,"  We study the dynamics of the critical two-dimensional fully-frustrated Ising
model by means of Monte Carlo simulations. The dynamical exponent is estimated
at equilibrium and is shown to be compatible with the value $z_c=2$. In a
second step, the system is prepared in the paramagnetic phase and then quenched
at its critical temperature $T_c=0$. Numerical evidences for the existence of
logarithmic corrections in the aging regime are presented. These corrections
may be related to the topological defects observed in other fully-frustrated
models. The autocorrelation exponent is estimated to be $\lambda=d$ as for the
Ising chain quenched at $T_c=0$.
"
"What is the probability that a random polynomial has exactly k real roots in [0,1]?","  We consider a class of real random polynomials, indexed by an integer d, of
large degree n and focus on the number of real roots of such random
polynomials. The probability that such polynomials have no real root in the
interval [0,1] decays as a power law n^{-\theta(d)} where \theta(d)>0 is the
exponent associated to the decay of the persistence probability for the
diffusion equation with random initial conditions in space dimension d. For n
even, the probability that such polynomials have no root on the full real axis
decays as n^{-2(\theta(d) + \theta(2))}. For d=1, this connection allows for a
physical realization of real random polynomials. We further show that the
probability that such polynomials have exactly k real roots in [0,1] has an
unusual scaling form given by n^{-\tilde \phi(k/\log n)} where \tilde \phi(x)
is a universal large deviation function.
"
What is the effect of absorptive corrections on the azimuthal angle distributions in $J/\psi$ photoproduction in proton-proton and proton-antiproton collisions?,"  Protons and antiprotons at collider energies are a source of high energy
Weizs\""acker--Williams photons. This may open a possibility to study exclusive
photoproduction of heavy vector mesons at energies much larger than possible at
the HERA accelerator. Here we present a detailed investigation of the exclusive
$J/\psi$ photoproduction in proton-proton (RHIC, LHC) and proton-antiproton
(Tevatron) collisions. We calculate several differential distributions in $t_1,
t_2, y, \phi$, as well as transverse momentum distributions of $J/\Psi$'s. We
discuss correlations in the azimuthal angle between outgoing protons or proton
and antiproton as well as in the ($t_1, t_2$) space. Differently from
electroproduction experiments, here both colliding beam particles can be a
source of photons, and we find large interference terms in azimuthal angle
distributions in a broad range of rapidities of the produced meson. We also
include the spin--flip parts in the electromagnetic vertices. We discuss the
effect of absorptive corrections on various distributions. Interestingly,
absorption corrections induce a charge asymmetry in rapidity distributions, and
are larger for $p p$ reactions than for the $p \bar p$ case. The reaction
considered here constitutes an important nonreduceable background in recently
proposed searches for odderon exchange.
"
What is the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) used in the analysis?,"  We perform a comprehensive analysis of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard
Model (MSSM) in the scenario where the scalar partners of the fermions and the
Higgs particles (except for the Standard-Model-like one) are assumed to be very
heavy and are removed from the low-energy spectrum. We first summarize our
determination of the mass spectrum, in which we include the one-loop radiative
corrections and resum to all orders the leading logarithms of the large scalar
masses, and describe the implementation of these features in the FORTRAN code
SuSpect which calculates the masses and couplings of the MSSM particles. We
then study in detail the phenomenology of the model in scenarios where the
gaugino mass parameters are non-universal at the GUT scale, which leads to very
interesting features that are not present in the widely studied case of
universal gaugino mass parameters. We discuss the constraints from collider
searches and high-precision measurements, the cosmological constraints on the
relic abundance of the neutralino candidate for the Dark Matter in the Universe
- where new and interesting channels for neutralino annihilation appear - and
the gluino lifetime. We then analyze, in the case of non-universal gaugino
masses, the decays of the Higgs boson (in particular decays into and
contributions of SUSY particles), of charginos and neutralinos (in particular
decays into Higgs bosons and photons) and of gluinos, and highlight the
differences from the case of universal gaugino masses.
"
How does the shape of a hole array affect the optical transmission in a ferromagnet?,"  Influence of hole shape on extraordinary optical transmission was
investigated using hole arrays consisting of rectangular holes with different
aspect ratio. It was found that the transmission could be tuned continuously by
rotating the hole array. Further more, a phase was generated in this process,
and linear polarization states could be changed to elliptical polarization
states. This phase was correlated with the aspect ratio of the holes. An
intuitional model was presented to explain these results.
"
What is the relationship between the Euler characteristic and the Euler characteristic for a closed connected smooth manifold?,"  A classical theorem of H. Hopf asserts that a closed connected smooth
manifold admits a nowhere vanishing vector field if and only if its Euler
characteristic is zero. R. Brown generalized Hopf's result to topological
manifolds, replacing vector fields with path fields. In this note, we give an
equivariant analog of Brown's theorem for locally smooth $G$-manifolds where
$G$ is a finite group.
"
What are the implications of the Affleck-Dine mechanism for the universe?,"  In some models of supersymmetry breaking, modulus fields are heavy enough to
decay before BBN. But the large entropy produced via moduli decay significantly
dilutes the preexisting baryon asymmetry of the universe. We study whether
Affleck-Dine mechanism can provide enough baryon asymmetry which survives the
dilution, and find several situations in which desirable amount of baryon
number remains after the dilution. The possibility of non-thermal dark matter
is also discussed. This provides the realistic cosmological scenario with heavy
moduli.
"
What is the possible origin of the V-type asteroids in the middle belt?,"  The recent discovery of the first V-type asteroid in the middle belt, (21238)
1995WV7, located at ~2.54 AU, raises the question of whether it came from (4)
Vesta or not. In this paper, we present spectroscopic observations indicating
the existence of another V-type asteroid at ~2.53 AU, (40521) 1999RL95, and we
investigate the possibility that these two asteroids evolved from the Vesta
family to their present orbits by drifting in semi-major axis due to the
Yarkovsky effect. The main problem with this scenario is that the asteroids
need to cross the 3/1 mean motion resonance with Jupiter, which is highly
unstable. Combining numerical simulations of the orbital evolution, that
include the Yarkovsky effect, with Monte Carlo models, we compute the
probability of an asteroid of given diameter D to evolve from the Vesta family
and to cross over the 3/1 resonance, reaching a stable orbit in the middle
belt. Our results indicate that an asteroid like (21238) 1995WV7 has a low
probability of having evolved through this mechanism due to its large size (~5
km). However, the mechanism might explain the orbit of smaller bodies like
(40521) 1999RL95 (~3 km), provided that we assume that the Vesta family formed
> 3.5 Gy ago. We estimate that about 10% or more of the V-type bodies with D>1
km may come from the Vesta family by crossing over the 3/1 resonance. The
remaining 90% must have a different origin.
"
What is the Diophantine condition for the spectral action on noncommutative torus?,"  The spectral action on noncommutative torus is obtained, using a
Chamseddine--Connes formula via computations of zeta functions. The importance
of a Diophantine condition is outlined. Several results on holomorphic
continuation of series of holomorphic functions are obtained in this context.
"
What is the concept of the nonrelativistic phase of afterglows in the context of $\gamma$-ray bursts?,"  The discovery of multiband afterglows definitely shows that most $\gamma$-ray
bursts are of cosmological origin. $\gamma$-ray bursts are found to be one of
the most violent explosive phenomena in the Universe, in which astonishing
ultra-relativistic motions are involved. In this article, the multiband
observational characteristics of $\gamma$-ray bursts and their afterglows are
briefly reviewed. The standard model of $\gamma$-ray bursts, i.e. the fireball
model, is described. Emphasis is then put on the importance of the
nonrelativistic phase of afterglows. The concept of deep Newtonian phase is
elaborated. A generic dynamical model that is applicable in both the
relativistic and nonrelativistic phases is introduced. Based on these
elaborations, the overall afterglow behaviors, from the very early stages to
the very late stages, can be conveniently calculated.
"
Can perturbative supergravity be decoupled from string theory in d > 3 dimensions?,"  We consider the conditions necessary for obtaining perturbative maximal
supergravity in d dimensions as a decoupling limit of type II superstring
theory compactified on a (10 -- d)-torus. For dimensions d = 2 and d = 3 it is
possible to define a limit in which the only finite-mass states are the 256
massless states of maximal supergravity. However, in dimensions d > 3 there are
infinite towers of additional massless and finite-mass states. These correspond
to Kaluza--Klein charges, wound strings, Kaluza--Klein monopoles or branes
wrapping around cycles of the toroidal extra dimensions. We conclude that
perturbative supergravity cannot be decoupled from string theory in dimensions
d > 3. In particular, we conjecture that pure N = 8 supergravity in four
dimensions is in the Swampland.
"
What is the relationship between the strong and weak conditions for the transition of a quantum system?,"  We contrast two sets of conditions that govern the transition in which
classical dynamics emerges from the evolution of a quantum system. The first
was derived by considering the trajectories seen by an observer (dubbed the
``strong'' transition) [Bhattacharya, et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 85: 4852
(2000)], and the second by considering phase-space densities (the ``weak''
transition) [Greenbaum, et al., Chaos 15, 033302 (2005)]. On the face of it
these conditions appear rather different. We show, however, that in the
semiclassical regime, in which the action of the system is large compared to
$\hbar$, and the measurement noise is small, they both offer an essentially
equivalent local picture. Within this regime, the weak conditions dominate
while in the opposite regime where the action is not much larger than Planck's
constant, the strong conditions dominate.
"
What is the concept of time-consistency in the context of coherent risk measures?,"  We consider the problem of representing claims for coherent risk measures.
For this purpose we introduce the concept of (weak and strong) time-consistency
with respect to a portfolio of assets, generalizing the one defined by Delbaen.
  In a similar way we extend the notion of m-stability, by introducing weak and
strong versions. We then prove that the two concepts of m-stability and
time-consistency are still equivalent, thus giving necessary and sufficient
conditions for a coherent risk measure to be represented by a market with
proportional transaction costs. We go on to deduce that, under a separability
assumption, any coherent risk measure is strongly time-consistent with respect
to a suitably chosen countable portfolio, and show the converse: that any
market with proportional transaction costs is equivalent to a market priced by
a coherent risk measure, essentially establishing the equivalence of the two
concepts.
"
What are the effects of magnetic fields on the accretion rate of a black hole?,"  Many models of gamma-ray bursts suggest a common central engine: a black hole
of several solar masses accreting matter from a disk at an accretion rate from
0.01 to 10 M_\sun / s. The inner region of the disk is cooled by neutrino
emission and large amounts of its binding energy were liberated, which could
trigger the fireball. We improve the neutrino-dominated accreting flows by
considering the effects of the magnetic fields, and find that more than half of
the liberating energy can be extracted directly by the large-scale magnetic
fields on the disk. And it turns out that the temperature of the disk is a bit
lower than the neutrino-dominated accreting flows without magnetic field.
Therefore, The outflows are magneticallydominated rather than neutrino
dominated. In our model, neutrino mechanism can fuel some GRBs (not the
brightest ones), but cannot fuel X-ray flares. However, the magnetic processes
(both BZ and electromagnetic luminosity from a disk) are viable mechanisms for
most of GRBs and the following X-ray flares.

"What is the DOEF, and how does it facilitate dynamic object evaluation?","  In object-oriented or object-relational databases such as multimedia
databases or most XML databases, access patterns are not static, i.e.,
applications do not always access the same objects in the same order
repeatedly. However, this has been the way these databases and associated
optimisation techniques like clustering have been evaluated up to now. This
paper opens up research regarding this issue by proposing a dynamic object
evaluation framework (DOEF) that accomplishes access pattern change by defining
configurable styles of change. This preliminary prototype has been designed to
be open and fully extensible. To illustrate the capabilities of DOEF, we used
it to compare the performances of four state of the art dynamic clustering
algorithms. The results show that DOEF is indeed effective at determining the
adaptability of each dynamic clustering algorithm to changes in access pattern.
"
What is the role of the delta isobar in the reaction πd→πd at threshold in chiral effective field theory?,"  We investigate the role of the delta isobar in the reaction $\pi d\to \pi d$
at threshold in chiral effective field theory. We discuss the corresponding
power counting and argue that this calculation completes the evaluation of
diagrams up to the order (m_pi/M_N)^(3/2), with m_pi (M_N) for the pion
(nucleon) mass. The net effect of all delta contributions at this order to the
pion-deuteron scattering length is (2.4 +/- 0.4)x 10^(-3) m_pi^{-1}.
"
What are the implications of the toroidal embedding on the polyhedral divisor?,"  Given an effective action of an (n-1)-dimensional torus on an n-dimensional
normal affine variety, Mumford constructs a toroidal embedding, while Altmann
and Hausen give a description in terms of a polyhedral divisor on a curve. We
compare the fan of the toroidal embedding with this polyhedral divisor.
"
What is the relationship between the integral recursion operator for the generalized Givental representation and the degenerate Q-operator for Toda chains?,"  We propose integral representations of the Whittaker functions for the
classical Lie algebras sp(2l), so(2l) and so(2l+1). These integral
representations generalize the integral representation of gl(l+1)-Whittaker
functions first introduced by Givental. One of the salient features of the
Givental representation is its recursive structure with respect to the rank of
the Lie algebra gl(l+1). The proposed generalization of the Givental
representation to the classical Lie algebras retains this property. It was
shown elsewhere that the integral recursion operator for gl(l+1)-Whittaker
function in the Givental representation coincides with a degeneration of the
Baxter Q-operator for $\hat{gl(l+1)}$-Toda chains. We construct Q-operator for
affine Lie algebras $\hat{so(2l)}$, $\hat{so(2l+1)}$ and a twisted form of
$\hat{gl(2l)}$. We demonstrate that the relation between recursion integral
operators of the generalized Givental representation and degenerate Q-operators
remains valid for all classical Lie algebras.
"
How are Wilson loops in N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory related to minimal surfaces in AdS_5?,"  We study an anisotropic scale transformation in the worldsheet description of
D3-branes in Type IIB theory, and show that the transformation is really a
symmetry in a region near D3-branes. AdS/CFT correspondence follows from this
symmetry. We will explicitly show that Wilson loops in N=4 supersymmetric
Yang-Mills theory and minimal surfaces in AdS_5 are related by the symmetry.
The functional form of a supersymmetric Wilson loop operator is naturally
derived from our worldsheet point of view.
"
What was the scientific problem that had intrigued the speaker and Eduardo Delgado?,"  Eduardo Delgado was due to have presented a poster at this meeting on his
latest results on the formation of extreme mass ratio binaries. Tragically,
Eduardo was among those killed in a hiking accident in Tenerife earlier this
year. As his PhD supervisor, and as a longstanding collaborator, the organisers
of this meeting kindly invited me to incorporate a report on his most recent
work into a more general tribute to his life and work.
  I will reflect on Eduardo's scientific career, the problems that motivated
him and his achievements, focusing particularly on a problem which had
intrigued us both for several years and on which Eduardo was making important
progress at the time of his death. Finally, I will mention the personal
qualities that Eduardo brought to his work and the acute sense of loss that is
shared by all those - friends and collaborators - who were privileged to know
him.
"
What is the combined hydrodynamics and perturbative QCD approach used to predict the Pb-Pb spectra in Pb-Pb collisions?,"  The single inclusive charged hadron pT spectra in Pb-Pb collisions at the
LHC, predicted by a combined hydrodynamics+perturbative QCD (pQCD) approach are
presented.
"
What is the geometric property of a transcendental entire function f?,"  A transcendental entire function f is called geometrically finite if the
intersection of the set of singular values with the Fatou set is compact and
the intersection of the postsingular set with the Julia set is finite. (In
particular, this includes all entire functions with finite postsingular set.)
If f is geometrically finite, then the Fatou set of f is either empty or
consists of the basins of attraction of finitely many attracting or parabolic
cycles.
  Let z_0 be a repelling or parabolic periodic point of such a map f. We show
that, if f has finite order, then there exists an injective curve consisting of
escaping points of f that connects z_0 to infinity. (This curve is called a
dynamic ray.) In fact, the assumption of finite order can be weakened
considerably; for example, it is sufficient to assume that f can be written as
a finite composition of finite-order functions.
"
What are the general integral formulas for probabilities in the asymmetric simple exclusion process (ASEP)?,"  In this paper we obtain general integral formulas for probabilities in the
asymmetric simple exclusion process (ASEP) on the integer lattice with nearest
neighbor hopping rates p to the right and q=1-p to the left. For the most part
we consider an N-particle system but for certain of these formulas we can take
the limit as N goes to infinity. First we obtain, for the N-particle system, a
formula for the probability of a configuration at time t, given the initial
configuration. For this we use Bethe Ansatz ideas to solve the master equation,
extending a result of Schuetz for the case N=2. The main results of the paper,
derived from this, are integral formulas for the probability, for given initial
configuration, that the m'th left-most particle is at x at time t. In one of
these formulas we can take the limit as N goes to infinity, and it gives the
probability for an infinite system where the initial configuration is bounded
on one side. For the special case of the totally asymmetric simple exclusion
process (TASEP) our formulas reduce to the known ones.
"
What is the feasibility of the subthreshold photoproduction of φ mesons from heavy nuclear targets?,"  The subthreshold photoproduction of \phi mesons from heavy nuclear targets
has been suggested as a candidate to search for the \phi-N bound state, a
quantum chromodynamics molecular state. In this Brief Report, we present
detailed Monte Carlo studies to demonstrate the feasibility of this technique.
Further, we show that proton-induced subthreshold production of \phi meson from
heavy nuclear targets is also suitable for such a search.
"
What are the crossovers out of the quantum critical region?,"  We describe the thermal and electrical conductivities of quasi-one
dimensional wires, across a quantum phase transition from a superconductor to a
metal induced by pairbreaking perturbations. Fluctuation corrections to BCS
theory motivate a field theory for quantum criticality. We describe deviations
in the Wiedemann-Franz ratio from the Lorenz number, which can act as sensitive
tests of the theory. We also describe the crossovers out of the quantum
critical region into the metallic and superconducting phases.
"
What are the four causal classes of frames in Newtonian space-time?,"  In Newtonian space-time there exist four, and only four, causal classes of
frames. Natural frames allow to extend this result to coordinate systems, so
that coordinate systems may be also locally classified in four causal classes.
These causal classes admit simple geometric descriptions and physical
interpretations. For example, one can generate representatives of the four
causal classes by means of the {\em linear synchronization group}. Of
particular interest is the {\em local Solar time synchronization}, which
reveals the limits of the frequent use of the concept of `causally oriented
oordinate', such as that of `time-like coordinate'. Classical {\em positioning
systems}, based in sound or light signals, are, by themselves, interesting
examples of location systems, i.e. of physically constructible coordinate
systems. They show that one can locate events in Newtonian space-time {\em
without} any use of the concept of synchronization. In fact, the coordinate
systems associated to positioning systems, belong to all the classes but the
standard one, i.e. the one based in the simultaneity synchronization. The
relativistic analogs of these examples, emphasize the contrast between the four
Newtonian and the one hundred and ninety nine Lorentzian causal classes of
frames of classical and relativistic space-times, respectively.
"
What is the variational formulation for the solution of the effective two-level approach of the analysis of electron localization in two coupled quantum dots?,"  Analysis of quantum dot structures is a current topic with important
applications in solid-state digital logic design, quantum information
technology and quantum optics. In this work, we show a variational formulation
for the solution of the effective two-level approach of the analysis of
electron localization in two coupled quantum dots. Numerical results are
presented as well the use of electron localization in the realization of a
configurable logic circuit using quantum-dot cellular automata.
"
What are the thermal states in the thermal closed string excitations in anti-de Sitter spacetime within the TFD approach?,"  We determine the local entropy of the free energy of the quantized open
bosonic string in Minkowski spacetime with the most general boundary
conditions. We formulate a finite temperature theory of the thermal closed
string excitations in anti-de Sitter spacetime within the TFD approach. We
write down the thermal states and obtain the entropy and the free energy in the
first order expansion of the semiclassical quantization in the center of mass
reference frame.
"
What is the role of the mean-field description in the homogenization limit of a Stefan problem?,"  We rigorously derive a weak form of the Lifshitz-Slyozov-Wagner equation as
the homogenization limit of a Stefan-type problem describing
reaction-controlled coarsening of a large number of small spherical particles.
Moreover, we deduce that the effective mean-field description holds true in the
particular limit of vanishing surface-area density of particles.
"
What are the assumptions in the Laplacian comparison theorem?,"  We prove a version of Yau's Schwarz Lemma for general almost-complex
manifolds equipped with Hermitian metrics. This requires an extension to this
setting of the Laplacian comparison theorem. As an application we show that the
product of two almost-complex manifolds does not admit any complete Hermitian
metric with bisectional curvature bounded between two negative constants that
satisfies some additional mild assumptions.
"
What are the lattice spectral functions used in the calculation of quarkonium Euclidean correlators?,"  We update our recent calculation of quarkonium Euclidean correlators at
finite temperatures in a potential model by including the effect of zero modes
in the lattice spectral functions. These contributions cure most of the
previously observed discrepancies with lattice calculations, supporting the use
of potential models at finite temperature as an important tool to complement
lattice studies.
"
What is the effect of non-linear gravitational effects on the Hawking quanta in a black hole geometry?,"  In the semi-classical treatment, i.e. in a classical black hole geometry,
Hawking quanta emerge from trans-Planckian configurations because of scale
invariance. There is indeed no scale to stop the blue-shifting effect
encountered in the backward propagation towards the event horizon. On the
contrary, when taking into account the gravitational interactions neglected in
the semi-classical treatment, a UV scale stopping the blue-shift could be
dynamically engendered. To show that this is the case, we use a
non-perturbative treatment based on the large-N limit, where $N$ is the number
of matter fields. In this limit, the semi-classical treatment is the leading
contribution. Non-linear gravitational effects appear in the next orders and in
the first of these, the effects are governed by the two-point correlation
function of the energy-momentum tensor evaluated in the vacuum. Taking this
correlator into account, backward propagated modes are dissipated at a distance
from the horizon $\propto G\kappa$ when measured in a freely falling frame.
($G$ is Newton's constant and $\kappa$ the surface gravity.) This result can be
also obtained by considering light propagation in a stochastic ensemble of
metrics whose fluctuations are determined by the above correlator.
"
What are the key factors that contribute to the oxygen depletion in globular clusters?,"  In spite of the efforts made in the latest years, still there is no
comprehensive explanation for the chemical anomalies of globular cluster stars.
Among these, the most striking is oxygen depletion, which reaches values down
to [O/Fe]~-0.4 in most clusters, but in M13 it goes down to less than [O/Fe]~ -
1. In this work we suggest that the anomalies are due to the super position of
two different events: 1) PRIMORDIAL SELF-ENRICHMENT: this is asked to explain
the oxygen depletion down to a minimum value [O/Fe]~ -0.4; 2) EXTRA MIXING IN A
FRACTION OF THE STARS ALREADY BORN WITH ANOMALOUS COMPOSITION: these objects,
starting with already low [O/Fe], will reduce the oxygen abundance down to the
most extreme values. Contrary to other models that invoke extra mixing to
explain the chemical anomalies, we suggest that it is active only if there is a
fraction of the stars in which the primordial composition is not only oxygen
depleted, but also extremely helium rich (Y~ 0.4), as found in a few GCs from
their main sequence multiplicity. We propose that the rotational evolution (and
an associated extra mixing) of extremely helium rich stars may be affected by
the fact that they develop a very small or non existent molecular weight
barrier during the evolution. We show that extra mixing in these stars, having
initial chemistry that has already been CNO processed, affects mainly the
oxygen abundance, and to a much smaller extent if affects the sodium abundance.
The model also predicts a large fluorine depletion concomitant with the oxygen
depletion, and a further enhancement of the surface helium abundance, which
reaches values close to Y=0.5 in the computed models. We stress that, in this
tentative explanation, those stars that are primordially O--depleted, but ARE
NOT extremely helium rich do not suffer deep extra mixing.
"
What is the optically driven quantum gate in a solid state device?,"  An interesting approach to achieve quantum gate operations in a solid state
device is to implement an optically driven quantum gate using two vertically
coupled self-assembled quantum dots, a quantum dot molecule (QDM). We present a
realistic model for exciton dynamics in InGaAs/GaAs QDMs under intense laser
excitation and applied electric fields. The dynamics is obtained by solutions
of the Lindblad master equation. A map of the dressed ground state as function
of laser energy and applied electric field exhibits rich structure that
includes excitonic anticrossings that permit the identification of the relevant
couplings. The optical signatures of the dipole-dipole Forster energy transfer
mechanism show as splittings of several (spatially) indirect excitonic lines.
Moreover, we construct a model for exciton qubit rotations by adiabatic
electric field cyclic sweeps into a Forster-tunneling regime which induces
level anticrossings. The proposed qubit exhibits Rabi oscillations among two
well defined exciton pairs as function of the residence time at the
anticrossing.
"
What are the implications of the results on the discrepancies between solar models and helioseismic observations?,"  We use very precise frequencies of low-degree solar-oscillation modes
measured from 4752 days of data collected by the Birmingham Solar-Oscillations
Network (BiSON) to derive seismic information on the solar core. We compare
these observations to results from a large Monte Carlo simulation of standard
solar models, and use the results to constrain the mean molecular weight of the
solar core, and the metallicity of the solar convection zone. We find that only
a high value of solar metallicity is consistent with the seismic observations.
We can determine the mean molecular weight of the solar core to a very high
precision, and, dependent on the sequence of Monte Carlo models used, find that
the average mean molecular weight in the inner 20% by radius of the Sun ranges
from 0.7209 to 0.7231, with uncertainties of less than 0.5% on each value. Our
lowest seismic estimate of solar metallicity is Z=0.0187 and our highest is
Z=0.0239, with uncertainties in the range of 12--19%. Our results indicate that
the discrepancies between solar models constructed with low metallicity and the
helioseismic observations extend to the solar core and thus cannot be
attributed to deficiencies in the modeling of the solar convection zone.
"
What are the effects of the pulsation mechanism and dust formation for the creation of a stellar wind on the mass loss thresholds?,"  It is well established that mass loss from AGB stars due to dust driven winds
cannot be arbitrarily low. We model the mass loss from carbon rich AGB stars
using detailed frequency-dependent radiation hydrodynamics including dust
formation. We present a study of the thresholds for the mass loss rate as a
function of stellar parameters based on a subset of a larger grid of such
models and compare these results to previous observational and theoretical
work. Furthermore, we demonstrate the impact of the pulsation mechanism and
dust formation for the creation of a stellar wind and how it affects these
thresholds and briefly discuss the consequences for stellar evolution.
"
What is the IMF of a young star-forming association of 18 stars?,"  Eta Chamaeleontis is a unique young (~9 Myr) association with 18 systems
concentrated in a radius of ~35 arcmin, i.e. 1pc at the cluster distance of
97pc. No other members have been found up to 1.5 degrees from the cluster
centre. The cluster mass function is consistent with the IMF of other rich
young open clusters in the higher mass range but shows a clear deficit of low
mass stars and brown dwarfs with no objects below 0.1Msun. The aim of this
paper is to test whether this peculiar mass function could result from
dynamical evolution despite the young age of the cluster. We performed N-body
numerical calculations starting with a log-normal IMF and different initial
conditions in terms of number of systems and cluster radius using the code
NBODY3. We simulated the cluster dynamical evolution over 10 Myr and compared
the results to the observations. We found that it is possible to reproduce eta
Cha when starting with a very compact configuration (with Ninit=40 and
R0=0.005pc) which suggests that the IMF of the association might not be
abnormal. The high initial density might also explain the deficit of wide
binaries that is observed in the cluster.
"
What are the key properties of the Triebel-Lizorkin and Besov spaces?,"  Decomposition systems with rapidly decaying elements (needlets) based on
Hermite functions are introduced and explored. It is proved that the
Triebel-Lizorkin and Besov spaces on $\R^d$ induced by Hermite expansions can
be characterized in terms of the needlet coefficients. It is also shown that
the Hermite Triebel-Lizorkin and Besov spaces are, in general, different from
the respective classical spaces.
"
What is the condition for the existence of a solution to the equation ab + cd = λ?,"  We consider the equation $$ ab + cd = \lambda, \qquad a\in A, b \in B, c\in
C, d \in D, $$ over a finite field $F_q$ of $q$ elements, with variables from
arbitrary sets $ A, B, C, D \subseteq F_q$. The question of solvability of such
and more general equations has recently been considered by D. Hart and A.
Iosevich, who, in particular, proved that if $$ #A #B #C #D \gg q^3, $$ then
above equation has a solution for any $\lambda \in F_q^*$. Here we show that
using bounds of multiplicative character sums allows us to extend the class of
sets which satisfy this property.
"
What is the role of the charge on micron-sized dust grains in the formation of aggregates?,"  The charge on micron-sized dust grains plays a crucial role in the structure
and evolution of forming aggregates within the dust population during the
coagulation process. The manner in which the charge is arranged on developing
irregular structures can affect the fractal dimension of aggregates formed
during collisions, which in turn influences the coagulation rate and size
evolution of the dust cloud. Preliminary models for the charge evolution on
fractal aggregates immersed in a plasma environment calculated using a
modification to the orbital-motion-limited (OML) theory are presented in this
paper. The model calculates currents to each point on the aggregate surface
using a line-of-sight (LOS) approximation: only those electron or ion
trajectories which are not blocked by another grain within the aggregate
contribute to the charging current. Both the total charge and the dipole moment
are calculated for the dust aggregate. While most coagulation theories assume
that it is difficult for like-charged grains to coagulate, the OML_LOS
approximation indicates that the electric potentials of aggregate structures
are often reduced enough to allow significant coagulation.
"
What is the relationship between the quantum system and the classical system?,"  We consider a particle moving on a cone and bound to its tip by $1/r$ or
harmonic oscillator potentials. When the deficit angle of the cone divided by
$2 \pi$ is a rational number, all bound classical orbits are closed.
Correspondingly, the quantum system has accidental degeneracies in the discrete
energy spectrum. An accidental SU(2) symmetry is generated by the rotations
around the tip of the cone as well as by a Runge-Lenz vector. Remarkably, some
of the corresponding multiplets have fractional ``spin'' and unusual
degeneracies.
"
What is the role of non-inertial frames in general relativity?,"  The role of non-inertial frames in a class of models of general relativity is
clarified by means of Dirac's theory of constraints. The identification of a
York canonical basis allows to give the interpretation of the gauge variables
as generalized inertial effects and to identify the Dirac observables of the
gravitational field with generalized tidal effects. York time is the gauge
variable controlling the clock synchronization convention. Differently from
special relativity, the instantaneous 3-spaces are dynamically determined.
"
What are the results of the exact numeric calculations of the Matsubara Green function in imaginary times?,"  We present recent advances in understanding of the ground and excited states
of the electron-phonon coupled systems obtained by novel methods of
Diagrammatic Monte Carlo and Stochastic Optimization, which enable the
approximation-free calculation of Matsubara Green function in imaginary times
and perform unbiased analytic continuation to real frequencies. We present
exact numeric results on the ground state properties, Lehmann spectral function
and optical conductivity of different strongly correlated systems: Frohlich
polaron, Rashba-Pekar exciton-polaron, pseudo Jahn-Teller polaron, exciton, and
interacting with phonons hole in the t-J model.
"
"What are the key adjustments made to the M_bh-Luminosity relations in McLure & Dunlop, Marconi & Hunt, and Erwin et al. to achieve consistency?","  The differing M_bh-Luminosity relations presented in McLure & Dunlop, Marconi
& Hunt and Erwin et al. have been investigated. A number of issues have been
identified and addressed in each of these studies, including but not limited
to: the removal of a dependency on the Hubble constant; a correction for dust
attenuation in the bulges of disc galaxies; the identification of lenticular
galaxies previously treated as elliptical galaxies; and application of the same
(Y|X) regression analysis. These adjustments result in relations which now
predict similar black hole masses. The optimal K-band relation is
log(M_bh/M_sun) = -0.37(+/-0.04)[M_K +24] + 8.29(+/-0.08), with a total (not
intrinsic) scatter in log M_bh equal to 0.33 dex. This level of scatter is
similar to the value of 0.34 dex from the M_bh-sigma relation of Tremaine et
al. and compares favourably with the value of 0.31 dex from the M_bh-n relation
of Graham & Driver. Using different photometric data, consistent relations in
the B- and R-band are also provided, although we do note that the small (N=13)
R-band sample used by Erwin et al. is found here to have a slope of
-0.30(+/-0.06) and a total scatter of 0.31 dex. Performing a symmetrical
regression on the larger K-band sample gives a slope of -0.40, implying M_bh ~
L^{1.00}. Implications for galaxy-black hole coevolution, in terms of dry
mergers, are briefly discussed, as are predictions for intermediate mass black
holes. Finally, as previously noted by Tundo et al., a potential bias in the
galaxy sample used to define the M_bh-L relations is shown and a corrective
formula provided.
"
What are the results of the renormalization procedure for the diffusion of the walk on Z generated by the location of points of the sequence {nα + β} on a binary partition of the unit interval?,"  We introduce a renormalization procedure which allows us to study in a
unified and concise way different properties of the irrational rotations on the
unit circle $\beta \mapsto \set{\alpha+\beta}$, $\alpha \in \R\setminus \Q$. In
particular we obtain sharp results for the diffusion of the walk on $\Z$
generated by the location of points of the sequence $\{n\alpha +\beta\}$ on a
binary partition of the unit interval. Finally we give some applications of our
method.
"
What is the asymptotic expansion of the Bergman kernel on the non-smooth worm domains?,"  This paper provides a precise asymptotic expansion for the Bergman kernel on
the non-smooth worm domains of Christer Kiselman in complex 2-space.
Applications are given to the failure of Condition R, to deviant boundary
behavior of the kernel, and to L^p mapping properties of the kernel.
"
What is the mean density of the star beta Hydri?,"  We have used the Sydney University Stellar Interferometer (SUSI) to measure
the angular diameter of beta Hydri. This star is a nearby G2 subgiant whose
mean density was recently measured with high precision using asteroseismology.
We determine the radius and effective temperature of the star to be
1.814+/-0.017 R_sun (0.9%) and 5872+/-44 K (0.7%) respectively. By combining
this value with the mean density, as estimated from asteroseismology, we make a
direct estimate of the stellar mass. We find a value of 1.07+/-0.03 M_sun
(2.8%), which agrees with published estimates based on fitting in the H-R
diagram, but has much higher precision. These results place valuable
constraints on theoretical models of beta Hyi and its oscillation frequencies.
"
What are the astrophysical evidence and particle candidates for dark matter?,"  This is a short review, aimed at a general audience, of several current
subjects of research in cosmology. The topics discussed include the cosmic
microwave background (CMB), with particular emphasis on its relevance for
testing inflation; dark matter, with a brief review of astrophysical evidence
and more emphasis on particle candidates; and cosmic acceleration and some of
the ideas that have been put forward to explain it. A glossary of technical
terms and acronyms is provided.
"
What is the expression for the O(alpha_s^3) contribution chi_2 to the kernel of the BFKL equation?,"  We determine an approximate expression for the O(alpha_s^3) contribution
chi_2 to the kernel of the BFKL equation, which includes all collinear and
anticollinear singular contributions. This is derived using recent results on
the relation between the GLAP and BFKL kernels (including running-coupling
effects to all orders) and on small-x factorization schemes. We present the
result in various schemes, relevant both for applications to the BFKL equation
and to small-x evolution of parton distributions.
"
What is the asymptotic behavior of the probability formula for a growing number of variables?,"  With the advent of high-throughput profiling methods, interest in reverse
engineering the structure and dynamics of biochemical networks is high.
Recently an algorithm for reverse engineering of biochemical networks was
developed by Laubenbacher and Stigler. It is a top-down approach using time
discrete dynamical systems. One of its key steps includes the choice of a term
order. The aim of this paper is to identify minimal requirements on data sets
to be used with this algorithm and to characterize optimal data sets. We found
minimal requirements on a data set based on how many terms the functions to be
reverse engineered display. Furthermore, we identified optimal data sets, which
we characterized using a geometric property called ""general position"".
Moreover, we developed a constructive method to generate optimal data sets,
provided a codimensional condition is fulfilled. In addition, we present a
generalization of their algorithm that does not depend on the choice of a term
order. For this method we derived a formula for the probability of finding the
correct model, provided the data set used is optimal. We analyzed the
asymptotic behavior of the probability formula for a growing number of
variables n (i.e. interacting chemicals). Unfortunately, this formula converges
to zero as fast as r^(q^n), where q is a natural number and 0<r<1. Therefore,
even if an optimal data set is used and the restrictions in using term orders
are overcome, the reverse engineering problem remains unfeasible, unless
prodigious amounts of data are available. Such large data sets are
experimentally impossible to generate with today's technologies.
"
What are the configurations of extremal even unimodular lattices generated by their minimal-norm vectors?,"  We extend the results of Ozeki on the configurations of extremal even
unimodular lattices. Specifically, we show that if L is such a lattice of rank
56, 72, or 96, then L is generated by its minimal-norm vectors.
"
What are the interactions involving neutrino-photon interactions at finite baryon density?,"  We propose new physical processes based on the axial vector anomaly and
described by the Wess-Zumino-Witten term that couples the photon, Z-boson, and
the omega-meson. The interaction takes the form of a pseudo-Chern-Simons term,
$\sim \epsilon_{\mu\nu\rho\sigma}\omega^\mu Z^\nu F^{\rho\sigma}$. This term
induces neutrino-photon interactions at finite baryon density via the coupling
of the Z-boson to neutrinos. These interactions may be detectable in various
laboratory and astrophysical arenas. The new interactions may account for the
MiniBooNE excess. They also produce a competitive contribution to neutron star
cooling at temperatures >10^9 K. These processes and related axion--photon
interactions at finite baryon density appear to be relevant in many
astrophysical regimes.
"
What are the applications of sensory substitution or perceptual supplementation technologies for people with disabilities?,"  The present paper aims at introducing the innovative technologies, based on
the concept of ""sensory substitution"" or ""perceptual supplementation"", we are
developing in the fields of human disability and biomedical engineering.
Precisely, our goal is to design, develop and validate practical assistive
biomedical and/technical devices and/or rehabilitating procedures for persons
with disabilities, using artificial tongue-placed tactile biofeedback systems.
Proposed applications are dealing with: (1) pressure sores prevention in case
of spinal cord injuries (persons with paraplegia, or tetraplegia); (2) ankle
proprioceptive acuity improvement for driving assistance in older and/or
disabled adults; and (3) balance control improvement to prevent fall in older
and/or disabled adults. This paper presents results of three feasibility
studies performed on young healthy adults.

What are the algebraic structure of degree 2 operators considered in terms of an algebra?,"  Bi-Hamiltonian structures involving Hamiltonian operators of degree 2 are
studied. Firstly, pairs of degree 2 operators are considered in terms of an
algebra structure on the space of 1-forms, related to so-called Fermionic
Novikov algebras. Then, degree 2 operators are considered as deformations of
hydrodynamic type Poisson brackets.
"
What is the temperature dependence of the stripe width in a ferromagnet with finite size?,"  We describe a novel type of magnetic domain wall which, in contrast to Bloch
or Neel walls, is non-localized and, in a certain temperature range,
non-monotonic. The wall appears as the mean-field solution of the
two-dimensional ferromagnetic Ising model frustrated by the long-ranged dipolar
interaction. We provide experimental evidence of this wall delocalization in
the stripe-domain phase of perpendicularly magnetized ultrathin magnetic films.
In agreement with experimental results, we find that the stripe width decreases
with increasing temperature and approaches a finite value at the
Curie-temperature following a power law. The same kind of wall and a similar
temperature dependence of the stripe width is expected in the mean-field
approximation of the two-dimensional Coulomb frustrated Ising ferromagnet.
"
What is the relationship between wave-particle duality and wave-particle duality?,"  Wave-particle duality finds a natural application for electrons or light
propagating in disordered media where coherent corrections to transport are
given by two-wave interference. For scatterers with internal degrees of
freedom, these corrections are observed to be much smaller than would be
expected for structureless scatterers. By examining the basic example of the
scattering of one photon by two spin-1/2 atoms--a case-study for coherent
backscattering--we demonstrate that the loss of interference strength is
associated with which-path information stored by the scattering atoms.
"
What are the relations between Hamiltonian operators and Fermionic Novikov algebras?,"  Bi-Hamiltonian structures involving Hamiltonian operators of degree 2 are
studied. Firstly, pairs of degree 2 operators are considered in terms of an
algebra structure on the space of 1-forms, related to so-called Fermionic
Novikov algebras. Then, degree 2 operators are considered as deformations of
hydrodynamic type Poisson brackets.
"
What are the results of the independent component analysis (ICA) of the rate-code model?,"  A population of firing neurons is expected to carry not only mean firing rate
but also its fluctuation and synchrony among neurons. In order to examine this
possibility, we have studied responses of neuronal ensembles to three kinds of
inputs: mean-, fluctuation- and synchrony-driven inputs. The generalized
rate-code model including additive and multiplicative noise (H. Hasegawa, Phys.
Rev. E {\bf 75}, 051904 (2007)) has been studied by direct simulations (DSs)
and the augmented moment method (AMM) in which equations of motion for mean
firing rate, fluctuation and synchrony are derived. Results calculated by the
AMM are in good agreement with those by DSs. The independent component analysis
(ICA) of our results has shown that mean firing rate, fluctuation (or
variability) and synchrony may carry independent information in the population
rate-code model. The input-output relation of mean firing rates is shown to
have higher sensitivity for larger multiplicative noise, as recently observed
in prefrontal cortex. A comparison is made between results obtained by the
integrate-and-fire (IF) model and our rate-code model. The relevance of our
results to experimentally obtained data is also discussed.
"
What are the implications of the entanglement of spin and its environment in impurity systems for the behavior of Nano-systems?,"  We investigate the entanglement between a spin and its environment in
impurity systems which exhibit a second-order quantum phase transition. As an
application, we employ the spin-boson model, describing a two-level system
(spin) coupled to a subohmic bosonic bath with power-law spectral density,
${\cal J}(\omega)\propto \omega^s$ and $0<s<1$. Combining Wilson's Numerical
Renormalization Group method and hyperscaling relations, we demonstrate that
the entanglement between the spin and its environment is always enhanced at the
quantum phase transition resulting in a visible cusp (maximum) in the entropy
of entanglement. We formulate a correspondence between criticality and impurity
entanglement entropy, and the relevance of these ideas to Nano-systems is
outlined.
"
What is the quantum probability density generated by the internal vibration in a linear Schrödinger equation?,"  We develop a class of soliton solution of {\it linear} Schr\""odinger equation
without external potential. The quantum probability density generates its own
boundary inside which there is internal vibration whose wave number is
determined by the velocity of the particle as firstly conjectured by de
Broglie. Assuming resonance of the internal vibration will lead to quantization
of particle's momentum in term of wave number of the envelope quantum
probability density. We further show that the linearity of the Schr\""odinger
equation allows us to have non-interacting many solitons solution through
superposition, each describing a particle with equal mass.
"
What are the generic forms of the metrics of supersymmetric solutions?,"  We find a complete characterization of all the supersymmetric solutions of
non-Abelian gauged N=1,d=5 supergravity coupled to vector multiplets and
hypermultiplets: the generic forms of the metrics as functions of the scalars
and vector fields plus the equations that all these must satisfy. These
equations are now a complicated non-linear system and there it seems impossible
to produce an algorithm to construct systematically all supersymmetric
solutions.
"
"What is Interacting Growth Walks, and what is its application to the coil-globule transition of linear polymers?","  Interacting Growth Walks is a recently proposed stochastic model for studying
the coil-globule transition of linear polymers. We propose a flat energy
histogram version for Interacting Growth Walk. We demonstrate the algorithm on
two dimensional square and triangular lattices by calculating the density of
energy states of Interacting Self Avoiding Walks.
"
What is the stochastic differential equation that the process satisfies?,"  We propose a proof of convergence of an adaptive method used in molecular
dynamics to compute free energy profiles. Mathematically, it amounts to
studying the long-time behavior of a stochastic process which satisfies a
non-linear stochastic differential equation, where the drift depends on
conditional expectations of some functionals of the process. We use entropy
techniques to prove exponential convergence to the stationary state.
"
What are the distinguishing host galaxy properties of each class?,"  Using the large emission line galaxy sample from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey
we show that Star forming galaxies, Seyferts, and low-ionization nuclear
emission-line regions (LINERs) form clearly separated branches on the standard
optical diagnostic diagrams. We derive a new empirical classification scheme
which cleanly separates these emission-line galaxies, using strong optical
emission lines. Using this classification we identify a few distinguishing host
galaxy properties of each class, which, along with the emission line analysis,
suggest continuous evolution from one class to another. As a final note, we
introduce models of both Starforming galaxies and AGN narrow line regions which
can explain the distribution of galaxies on standard emission line ratio
diagrams, and possibly suggest new diagnostics across the emission spectrum.
"
What is the stochastic process for molecular transport in asymmetric nucleation of domains on a one-dimensional substrate?,"  We propose a stochastic process wherein molecular transport is mediated by
asymmetric nucleation of domains on a one-dimensional substrate. Track-driven
mechanisms of molecular transport arise in biophysical applications such as
Holliday junction positioning and collagenase processivity. In contrast to
molecular motors that hydrolyze nucleotide triphosphates and undergo a local
molecular conformational change, we show that asymmetric nucleation of
hydrolysis waves on a track can also result in directed motion of an attached
particle. Asymmetrically cooperative kinetics between ``hydrolyzed'' and
``unhydrolyzed'' states on each lattice site generate moving domain walls that
push a particle sitting on the track. We use a novel fluctuating-frame,
finite-segment mean field theory to accurately compute steady-state velocities
of the driven particle and to discover parameter regimes which yield maximal
domain wall flux, leading to optimal particle drift.
"
What is the relationship between the mass of the 4th generation quark t' and the b-->s lepton rate?,"  This study investigates the influence of the fourth generation quarks on the
double lepton polarizations in \Lambda_b --> \Lambda \ell^+ \ell^- decay by
taking |V^\ast_{t's}V_{t'b}|= 0.005,0.01,0.02,0.03 with phase
\{60^\circ,90^\circ,120^\circ\}. We will try to obtain a constrain on the mass
of the 4th generation top like quark t', which is consistent with the $b-->
s\ell^+\ell^- rate . With the above mentioned parameters, we will try to show
that the double lepton(muon, tau) polarizations are quite sensitive to the
existence of fourth generation. It can serve as a good tool to search for new
physics effects, precisely, to search for the fourth generation quarks(t', b')
via its indirect manifestations in loop diagrams.
"
What are the implications of the divergent increase of the muon spin relaxation rate for the Cu-3d spin fluctuations?,"  Zero-field muon-spin-relaxation (ZF-{\boldmath $\mu$}SR) measurements were
carried out down to 80 mK on the randomness bond system Tl$_{1-x}$K$_x$CuCl$_3$
with $x$ = 0.44. Time spectra are well fitted by the stretched exponential
function $\exp (-\lambda t)^{\beta}$. The muon spin relaxation rate $\lambda$
increases rapidly with decreasing temperature, and $\beta$ tends to 0.5 at 80
mK. The divergent increase of $\lambda$ suggests the critical slowing down of
the frequency of the Cu-3{\it d} spin fluctuations toward a spin frozen state
below 80 mK, and the root-exponential-like behavior of the time spectrum
indicates that the origin of the relaxation is possibly the spatially-fixed
fluctuating dilute moments.
"
What is the effective theory for the bosonic modes used to investigate the melting of the CFL phase?,"  We study the behavior of Goldstone bosons in color-flavor-locked (CFL) quark
matter at nonzero temperature. Chiral symmetry breaking in this phase of cold
and dense matter gives rise to pseudo-Goldstone bosons, the lightest of these
being the charged and neutral kaons K^+ and K^0. At zero temperature,
Bose-Einstein condensation of the kaons occurs. Since all fermions are gapped,
this kaon condensed CFL phase can, for energies below the fermionic energy gap,
be described by an effective theory for the bosonic modes. We use this
effective theory to investigate the melting of the condensate: we determine the
temperature-dependent kaon masses self-consistently using the two-particle
irreducible effective action, and we compute the transition temperature for
Bose-Einstein condensation. Our results are important for studies of transport
properties of the kaon condensed CFL phase, such as bulk viscosity.
"
What are the conditions for constructing a fractal-like Costas bijection in the real continuum?,"  We extend the definition of the Costas property to functions in the
continuum, namely on intervals of the reals or the rationals, and argue that
such functions can be used in the same applications as discrete Costas arrays.
We construct Costas bijections in the real continuum within the class of
piecewise continuously differentiable functions, but our attempts to construct
a fractal-like Costas bijection there are successful only under slight but
necessary deviations from the usual arithmetic laws. Furthermore, we are able,
contingent on the validity of Artin's conjecture, to set up a limiting process
according to which sequences of Welch Costas arrays converge to smooth Costas
bijections over the reals. The situation over the rationals is different:
there, we propose an algorithm of great generality and flexibility for the
construction of a Costas fractal bijection. Its success, though, relies heavily
on the enumerability of the rationals, and therefore it cannot be generalized
over the reals in an obvious way.
"
What is the effect of H-passivation on the surface properties of the Si surface?,"  The structures and energetics of organic molecules adsorbed onto clean and
H-passivated Si(001)-(2$\times$1) surfaces have been calculated using density
functional theory. For benzene adsorbed on the clean Si surface the
tight-bridge structure was found to be stable and the butterfly structure
metastable. Both carbonic acid H$_2$CO$_3$ and propane C$_3$H$_8$ dissociate on
contact with the surface. Passivation of the Si surface with H-atoms has a
dramatic effect on the surface properties. The passivated surface is very inert
and the binding energy of all the molecules is very weak.
"
What is the estimated energy of the transient radiation of the transient in the galaxy Messier 85?,"  Historically, variable and transient sources have both surprised astronomers
and provided new views of the heavens. Here we report the discovery of an
optical transient in the outskirts of the lenticular galaxy Messier 85 in the
Virgo Cluster. With a peak absolute R magnitude of -12 this event is distinctly
brighter than novae, but fainter than type Ia supernovae (expected from a
population of old stars in lenticular galaxies). Archival images of the field
do not show a luminous star at that position with an upper limit of ~-4.1, so
it is unlikely to be a giant eruption from a luminous blue variable star. Over
a two month period the transient emitted radiation energy of almost 10E47 erg
and subsequently faded in the opical sky. It is similar to, but more luminous
at peak by a factor of 6 than, an enigmatic transient in the galaxy M31. A
possible origin of M85 OT2006-1 is a stellar merger. If so, searches for
similar events in nearby galaxies will not only allow to study the physics of
hyper-Eddington sources, but also probe an important phase in the evolution of
stellar binary systems.
"
How are the Luttinger liquid behavior in quantum wires determined from two independent measurements?,"  Luttinger liquid behavior of one-dimensional correlated electron systems is
characterized by power-law scaling of a variety of physical observables with
exponents determined by a single interaction dependent parameter K. We suggest
a setup to study Luttinger liquid behavior in quantum wires which allows to
determine K from two independent measurements: resonant transport through a
quantum dot embedded in the wire and the charge on the dot. Consistency of the
two measured values of K for a single probe would provide strong experimental
evidence for the Luttinger liquid paradigm.
"
What are the dynamics of ferromagnetic nanoparticles arranged in chains and bracelet-like rings?,"  Iron, cobalt and nickel nanoparticles, grown in the gas phase, are known to
arrange in chains and bracelet-like rings due to the long-range dipolar
interaction between the ferromagnetic (or super-paramagnetic) particles. We
investigate the dynamics and thermodynamics of such magnetic dipolar
nanoparticles for low densities using molecular dynamics simulations and
analyze the influence of temperature and external magnetic fields on two- and
three-dimensional systems. The obtained phase diagrams can be understood by
using simple energetic arguments.
"
What is the role of uniform electric field sampling in the Monte Carlo method?,"  We study some aspects of a Monte Carlo method invented by Maggs and Rossetto
for simulating systems of charged particles. It has the feature that the
discretized electric field is updated locally when charges move. Results of
simulations of the two dimensional one-component plasma are presented. Highly
accurate results can be obtained very efficiently using this lattice method
over a large temperature range. The method differs from global methods in
having additional degrees of freedom which leads to the question of how a
faster method can result. We argue that efficient sampling depends on charge
mobility and find that the mobility is close to maximum for a low rate of
independent plaquette updates for intermediate temperatures. We present a
simple model to account for this behavior. We also report on the role of
uniform electric field sampling using this method.
"
What is the tetra-quark interpretation of X(3872)?,"  A new tetra-quark interpretation of X(3872) is presented. In this model,
X(3872) consists of two degenerate tetra-quark mesons, {[cn](cbar nbar) +-
(cn)[cbar nbar]}_{I=0}, and, therefore, it is naturally understood that X(3872)
decays into two different eigenstates of G-parity.
"
Can the STIRAP-based unitary decelerating and accelerating processes be used to manipulate and control the center-of-mass position and momentum of a Gaussian wave-packet motional state of a free atom?,"  A STIRAP-based unitary decelerating (accelerating) process consists of a
train of the standard three-state STIRAP pulse sequences which may act as the
basic unitary decelerating (accelerating) sequences. The present work is
focused on investigating analytically and quantitatively how the momentum
distribution of a momentum superposition state such as a momentum Gaussian
wave-packet state of a single freely moving atom affects the STIRAP state
transfer in these decelerating and accelerating processes. The complete STIRAP
state transfer and the unitarity of these processes are stressed highly in the
investigation. It has been shown that the momentum distribution has an
important influence upon the STIRAP state-transfer efficiency. In the ideal
adiabatic condition these unitary decelerating and accelerating processes for a
freely moving atom are studied in detail, and it is shown that they can be used
to manipulate and control in time and space the center-of-mass position and
momentum of a Gaussian wave-packet motional state of a free atom. Two general
(strict and accurate) adiabatic conditions for the basic STIRAP decelerating
and accelerating processes are derived analytically. With the help of the
STIRAP theory and the unitary quantum dynamics it confirms theoretically that
the time- and space-compressing processes of the quantum control process
(quant-ph/0607144) can be realized almost perfectly by the STIRAP-based unitary
decelerating and accelerating processes in the ideal or nearly ideal adiabatic
condition.
"
What are the parameters estimated in the Markov Chain Monte Carlo search?,"  Gravitational waves from the inspiral and coalescence of supermassive
black-hole (SMBH) binaries with masses ~10^6 Msun are likely to be among the
strongest sources for the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). We
describe a three-stage data-analysis pipeline designed to search for and
measure the parameters of SMBH binaries in LISA data. The first stage uses a
time-frequency track-search method to search for inspiral signals and provide a
coarse estimate of the black-hole masses m_1, m_2 and of the coalescence time
of the binary t_c. The second stage uses a sequence of matched-filter template
banks, seeded by the first stage, to improve the measurement accuracy of the
masses and coalescence time. Finally, a Markov Chain Monte Carlo search is used
to estimate all nine physical parameters of the binary. Using results from the
second stage substantially shortens the Markov Chain burn-in time and allows us
to determine the number of SMBH-binary signals in the data before starting
parameter estimation. We demonstrate our analysis pipeline using simulated data
from the first LISA Mock Data Challenge. We discuss our plan for improving this
pipeline and the challenges that will be faced in real LISA data analysis.
"
What is the mapping between the stochastic model and the zero-range process?,"  We introduce a stochastic model of growing networks where both, the number of
new nodes which joins the network and the number of connections, vary
stochastically. We provide an exact mapping between this model and zero range
process, and use this mapping to derive an analytical solution of degree
distribution for any given evolution rule. One can also use this mapping to
infer about a possible evolution rule for a given network. We demonstrate this
for protein-protein interaction (PPI) network for Saccharomyces Cerevisiae.
"
What is the Coleman Weinberg effective potential for the Higgs field in RS Gauge-Higgs unification scenarios?,"  We compute the Coleman Weinberg effective potential for the Higgs field in RS
Gauge-Higgs unification scenarios based on a bulk SO(5) x U(1)_X gauge
symmetry, with gauge and fermion fields propagating in the bulk and a custodial
symmetry protecting the generation of large corrections to the T parameter and
the coupling of the Z to the bottom quark. We demonstrate that electroweak
symmetry breaking may be realized, with proper generation of the top and bottom
quark masses for the same region of bulk mass parameters that lead to good
agreement with precision electroweak data in the presence of a light Higgs. We
compute the Higgs mass and demonstrate that for the range of parameters for
which the Higgs boson has Standard Model-like properties, the Higgs mass is
naturally in a range that varies between values close to the LEP experimental
limit and about 160 GeV. This mass range may be probed at the Tevatron and at
the LHC. We analyze the KK spectrum and briefly discuss the phenomenology of
the light resonances arising in our model.
"
What are the implications of the results for our understanding of neutrino oscillations?,"  Updating our previous measurements with new data and analysis modifications,
we report preliminary results on the energy-dependent deficit of muon neutrinos
from the Fermilab NuMI beam as observed with the MINOS Far Detector located 735
km away in the Soudan Underground Laboratory. From an exposure of 2.50x10^20
protons on target, we observe 563 charged-current nu_mu interaction candidates
in the Far Detector, where 738+/-30 events are expected in the absence of
neutrino oscillations. We have analyzed these data assuming two-flavor nu_mu to
nu_tau oscillations. From a simultaneous fit to the reconstructed nu_mu energy
spectra obtained during two running periods we obtain the neutrino squared-mass
difference Delta m_{32}^2 = (2.38 +0.20/-0.16) x 10^-3 eV^2/c^4 with errors at
68% confidence level (CL), and mixing angle sin^2(2 theta_23) > 0.84 at 90% CL.
The uncertainties and confidence intervals include both statistical and
systematic errors. All results and plots presented here are preliminary.
"
What are the implications of the Monge-Amp\`ere formula for the volume of a convex body?,"  We use geometric methods to calculate a formula for the complex
Monge-Amp\`ere measure $(dd^cV_K)^n$, for $K \Subset \RR^n \subset \CC^n$ a
convex body and $V_K$ its Siciak-Zaharjuta extremal function. Bedford and
Taylor had computed this for symmetric convex bodies $K$. We apply this to show
that two methods for deriving Bernstein-Markov-type inequalities, i.e.,
pointwise estimates of gradients of polynomials, yield the same results for all
convex bodies. A key role is played by the geometric result that the extremal
inscribed ellipses appearing in approximation theory are the maximal area
ellipses determining the complex Monge-Amp\`ere solution $V_K$.
"
What are the implications of the Chern number in the topological insulator phase?,"  The topological insulator is an electronic phase stabilized by spin-orbit
coupling that supports propagating edge states and is not adiabatically
connected to the ordinary insulator. In several ways it is a spin-orbit-induced
analogue in time-reversal-invariant systems of the integer quantum Hall effect
(IQHE). This paper studies the topological insulator phase in disordered
two-dimensional systems, using a model graphene Hamiltonian introduced by Kane
and Mele as an example. The nonperturbative definition of a topological
insulator given here is distinct from previous efforts in that it involves
boundary phase twists that couple only to charge, does not refer to edge
states, and can be measured by pumping cycles of ordinary charge. In this
definition, the phase of a Slater determinant of electronic states is
determined by a Chern parity analogous to Chern number in the IQHE case.
Numerically we find, in agreement with recent network model studies, that the
direct transition between ordinary and topological insulators that occurs in
band structures is a consequence of the perfect crystalline lattice.
Generically these two phases are separated by a metallic phase, which is
allowed in two dimensions when spin-orbit coupling is present. The same
approach can be used to study three-dimensional topological insulators.
"
What is the main conclusions drawn from the analysis of the Praesepe cluster?,"  The present paper provides a general overview of the asteroseismic potential
of delta Scuti stars in clusters, in particular focusing on convection
diagnostics. We give a summarise of the last results obtained by the authors
for the Praesepe cluster of which five delta Scuti stars are analysed. In that
work, linear analysis is confronted with observations, using refined
descriptions for the effects of rotation on the determination of the global
stellar parameters and on the adiabatic oscillation frequency computations. A
single, complete, and coherent solution for all the selected stars is found,
which lead the authors to find important restrictions to the convection
description for a certain range of effective temperatures. Furthermore, the
method used allowed to give an estimate of the global parameters of the
selected stars and constrain the cluster.
"
What are the spin-up electrons localized in acenes with more than seven fused benzene rings?,"  We examine the electronic ground state of acenes with different number of
fused benzene rings (up to 40) by using first principles density functional
theory. Their properties are compared with those of infinite polyacene. We find
that the ground state of acenes that consist of more than seven fused benzene
rings is an antiferromagnetic (in other words, open-shell singlet) state, and
we show that this singlet is not necessarily a diradical, because the spatially
separated magnetizations for the spin-up and spin-down electrons increase with
the size of the acene. For example, our results indicate that there are about
four spin-up electrons localized at one zigzag edge of 20-acene. The reason
that both acenes and polyacene have the antiferromagnetic ground state is due
to the zigzag-shaped boundaries, which cause pi-electrons to localize and form
spin orders at the edges. Both wider graphene ribbons and large
rectangular-shaped polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons have been shown to share
this antiferromagnetic ground state. Therefore, we demonstrate that the
pi-electronic structure of higher acenes and ployacene are still dictated by
the zigzag edges, and our results provide a consistent description of their
electronic ground state.
"
What is the concept of braided Hom-Lie bialgebras?,"  We introduce the new concept of braided Hom-Lie bialgebras which is a
generalization of Sommerh\""{a}user-Majid's braided Lie bialgebras and Yau's
Hom-Lie bialgebras. Using this concept we give the unified product construction
for Hom-Lie bialgebras which can be seen as a Hom-Lie version of
Bespalov-Drabant's cocycle cross product bialgebras. Some special cases of
unified products such as crossed product and matched pair of braided Hom-Lie
bialgebras are investigated. As an application, we solve the Agore-Militaru
extending problem for Hom-Lie bialgebras by using some non-abelian cohomology
theory. Furthermore, one dimensional flag extending structures for Hom-Lie
bialgebras are also investigated.
"
What is the wormhole geometry in the presence of a C-field?,"  Recently, Rahaman et al [ Nuovo.Cim 119B, 1115(2004)] have shown that the
static spherically symmetric solutions in presence of C-field give rise to
wormhole geometry. We highlight some of the characteristics of this wormhole,
which have not been considered in the previous study.
"
What are the constraints on the prompt optical flux densities and optical brightness of gamma-ray bursts?,"  We present several cases of optical observations during gamma-ray bursts
(GRBs) which resulted in prompt limits but no detection of optical emission.
These limits constrain the prompt optical flux densities and the optical
brightness relative to the gamma-ray emission. The derived constraints fall
within the range of properties observed in GRBs with prompt optical detections,
though at the faint end of optical/gamma flux ratios. The presently accessible
prompt optical limits do not require a different set of intrinsic or
environmental GRB properties, relative to the events with prompt optical
detections.
"
What are the stationary distributions of spacings for the Brownian motions with a constant upward drift?,"  We study interacting systems of linear Brownian motions whose drift vector at
every time point is determined by the relative ranks of the coordinate
processes at that time. Our main objective has been to study the long range
behavior of the spacings between the Brownian motions arranged in increasing
order. For finitely many Brownian motions interacting in this manner, we
characterize drifts for which the family of laws of the vector of spacings is
tight, and show its convergence to a unique stationary joint distribution given
by independent exponential distributions with varying means. We also study one
particular countably infinite system, where only the minimum Brownian particle
gets a constant upward drift, and prove that independent and identically
distributed exponential spacings remain stationary under the dynamics of such a
process. Some related conjectures in this direction have also been discussed.
"
What are the characteristics of the new continuous time quantum search algorithms?,"  We present two new continuous time quantum search algorithms similar to the
adiabatic search algorithm, but now without an adiabatic evolution. We find
that both algorithms work for a wide range of values of the parameters of the
Hamiltonian, and one of them has, as an additional feature that, for values of
time larger than a characteristic one, it will converge to a state which can be
close to the searched state.
"
What are the restrictions on the poles of meromorphic functions?,"  The Riemann-Roch theorem is of utmost importance in the algebraic geometric
theory of compact Riemann surfaces. It tells us how many linearly independent
meromorphic functions there are having certain restrictions on their poles. The
aim of this article is to present a simple direct proof of this theorem and
explore some of its numerous consequences. We also give an analytic proof of
the Riemann-Hurwitz formula. As an application, we compute the genus of some
interesting algebraic curves.
"
What are the processes that may have led to the formation of the Monoceros Ring?,"  Caustic rings of dark matter were predicted to exist in the plane of the
Galaxy at radii $a_n \simeq 40 {\rm kpc}/n$ for $n = 1,2,3 ..$. The recently
discovered Monoceros Ring of stars is located near the $n=2$ caustic, prompting
us to consider a possible connection between these two objects. We identify two
processes through which the Monoceros Ring of stars may have formed. One
process is the migration of gas to an angular velocity minimum at the caustic
leading to enhanced star formation there. The other is the adiabatic
deformation of star orbits as the caustic slowly grows in mass and radius. The
second process predicts an order 100% enhancement of the density of disk stars
at the location of the caustic ring.
"
What are the novel features of the solutions in the Lieb-Liniger model for interacting bosons in one dimension?,"  The exactly solvable Lieb-Liniger model of interacting bosons in
one-dimension has attracted renewed interest as current experiments with
ultra-cold atoms begin to probe this regime. Here we numerically solve the
equations arising from the Bethe ansatz solution for the exact many-body wave
function in a finite-size system of up to twenty particles for attractive
interactions. We discuss the novel features of the solutions, and how they
deviate from the well-known string solutions [H. B. Thacker, Rev. Mod. Phys.\
\textbf{53}, 253 (1981)] at finite densities. We present excited state string
solutions in the limit of strong interactions and discuss their physical
interpretation, as well as the characteristics of the quantum phase transition
that occurs as a function of interaction strength in the mean-field limit.
Finally we compare our results to those of exact diagonalization of the
many-body Hamiltonian in a truncated basis. We also present excited state
solutions and the excitation spectrum for the repulsive 1D Bose gas on a ring.
"
What is the application of the $p$-adic hierarchic classification algorithm to strings over finite alphabets?,"  An effective $p$-adic encoding of dendrograms is presented through an
explicit embedding into the Bruhat-Tits tree for a $p$-adic number field. This
field depends on the number of children of a vertex and is a finite extension
of the field of $p$-adic numbers. It is shown that fixing $p$-adic
representatives of the residue field allows a natural way of encoding strings
by identifying a given alphabet with such representatives. A simple $p$-adic
hierarchic classification algorithm is derived for $p$-adic numbers, and is
applied to strings over finite alphabets. Examples of DNA coding are presented
and discussed. Finally, new geometric and combinatorial invariants of time
series of $p$-adic dendrograms are developped.
"
What is the concept of arf in the context of networks and their structure?,"  As networks and their structure have become a major field of research, a
strong demand for network visualization has emerged. We address this challenge
by formalizing the well established spring layout in terms of dynamic
equations. We thus open up the design space for new algorithms. Drawing from
the knowledge of systems design, we derive a layout algorithm that remedies
several drawbacks of the original spring layout. This new algorithm relies on
the balancing of two antagonistic forces. We thus call it {\em arf} for
""attractive and repulsive forces"". It is, as we claim, particularly suited for
a dynamic layout of smaller networks ($n < 10^3$). We back this claim with
several application examples from on going complex systems research.
"
What is the 21-cm signal used as a detector of the hydrogen abundance?,"  New observations over the next few years of the emission of distant objects
will help unfold the chapter in cosmic history around the era of the first
galaxies. These observations will use the neutral hydrogen emission or
absorption at a wavelength of 21-cm as a detector of the hydrogen abundance. We
predict the signature on the 21-cm signal of the early generations of galaxies.
We calculate the 21-cm power spectrum including two physical effects that were
neglected in previous calculations. The first is the redistribution of the UV
photons from the first galaxies due to their scattering off of the neutral
hydrogen, which results in an enhancement of the 21-cm signal. The second is
the presence of an ionized hydrogen bubble near each source, which produces a
cutoff at observable scales. We show that the resulting clear signature in the
21-cm power spectrum can be used to detect and study the population of galaxies
that formed just 200 million years after the Big Bang.

What is the impact of Higgsino mass parameter on the prospects for direct detection of non-standard Higgs bosons?,"  In this article we analyze the impact of B-physics and Higgs physics at LEP
on standard and non-standard Higgs bosons searches at the Tevatron and the LHC,
within the framework of minimal flavor violating supersymmetric models. The
B-physics constraints we consider come from the experimental measurements of
the rare B-decays b -> s gamma and B_u -> tau nu and the experimental limit on
the B_s -> mu+ mu- branching ratio. We show that these constraints are severe
for large values of the trilinear soft breaking parameter A_t, rendering the
non-standard Higgs searches at hadron colliders less promising. On the contrary
these bounds are relaxed for small values of A_t and large values of the
Higgsino mass parameter mu, enhancing the prospects for the direct detection of
non-standard Higgs bosons at both colliders. We also consider the available
ATLAS and CMS projected sensitivities in the standard model Higgs search
channels, and we discuss the LHC's ability in probing the whole MSSM parameter
space. In addition we also consider the expected Tevatron collider
sensitivities in the standard model Higgs h -> b bbar channel to show that it
may be able to find 3 sigma evidence in the B-physics allowed regions for small
or moderate values of the stop mixing parameter.
"
What is the non-vanishing component of the electromagnetic field tensor F_{12}?,"  A plane-symmetric inhomogeneous cosmological model of perfect fluid
distribution with electro-magnetic field is obtained. The source of the
magnetic field is due to an electric current produced along the z-axis.
$F_{12}$ is the non-vanishing component of electromagnetic field tensor. To get
a deterministic solution, we assume the free gravitational field is Petrov
type-II non-degenerate. The behaviour of the electro-magnetic field tensor
together with some physical aspects of the model are also discussed.
"
What is the special case of the result for the algebra of multisymmetric polynomials over an arbitrary base ring?,"  First and second fundamental theorems are given for polynomial invariants of
a class of pseudo-reflection groups (including the Weyl groups of type $B_n$),
under the assumption that the order of the group is invertible in the base
field. Special case of the result is a finite presentation of the algebra of
multisymmetric polynomials. Reducedness of the invariant commuting scheme is
proved as a by-product. The algebra of multisymmetric polynomials over an
arbitrary base ring is revisited.
"
How do geometric concepts and objects of the physical geometry relate to the quantum theory and the theory of elementary particles?,"  The space-time geometry is considered to be a physical geometry, i.e. a
geometry described completely by the world function. All geometrical concepts
and geometric objects are taken from the proper Euclidean geometry. They are
expressed via the Euclidean world function \sigma_E and declared to be concepts
and objects of any physical geometry, provided the Euclidean world function
\sigma_E is replaced by the world function \sigma of the physical geometry in
question. The set of physical geometries is more powerful, than the set of
Riemannian geometries, and one needs to choose a true space-time geometry. In
general, the physical geometry is multivariant (there are many vectors which
are equivalent to a given vector, but are not equivalent between themselves).
The multivariance admits one to describe quantum effects as geometric effects
and to consider existence of elementary particles as a geometrical problem,
when the possibility of the physical existence of an elementary geometric
object in the form of a physical body is determined by the space-time geometry.
Multivariance admits one to describe discrete and continuous geometries, using
the same technique. A use of physical geometry admits one to realize the
geometrical approach to the quantum theory and to the theory of elementary
particles.
"
What are the integral expressions for the solutions of the closure equations?,"  We apply a non-linear statistical method in turbulence to the cosmological
perturbation theory and derive a closed set of evolution equations for matter
power spectra. The resultant closure equations consistently recover the
one-loop results of standard perturbation theory and beyond that, it is still
capable of treating the non-linear evolution of matter power spectra. We find
the exact integral expressions for the solutions of closure equations. These
analytic expressions coincide with the renormalized one-loop results presented
by Crocce & Scoccimarro (2006,2007). By constructing the non-linear propagator,
we analytically evaluate the non-linear matter power spectra based on the
first-order Born approximation of the integral expressions and compare it with
those of the renormalized perturbation theory.
"
What are the key concepts in multipartite entanglement purification?,"  We give a review on entanglement purification for bipartite and multipartite
quantum states, with the main focus on theoretical work carried out by our
group in the last couple of years. We discuss entanglement purification in the
context of quantum communication, where we emphasize its close relation to
quantum error correction. Various bipartite and multipartite entanglement
purification protocols are discussed, and their performance under idealized and
realistic conditions is studied. Several applications of entanglement
purification in quantum communication and computation are presented, which
highlights the fact that entanglement purification is a fundamental tool in
quantum information processing.
"
What is the limiting eigenvalue distribution of n x n banded Toeplitz matrices as n goes to infinity?,"  We study the limiting eigenvalue distribution of $n\times n$ banded Toeplitz
matrices as $n\to \infty$. From classical results of Schmidt-Spitzer and
Hirschman it is known that the eigenvalues accumulate on a special curve in the
complex plane and the normalized eigenvalue counting measure converges weakly
to a measure on this curve as $n\to\infty$. In this paper, we characterize the
limiting measure in terms of an equilibrium problem. The limiting measure is
one component of the unique vector of measures that minimes an energy
functional defined on admissible vectors of measures. In addition, we show that
each of the other components is the limiting measure of the normalized counting
measure on certain generalized eigenvalues.
"
What is the decoherence in charge qubits formed by multiple lateral quantum dots in the spin-boson model?,"  We discuss decoherence in charge qubits formed by multiple lateral quantum
dots in the framework of the spin-boson model and the Born-Markov
approximation. We consider the intrinsic decoherence caused by the coupling to
bulk phonon modes. Two distinct quantum dot configurations are studied: (i)
Three quantum dots in a ring geometry with one excess electron in total and
(ii) arrays of quantum dots where the computational basis states form multipole
charge configurations. For the three-dot qubit, we demonstrate the possibility
of performing one- and two-qubit operations by solely tuning gate voltages.
Compared to the proposal by DiVincenzo {\it et al.} involving a linear
three-dot spin qubit, the three-dot charge qubit allows for less overhead on
two-qubit operations. For small interdot tunnel amplitudes, the three-dot
qubits have $Q$ factors much higher than those obtained for double dot systems.
The high-multipole dot configurations also show a substantial decrease in
decoherence at low operation frequencies when compared to the double-dot qubit.
"
What are the geometrical substructure of the water molecules in the graphite-(H$_{2}$O)$_{n}$ global minimum?,"  Likely candidates for the global potential energy minima of (H$_{2}$O)$_{n}$
clusters with $n\leq21$ on the (0001)-surface of graphite are found using
basin-hopping global optimization. The potential energy surfaces are
constructed using the TIP4P intermolecular potentials for the water molecules
(the TIP3P is also explored as a secondary choice), a Lennard-Jones
water-graphite potential, and a water-graphite polarization potential that is
built from classical electrostatic image methods and takes into account both
the perpendicular and parallel electric polarizations of graphite. This
potential energy surface produces a rather hydrophobic water-graphite
interaction. As a consequence, the water component of the lowest
graphite-(H$_{2}$O)$_{n}$ minima is quite closely related to low-lying minima
of the corresponding TIP4P (H$_{2}$O)$_{n}$ clusters. In about half of the
cases the geometrical substructure of the water molecules in the
graphite-(H$_{2}$O)$_{n}$ global minimum coincides with that of the
corresponding free water cluster. Exceptions occur when the interaction with
graphite induces a change in geometry. A comparison of our results with
available theoretical and experimental data is performed.
"
"What are the natures of the 87 FVWs that are not coincident with known SNRs, galaxies, or high-velocity clouds?","  We present the results of a search for faint HI 21-cm emission line wings at
velocities forbidden by Galactic rotation in the Galactic plane using the
Leiden/Dwingeloo HI Survey data and the HI Southern Galactic Plane Survey data.
These ``forbidden-velocity wings (FVWs)'' appear as protruding excessive
emission in comparison with their surroundings in limited (< 2 deg) spatial
regions over velocity extent more than ~20 km/s in large-scale (l-v) diagrams.
Their high-velocities imply that there should be some dynamical phenomena
associated. We have identified 87 FVWs. We present their catalog, and discuss
their distribution and statistical properties. We found that 85% of FVWs are
not coincident with known supernova remnants (SNRs), galaxies, or high-velocity
clouds. Their natures are currently unknown. We suspect that many of them are
fast-moving HI shells and filaments associated with the oldest SNRs that are
essentially invisible except via their HI line emission. We discuss other
possible origins.
"
What are the general expressions for the fluctuating electromagnetic field outside a homogeneous material surface?,"  We derive new general expressions for the fluctuating electromagnetic field
outside a homogeneous material surface. The analysis is based on general
results from the thermodynamics of irreversible processes, and requires no
consideration of the material interior, as it only uses knowledge of the
reflection amplitudes for its surface. Therefore, our results are valid for all
homogeneous surfaces, including layered systems and metamaterials, at all
temperatures. In particular, we obtain new formulae for the near-field region,
which are important for interpreting the numerous current experiments probing
proximity effects for macroscopic and/or microscopic bodies separated by small
empty gaps. By use of Onsager's reciprocity relations, we obtain also the
general symmetry properties that must be satisfied by the reflection matrix of
any material.
"
What are the classical and noncommutative index theorems in the context of a Lie groupoid?,"  Many index theorems (both classical and in noncommutative geometry) can be
interpreted in terms of a Lie groupoid acting properly on a manifold and
leaving an elliptic family of pseudodifferential operators invariant. Alain
Connes in his book raised the question of an index theorem in this general
context. In this paper, an analytic index for many such situations is
constructed. The approach is inspired by the classical families theorem of
Atiyah and Singer, and the proof generalizes, to the case of proper Lie
groupoid actions, some of the results proved for proper locally compact group
actions by N. C. Phillips.
"
What are the main theorems that classify small contravariant functors from spaces to spaces up to weak equivalence of functors?,"  In this paper we prove two theorems which resemble the classical
cohomological and homological Brown representability theorems. The main
difference is that our results classify small contravariant functors from
spaces to spaces up to weak equivalence of functors.
  In more detail, we show that every small contravariant functor from spaces to
spaces which takes coproducts to products up to homotopy and takes homotopy
pushouts to homotopy pullbacks is naturally weekly equivalent to a
representable functor.
  The second representability theorem states: every contravariant continuous
functor from the category of finite simplicial sets to simplicial sets taking
homotopy pushouts to homotopy pullbacks is equivalent to the restriction of a
representable functor. This theorem may be considered as a contravariant analog
of Goodwillie's classification of linear functors.
"
What is the mechanism of the phase transition in SrMoO4?,"  SrMoO4 was studied under compression up to 25 GPa by angle-dispersive x-ray
diffraction. A phase transition was observed from the scheelite-structured
ambient phase to a monoclinic fergusonite phase at 12.2(9) GPa with cell
parameters a = 5.265(9) A, b = 11.191(9) A, c = 5.195 (5) A, and beta = 90.9, Z
= 4 at 13.1 GPa. There is no significant volume collapse at the phase
transition. No additional phase transitions were observed and on release of
pressure the initial phase is recovered, implying that the observed structural
modifications are reversible. The reported transition appeared to be a
ferroelastic second-order transformation producing a structure that is a
monoclinic distortion of the low-pressure phase and was previously observed in
compounds isostructural to SrMoO4. A possible mechanism for the transition is
proposed and its character is discussed in terms of the present data and the
Landau theory. Finally, the EOS is reported and the anisotropic compressibility
of the studied crystal is discussed in terms of the compression of the Sr-O and
Mo-O bonds.
"
What are the implications of the near-side yields in hadron-hadron correlations?,"  High-$p_T$ hadron-hadron correlations have been measured with the PHENIX
experiment in $\Cu$ and $\pp$ collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200$ GeV. A
comparison of the jet widths and yields between the two colliding systems
allows us to study the medium effect on jets. We also present a first
measurement of direct photon-hadron correlations in $\Au$ and $\pp$ collisions.
We find that the near-side yields are consistent with zero in both systems. By
comparing the jet yields on the away side, we observe a suggestion of the
expected suppression of hadrons associated with photons in $\Au$ collisions.
"
What are the implications of approximate ground state functionals used in DFT based transport calculations for correlated electron systems?,"  A method is presented, which employs the density matrix renormalization group
technique in order to construct exact ground state exchange correlation
functionals for models of correlated electron systems coupled to external
reservoirs. The technique is applied to the M-site resonant level model. We
calculate its exact Kubo-conductance, which is available within DMRG, and
compare to the single-particle conductance obtained from Kohn-Sham energies and
orbitals of the exact ground state density functional theory (DFT). It is found
that the position of transport resonances is reproduced essentially exactly,
while deviations in the level broadening can be less than 1% and do not exceed
10%. Our findings lend strong support to a recently held point of view, namely
that approximations in the ground state functionals used in DFT based transport
calculations can lead to drastic errors in transport calculations while
exchange correlation contributions to the induced effective potential tend to
be less significant.
"
"How does the halo mass, galaxy spin, and star formation efficiency affect the apparition of a supernovae-driven wind in a disk galaxy?","  We studied the effect of supernovae feedback on a disk galaxy, taking into
account the impact of infalling gas on both the star formation history and the
corresponding outflow structure, the apparition of a supernovae-driven wind
being highly sensitive to the halo mass, the galaxy spin and the star formation
efficiency. We model our galaxies as cooling and collapsing NFW spheres. The
dark matter component is modelled as a static external potential, while the
baryon component is described by the Euler equations using the AMR code RAMSES.
Metal-dependent cooling and supernovae-heating are also implemented using
state-of-the-art recipes coming from cosmological simulations. We allow for 3
parameters to vary: the halo circular velocity, the spin parameter and the star
formation efficiency. We found that the ram pressure of infalling material is
the key factor limiting the apparition of galactic winds. We obtain a very low
feedback efficiency, with supernovae to wind energy conversion factor around
one percent, so that only low cicrular velocity galaxies give rise to strong
winds. For massive galaxies, we obtain a galatic fountain, for which we discuss
the observational properties. We conclude that for quiescent isolated galaxies,
galactic winds appear only in very low mass systems. Although that can quite
efficiently enrich the IGM with metals, they don't carry away enough cold
material to solve the overcooling problem.
"
What is the role of the ratio of the equivalent Stroemgren radius to the stellar offset distance in determining the ionization front expansion in a star-forming medium?,"  The expansion of ionization fronts in uniform and spherically symmetric
power-law density distributions is a well-studied topic. However, in many
situations, such as a star formed at the edge of a molecular cloud core, an
offset power-law density distribution would be more appropriate. In this paper
a few of the main issues of the formation and expansion of HII regions in such
media are outlined and results are presented for the particular cases where the
underlying power laws are 1/r^2 and 1/r^3. A simple criterion is developed for
determining whether the initial photoionized region will be unbounded, which
depends on the power-law exponent and the ratio of the equivalent Stroemgren
radius produced by the star in a uniform medium to the stellar offset distance.
In the expansion stage, the ionized volumes will eventually become unbounded
unless pressure balance with the external medium is reached before the
ionization front velocity becomes supersonic with respect to the ionized gas.
"
What is the Master Stability Function used to assess the controllability of a complex network?,"  In a recent paper, it has been suggested that the controllability of a
diffusively coupled complex network, subject to localized feedback loops at
some of its vertices, can be assessed by means of a Master Stability Function
approach, where the network controllability is defined in terms of the spectral
properties of an appropriate Laplacian matrix. Following that approach, a
comparison study is reported here among different network topologies in terms
of their controllability. The effects of heterogeneity in the degree
distribution, as well as of degree correlation and community structure, are
discussed.
"
What are the differences in the decay of the meeting probability between distinguishable particles and distinguishable particles?,"  We study the motion of two non-interacting quantum particles performing a
random walk on a line and analyze the probability that the two particles are
detected at a particular position after a certain number of steps (meeting
problem). The results are compared to the corresponding classical problem and
differences are pointed out. Analytic formulas for the meeting probability and
its asymptotic behavior are derived. The decay of the meeting probability for
distinguishable particles is faster then in the classical case, but not
quadratically faster. Entangled initial states and the bosonic or fermionic
nature of the walkers are considered.
"
What is the extension of Perelman's soul theorem for singular spaces?,"  In this paper, we study open complete metric spaces with non-negative
curvature. Among other things, we establish an extension of Perelman's soul
theorem for possibly singular spaces: ""Let X be a complete, non-compact, finite
dimensional Alexandrov space with non-negative curvature. Suppose that X has no
boundary and has positive curvature on a non-empty open subset. Then X must be
a contractible space"". The proof of this result uses the detailed analysis of
concavity of distance functions and Busemann functions on singular spaces with
non-negative curvature. We will introduce a family of angular excess functions
to measure convexity and extrinsic curvature of convex hypersurfaces in
singular spaces. We also derive a new comparison for trapezoids in
non-negatively curved spaces, which led to desired convexity estimates for the
proof of our new soul theorem.
"
What are the Cr I solar abundances derived from branching fraction measurements?,"  Branching fraction measurements from Fourier transform spectra in conjunction
with published radiative lifetimes are used to determine transition
probabilities for 263 lines of neutral chromium. These laboratory values are
employed to derive a new photospheric abundance for the Sun: log $\epsilon$(Cr
I)$_{\odot}$ = 5.64$\pm$0.01 ($\sigma = 0.07$). These Cr I solar abundances do
not exhibit any trends with line strength nor with excitation energy and there
were no obvious indications of departures from LTE. In addition, oscillator
strengths for singly-ionized chromium recently reported by the FERRUM Project
are used to determine: log $\epsilon$(Cr II)$_{\odot}$ = 5.77$\pm$0.03 ($\sigma
= 0.13$). Transition probability data are also applied to the spectra of three
stars: HD 75732 (metal-rich dwarf), HD 140283 (metal-poor subgiant), and CS
22892-052 (metal-poor giant). In all of the selected stars, Cr I is found to be
underabundant with respect to Cr II. The possible causes for this abundance
discrepancy and apparent ionization imbalance are discussed.
"
What are the implications of interacting matter with non-abelian gauge fields in quantum field theories?,"  Twisted quantum field theories on the Groenewold-Moyal plane are known to be
non-local. Despite this non-locality, it is possible to define a generalized
notion of causality. We show that interacting quantum field theories that
involve only couplings between matter fields, or between matter fields and
minimally coupled U(1) gauge fields are causal in this sense. On the other
hand, interactions between matter fields and non-abelian gauge fields violate
this generalized causality. We derive the modified Feynman rules emergent from
these features. They imply that interactions of matter with non-abelian gauge
fields are not Lorentz- and CPT-invariant.
"
What are the implications of the improved inequality on the speed of D-optimum design algorithms?,"  We improve the inequality used in Pronzato [2003. Removing non-optimal
support points in D-optimum design algorithms. Statist. Probab. Lett. 63,
223-228] to remove points from the design space during the search for a
$D$-optimum design. Let $\xi$ be any design on a compact space $\mathcal{X}
\subset \mathbb{R}^m$ with a nonsingular information matrix, and let
$m+\epsilon$ be the maximum of the variance function $d(\xi,\mathbf{x})$ over
all $\mathbf{x} \in \mathcal{X}$. We prove that any support point
$\mathbf{x}_{*}$ of a $D$-optimum design on $\mathcal{X}$ must satisfy the
inequality $d(\xi,\mathbf{x}_{*}) \geq
m(1+\epsilon/2-\sqrt{\epsilon(4+\epsilon-4/m)}/2)$. We show that this new lower
bound on $d(\xi,\mathbf{x}_{*})$ is, in a sense, the best possible, and how it
can be used to accelerate algorithms for $D$-optimum design.
"
How is the logical Bell state generated from the DFS?,"  We demonstrate coherent control of two logical qubits encoded in a
decoherence free subspace (DFS) of four dipolar-coupled protons in an NMR
quantum information processor. A pseudo-pure fiducial state is created in the
DFS, and a unitary logical qubit entangling operator evolves the system to a
logical Bell state. The four-spin molecule is partially aligned by a liquid
crystal solvent, which introduces strong dipolar couplings among the spins.
Although the system Hamiltonian is never fully specified, we demonstrate high
fidelity control over the logical degrees of freedom. In fact, the DFS encoding
leads to higher fidelity control than is available in the full four-spin
Hilbert space.
"
What are the expressions for some bulk correlators not yet computed in the boundary?,"  We extend to chiral N=4 operators the holographic agreement recently found
between correlators of the symmetric orbifold of M^4 at large N and type IIB
strings propagating in AdS(3) x S^3 x M^4, where M^4=T^4 or K3. We also present
expressions for some bulk correlators not yet computed in the boundary.
"
What are the computational tools of the Bayesian estimation?,"  In this paper, first a great number of inverse problems which arise in
instrumentation, in computer imaging systems and in computer vision are
presented. Then a common general forward modeling for them is given and the
corresponding inversion problem is presented. Then, after showing the
inadequacy of the classical analytical and least square methods for these ill
posed inverse problems, a Bayesian estimation framework is presented which can
handle, in a coherent way, all these problems. One of the main steps, in
Bayesian inversion framework is the prior modeling of the unknowns. For this
reason, a great number of such models and in particular the compound hidden
Markov models are presented. Then, the main computational tools of the Bayesian
estimation are briefly presented. Finally, some particular cases are studied in
detail and new results are presented.
"
What is the intersection of the escaping set with the Julia set in a meromorphic function with a logarithmic singularity over infinity?,"  We show that if a meromorphic function has a direct singularity over
infinity, then the escaping set has an unbounded component and the intersection
of the escaping set with the Julia set contains continua. This intersection has
an unbounded component if and only if the function has no Baker wandering
domains. We also give estimates of the Hausdorff dimension and the upper box
dimension of the Julia set of a meromorphic function with a logarithmic
singularity over infinity. The above theorems are deduced from more general
results concerning functions which have ""direct or logarithmic tracts"", but
which need not be meromorphic in the plane. These results are obtained by using
a generalization of Wiman-Valiron theory. The method is also applied to complex
differential equations.
"
What are the Roothaan-Hall formalism and its relation to the construction and selection of Gaussian basis sets in Quantum Chemistry?,"  We present here a review of the fundamental topics of Hartree-Fock theory in
Quantum Chemistry. From the molecular Hamiltonian, using and discussing the
Born-Oppenheimer approximation, we arrive to the Hartree and Hartree-Fock
equations for the electronic problem. Special emphasis is placed in the most
relevant mathematical aspects of the theoretical derivation of the final
equations, as well as in the results regarding the existence and uniqueness of
their solutions. All Hartree-Fock versions with different spin restrictions are
systematically extracted from the general case, thus providing a unifying
framework. Then, the discretization of the one-electron orbitals space is
reviewed and the Roothaan-Hall formalism introduced. This leads to a exposition
of the basic underlying concepts related to the construction and selection of
Gaussian basis sets, focusing in algorithmic efficiency issues. Finally, we
close the review with a section in which the most relevant modern developments
(specially those related to the design of linear-scaling methods) are commented
and linked to the issues discussed. The whole work is intentionally
introductory and rather self-contained, so that it may be useful for non
experts that aim to use quantum chemical methods in interdisciplinary
applications. Moreover, much material that is found scattered in the literature
has been put together here to facilitate comprehension and to serve as a handy
reference.
"
What are the sufficient and necessary conditions for the extension of an isometry of subspaces?,"  We extend Witt's theorem to several kinds of simultaneous isometries of
subspaces. We determine sufficient and necessary conditions for the extension
of an isometry of subspaces $\phi:E\to E'$ to an isometry $\phi_V:V\to V'$ that
also sends a given subspace to another, or a given self-dual flag to another,
or a Witt's decomposition to another and a special self-dual flag to another.
We also determine sufficient and necessary conditions for the isometry of
generic flags or the simultaneous isometry of (subspace, self-dual flag) pairs.
"
How do massive neutrinos affect the bound on the axion mass?,"  Relic thermal axions could play the role of an extra hot dark matter
component in cosmological structure formation theories. By combining the most
recent observational data we improve previous cosmological bounds on the axion
mass m_a in the so-called hadronic axion window. We obtain a limit on the axion
mass m_a < 0.42eV at the 95% c.l. (m_a < 0.72eV at the 99% c.l.). A novel
aspect of the analysis presented here is the inclusion of massive neutrinos and
how they may affect the bound on the axion mass. If neutrino masses belong to
an inverted hierarchy scheme, for example, the above constraint is improved to
m_a < 0.38eV at the 95% c.l. (m_a < 0.67eV at the 99% c.l.). Future data from
experiments as CAST will provide a direct test of the cosmological bound.
"
What is the unit group of the group algebra K of a finite non-abelian group G?,"  Let $K$ be field of characteristic 2 and let $G$ be a finite non-abelian
2-group with the cyclic derived subgroup $G'$, and there exists a central
element $z$ of order 2 in $Z(G) \backslash G'$. We prove that the unit group of
the group algebra $KG$ possesses a section isomorphic to the wreath product of
a group of order 2 with the derived subgroup of the group $G$, giving for such
groups a positive answer to the question of A. Shalev.
"
What is the sum of the Yukawa and linear potential in a heavy quark-antiquark pair from gluodynamics in curved space-time?,"  We determine the static potential for a heavy quark-antiquark pair from
gluodynamics in curved space-time. Our calculation is done within the framework
of the gauge-invariant, path-dependent, variables formalism. The potential
energy is the sum of a Yukawa and a linear potential, leading to the
confinement of static charges.
"
What is the Frobenius action on a local ring of positive prime characteristic?,"  Given a local ring of positive prime characteristic there is a natural
Frobenius action on its local cohomology modules with support at its maximal
ideal. In this paper we study the local rings for which the local cohomology
modules have only finitely many submodules invariant under the Frobenius
action. In particular we prove that F-pure Gorenstein local rings as well as
the face ring of a finite simplicial complex localized or completed at its
homogeneous maximal ideal have this property. We also introduce the notion of
an anti-nilpotent Frobenius action on an Artinian module over a local ring and
use it to study those rings for which the lattice of submodules of the local
cohomology that are invariant under Frobenius satisfies the Ascending Chain
Condition.
"
What are the maximal surfaces with lightlike boundary of mirror symmetry in the Lorentz-Minkowski space L3?,"  In this paper we deal with the uniqueness of the Lorentzian helicoid and
Enneper's surface among properly embedded maximal surfaces with lightlike
boundary of mirror symmetry in the Lorentz-Minkowski space L3.
"
What is the origin of the coexistence of the large thermopower and the large conductivity in Na$_x$CoO$_2$?,"  In the present study, we pin down the origin of the coexistence of the large
thermopower and the large conductivity in Na$_x$CoO$_2$. It is revealed that
not just the density of states (DOS), the effective mass, nor the band width,
but the peculiar {\it shape} of the $a_{1g}$ band referred to as the ""pudding
mold"" type, which consists of a dispersive portion and a somewhat flat portion,
is playing an important role in this phenomenon. The present study provides a
new guiding principle for designing good thermoelectric materials.
"
What are the Joyce manifolds of the first kind?,"  The present paper deals with mirror symmetry aspects of compact ``barely''
$G_2$ manifolds, that is, $G_2$ manifolds of the form (CY$\times
S^1)/\mathbb{Z}_2$. We propose that the mirror of any barely $G_2$ manifold is
another barely one and which is constructed as a fibration of the \emph{mirror}
of the CY base. Also, we describe the Joyce manifolds of the first kind as
``barely'' and we show that the underlying CY of all the family is self-mirror
with $h^{1,1}=h^{2,1}=19$. We thus propose that the mirror of a Joyce space of
the first kind will be another Joyce space of the first kind.We also suggest
that this self-mirror CY family is dual to K3$\times S^1$ in the
heterotic/M-theory sense, and that arise as a particular case of the
Borcea-Voisin construction. As a spin-off we conclude from this analysis that
no 5-brane instantons are present in compactifications of eleven dimensional
supergravity over Joyce manifolds of the first kind.
"
What are the two-dimensional case and Boussinesq approximation used to examine small-scale perturbations of low-frequency modes?,"  The dynamics of linear perturbations is studied in magnetized plasma shear
flows with a constant shearing rate and with gravity-induced stratification.
The general set of linearized equations is derived and the two-dimensional case
is considered in detail. The Boussinesq approximation is used in order to
examine relatively small-scale perturbations of low-frequency modes:
Gravito-Alfven waves (GAW) and Entropy Mode (EM) perturbations. It is shown
that for flows with arbitrary shearing rate there exists a finite time interval
of non-adiabatic evolution of the perturbations. The non-adiabatic behavior
manifests itself in a twofold way, viz. by the over-reflection of the GAWs and
by the generation of GAWs from EM perturbations. It is shown that these
phenomena act as efficient transformers of the equilibrium flow energy into the
energy of the perturbations for moderate and high shearing rate solar plasma
flows. Efficient generation of GAW by EM takes place for shearing rates about
an order of magnitude smaller than necessary for development of a shear
instability. The latter fact could have important consequences for the problem
of angular momentum redistribution within the Sun and solar-type stars.
"
What are the spatial dimensions of the components of the close binary system SS Lep characterized with IR interferometry?,"  Stellar evolution in close binary systems is strongly influenced by mass
transfer from one star to the other when one component fills its zero-velocity
surface or Roche Lobe. SS Lep is a fairly nearby close binary showing the Algol
paradox and a shell spectrum, both indicative of (past) mass transfer. To study
the process of mass transfer and its evolutionary consequences, we aim at a
direct characterisation of the spatial dimensions of the different components
of SS Lep with IR interferometry. We use VINCI/VLTI interferometric
observations in the K band and photometric observations from the UV to the
far-IR. The visibilities are interpreted with simple geometrical models and the
Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) is decomposed into the three main
components: A star, M star and dust shell/disk. From the SED, we find that the
main emitters in the K band are the M star and the circumstellar environment.
Both are spatially resolved with the VINCI observations, showing the excess to
be circumbinary and showing the M star to have a size equal to its Roche Lobe.
We conclude that we have, for the first time, directly resolved a star filling
its Roche Lobe. The resulting mass transfer is probably the cause of (1) the
circumbinary dust disk of which we see the hot inner region spatially resolved
in our observations, (2) the unusually high luminosity of the A star and (3)
the shell spectrum seen in the UV and optical spectra.
"
What is the system-size dependence of particle production in heavy-ion collisions?,"  The system-size dependence of particle production in heavy-ion collisions at
the top SPS energy is analyzed in terms of the statistical model. A systematic
comparison is made of two suppression mechanisms that quantify strange particle
yields in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions: the canonical model with
strangeness correlation radius determined from the data and the model
formulated in the canonical ensemble using chemical off-equilibrium strangeness
suppression factor. The system-size dependence of the correlation radius and
the thermal parameters are obtained for p-p, C-C, Si-Si and Pb-Pb collisions at
sqrt(s_NN) = 17.3 AGeV. It is shown that on the basis of a consistent set of
data there is no clear difference between the two suppression patterns. In the
present study the strangeness correlation radius was found to exhibit a rather
weak dependence on the system size.
"
What is the group of automorphisms fixing every normal subgroup of a nilpotent-by-abelian group of derived length at most 3?,"  Among other things, we prove that the group of automorphisms fixing every
normal subgroup of a nilpotent-by-abelian group is nilpotent-by-metabelian. In
particular, the group of automorphisms fixing every normal subgroup of a
metabelian group is soluble of derived length at most 3. An example shows that
this bound cannot be improved.
"
What is the origin of magnetism in nanographenes?,"  Magnetism in nanographenes (also know as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, or
PAHs) are studied with first principles density functional calculations. We
find that an antiferromagnetic (AFM) phase appears as the PAH reaches a certain
size. This AFM phase in PAHs has the same origin as the one in infinitely long
zigzag-edged graphene nanoribbons, namely, from the localized electronic state
at the zigzag edge. The smallest PAH still having an AFM ground state is
identified. With increased length of the zigzag edge, PAHs approach an
infinitely long ribbon in terms of (1) the energetic ordering and difference
among the AFM, ferromagnetic (FM), and nonmagnetic (NM) phases and (2) the
average local magnetic moment at the zigzag edges. These PAHs serve as ideal
targets for chemical synthesis of nanographenes that possess magnetic
properties. Moreover, our calculations support the interpretation that
experimentally observed magnetism in activated carbon fibers originates from
the zigzag edges of the nanographenes.
"
What are the implications of the structural phase transitions of SrRuO3 thin films?,"  Temperature dependent structural phase transitions of SrRuO3 thin films
epitaxially grown on SrTiO3(001) single crystal substrates have been studied
using high-resolution x-ray diffraction. In contrast to bulk SrRuO3, coherently
strained epitaxial layers do not display cubic symmetry up to ~730 oC and
remain tetragonal. Such behavior is believed to be induced by compressive
strain between the SrRuO3 layer and SrTiO3 substrate due to lattice mismatch.
The tetragonal symmetry during growth explains the single domain growth on
miscut SrTiO3 substrates with step edges running along the [100] or [010]
direction.
"
What are the limits of the dipole scattering amplitude in the saturation regime?,"  We propose a new description of inclusive diffraction in deep inelastic
scattering (DIS). The diffractive structure functions are expressed in the
dipole picture and contain heavy-quark contributions. The dipole scattering
amplitude, a saturation model fitted on inclusive DIS data, features a
saturation scale Q_s(x) larger than 1 GeV for x=10^{-5}. The q\bar{q}g
contribution to the diffractive final state is modeled in such a way that both
the large-Q^2 and small-beta limits are implemented. In the regime xpom<0.01 in
which saturation is expected to be relevant, we obtain a parameter-free
description of the HERA data with chi^2/points=1.2.
"
What are the effects of the atomic saw method on the allowed energies in GaAs d-doped superlattices?,"  The ""atomic saw method"" uses the passage of dislocations in two-dimensional
(2D) quantum-well superlattices to create periodic slipping layers and
one-dimensional (1D) quantum wire superlattices. The effects of this space
structuring of the samples on the allowed energies are analysed in the case of
GaAs d-doped superlattices. If they are sufficiently large, the various
minigaps appearing in the 1D band structure could be responsible for the
presence of negative differential resistance (NDR) with high critical current
in these systems. The purpose is to determine the evolution of the minigaps in
terms of the sample parameters and to obtain the means to determine both the 2D
and 1D structural characteristics where NDR could appear.
"
What is the constraint that limits the bandwidth of operation?,"  Using the idea of transformation medium, a cloak can be designed to make a
domain invisible for one target frequency. In this article, we examine the
possibility to extend the bandwidth of such a cloak. We obtained a constraint
of the band width, which is summarized as a simple inequality that states that
limits the bandwidth of operation. The constraint originates from causality
requirements. We suggest a simple strategy that can get around the constraint.
"
Can phages be engineered to act as probes specific for a variety of antigens and biological threat agents?,"  Filamentous phage, such as fd used in this study, are thread-shaped bacterial
viruses. Their outer coat is a tube formed by thousands equal copies of the
major coat protein pVIII. We constructed libraries of random peptides fused to
all pVIII domains and selected phages that act as probes specific for a panel
of test antigens and biological threat agents. Because the viral carrier is
infective, phage borne bio-selective probes can be cloned individually and
propagated indefinitely without needs of their chemical synthesis or
reconstructing. We demonstrated the feasibility of using landscape phages and
their stripped fusion proteins as new bioselective materials that combine
unique characteristics of affinity reagents and self assembling membrane
proteins. Biorecognition layers fabricated from phage-derived probes bind
biological agents and generate detectable signals. The performance of
phage-derived materials as biorecognition films was illustrated by detection of
streptavidin-coated beads, Bacillus anthracis spores and Salmonella typhimurium
cells. With further refinement, the phage-derived analytical platforms for
detecting and monitoring of numerous threat agents may be developed, since the
biodetector films may be obtained from landscape phages selected against any
bacteria, virus or toxin. As elements of field-use detectors, they are superior
to antibodies, since they are inexpensive, highly specific and strong binders,
resistant to high temperatures and environmental stresses.
"
What are the distinct spin wave modes observed in a ferromagnet with finite size?,"  Further experiments showed the incorrectness of proposed interpretation.
"
What is the relationship between the observed break in the magnetic energy spectrum and the dissipation range spectral indices?,"  We present a cascade model for turbulence in weakly collisional plasmas that
follows the nonlinear cascade of energy from the large scales of driving in the
MHD regime to the small scales of the kinetic Alfven wave regime where the
turbulence is dissipated by kinetic processes. Steady-state solutions of the
model for the slow solar wind yield three conclusions: (1) beyond the observed
break in the magnetic energy spectrum, one expects an exponential cut-off; (2)
the widely held interpretation that this dissipation range obeys power-law
behavior is an artifact of instrumental sensitivity limitations; and, (3) over
the range of parameters relevant to the solar wind, the observed variation of
dissipation range spectral indices from -2 to -4 is naturally explained by the
varying effectiveness of Landau damping, from an undamped prediction of -7/3 to
a strongly damped index around -4.
"
What are the difficulties in implementing a non-Abelian topologically ordered ground state in a proposed model?,"  Certain proposed extended Bose-Hubbard models may exhibit topologically
ordered ground states with excitations obeying non-Abelian braid statistics. A
sufficient tuning of Hubbard parameters could yield excitation braiding rules
allowing implementation of a universal set of topologically protected quantum
gates. We discuss potential difficulties in realizing a model with a proposed
non-Abelian topologically ordered ground state using optical lattices
containing bosonic dipoles. Our direct implementation scheme does not realize
the necessary anisotropic hopping, anisotropic interactions, and low
temperatures.
"
How can tunneling contributions be measured in the differential conductance or in the bias voltage derivative?,"  We address Fano-like interference effects in scanning tunneling microscopy
(STM) measurements of nanoscale systems, e.g. two-level systems. Common for
these systems is that second order tunneling contributions give rise to
interference effects that cause suppressed transmission through the system for
certain energies. The suppressed transmission is measurable either in the
differential conductance or in the bias voltage derivative thereof.
"
What is the criterion for dissipation of alternating fields at the termination shock of the striped pulsar wind?,"  Most of the rotational luminosity of a pulsar is carried away by a
relativistic magnetised wind in which the matter energy flux is negligible
compared to the Poynting flux. Near the equatorial plane of an obliquely
rotating pulsar magnetosphere, the magnetic field reverses polarity with the
pulsar period, forming a wind with oppositely directed field lines. This
structure is called a striped wind; dissipation of alternating fields in the
striped wind is the object of our study.
  The aim of this paper is to study the conditions required for magnetic energy
release at the termination shock of the striped pulsar wind. Magnetic
reconnection is considered via analytical methods and 1D relativistic PIC
simulations.
  An analytical condition on the upstream parameters for partial and full
magnetic reconnection is derived from the conservation laws of energy, momentum
and particle number density across the relativistic shock. Furthermore, by
using a 1D relativistic PIC code, we study in detail the reconnection process
at the termination shock.
  We found a very simple criterion for dissipation of alternating fields at the
termination shock, depending on the upstream parameters of the flow. 1D
relativistic PIC simulations are in agreement with our criterion.
  Thus, alternating magnetic fields annihilate easily at relativistic highly
magnetised shocks.
"
What is the classical incantation that inspires the deterministic world?,"  It is argued that 't Hooft's deterministic program does not disenchant the
quantum world but rather inspires the incantation of the classical one.
"
How is the electronic behavior of a stretched DNA helix described using a tight-binding model?,"  When the DNA double helix is subjected to external forces it can stretch
elastically to elongations reaching 100% of its natural length. These
distortions, imposed at the mesoscopic or macroscopic scales, have a dramatic
effect on electronic properties at the atomic scale and on electrical transport
along DNA. Accordingly, a multiscale approach is necessary to capture the
electronic behavior of the stretched DNA helix. To construct such a model, we
begin with accurate density-functional-theory calculations for electronic
states in DNA bases and base pairs in various relative configurations
encountered in the equilibrium and stretched forms. These results are
complemented by semi-empirical quantum mechanical calculations for the states
of a small size [18 base pair poly(CG)-poly(CG)] dry, neutral DNA sequence,
using previously published models for stretched DNA. The calculated electronic
states are then used to parametrize an effective tight-binding model that can
describe electron hopping in the presence of environmental effects, such as the
presence of stray water molecules on the backbone or structural features of the
substrate. These effects introduce disorder in the model hamiltonian which
leads to electron localization. The localization length is smaller by several
orders of magnitude in stretched DNA relative to that in the unstretched
structure.
"
What are the effects of the film thickness on the superconducting energy gap in an Al-alox-Al junction?,"  Within the context of superconducting gap engineering, Al-\alox-Al tunnel
junctions have been used to study the variation in superconducting gap,
$\Delta$, with film thickness. Films of thickness 5, 7, 10 and 30 nm were used
to form the small area superconductor-insulator-superconductor (SIS) tunnel
junctions. In agreement with previous measurements we have observed an increase
in the superconducting energy gap of aluminium with a decrease in film
thickness. In addition, we find grain size in small area films with thickness
\textbf{$\geq$} 10 nm has no appreciable effect on energy gap. Finally, we
utilize 7 and 30 nm films in a single Cooper-pair transistor, and observe the
modification of the finite bias transport processes due to the engineered gap
profile.
"
What are the effects of paraphotons in optical precision experiments?,"  Optical precision experiments are a powerful tool to explore hidden sectors
of a variety of standard-model extensions with potentially tiny couplings to
photons. An important example is given by extensions involving an extra light
U(1) gauge degree of freedom, so-called paraphotons, with gauge-kinetic mixing
with the normal photon. These models naturally give rise to minicharged
particles which can be searched for with optical experiments. In this paper, we
study the effects of paraphotons in such experiments. We describe in detail the
role of a magnetic field for photon-paraphoton oscillations in models with
low-mass minicharged particles. In particular, we find that the upcoming
light-shining-through-walls experiments are sensitive to paraphotons and can
distinguish them from axion-like particles.
"
What is the relationship between the Wheeler-DeWitt equation and the Wheeler-DeWitt equation with Bianchi I universe?,"  In the analysis of the Wheeler-DeWitt equation, we have simplified the
Hamiltonian constraint of the Wheeler-DeWitt equation using the coordinate
transformation. The coordinate is choose such that metric becomes diagonal and
as Gaussian normal coordinate. Or we treat small universe so that the metric
become diagonal and universe is covered by Gaussian normal coordinates. We have
solved the Wheeler-DeWitt equation of such universes. Such that universe
contains Biancki I type universe or the black hole universe.
"
What is the Helmholtz equation in optics used to describe a wide family of wave-like phenomena?,"  The analysis of the Helmholtz equation is shown to lead to an exact
Hamiltonian system of equations describing in terms of ray trajectories a very
wide family of wave-like phenomena (including diffraction and interference)
going much beyond the limits of the ordinary geometrical optics approximation,
which is contained as a simple limiting case. Due to the fact that the time
independent Schroedinger equation is itself a Helmoltz-like equation, the same
mathematical solutions holding for a classical optical beam turn out to apply
to a quantum particle beam, leading to a complete system of Hamiltonian
equations which provide a set of particle trajectories and motion laws
containing as a limiting case the ones encountered in classical Mechanics.
"
What are the results of the dynamical simulations for the search for additional planets in the HD 45350 and 16 Cyg B systems?,"  Long time coverage and high radial velocity precision have allowed for the
discovery of additional objects in known planetary systems. Many of the
extrasolar planets detected have highly eccentric orbits, which raises the
question of how likely those systems are to host additional planets. We
investigate six systems which contain a very eccentric (e>0.6) planet: HD 3651,
HD 37605, HD 45350, HD 80606, HD 89744, and 16 Cyg B. We present updated
radial-velocity observations and orbital solutions, search for additional
planets, and perform test particle simulations to find regions of dynamical
stability. The dynamical simulations show that short-period planets could exist
in the HD 45350 and 16 Cyg B systems, and we use the observational data to set
tight detection limits, which rule out additional planets down to a few Neptune
masses in the HD 3651, HD 45350, and 16 Cyg B systems.
"
What are the applications of the lossless and lossy coding techniques of images?,"  In this paper we give a short theoretical description of the general
predictive adaptive arithmetic coding technique. The links between this
technique and the works of J. Rissanen in the 80's, in particular the BIC
information criterion used in parametrical model selection problems, are
established. We also design lossless and lossy coding techniques of images. The
lossless technique uses a mix between fixed-length coding and arithmetic coding
and provides better compression results than those separate methods. That
technique is also seen to have an interesting application in the domain of
statistics since it gives a data-driven procedure for the non-parametrical
histogram selection problem. The lossy technique uses only predictive adaptive
arithmetic codes and shows how a good choice of the order of prediction might
lead to better results in terms of compression. We illustrate those coding
techniques on a raw grayscale image.
"
What are the coefficients R and T used in the Schwarzschild-de Sitter black hole metric?,"  The Nariai black hole, whose two horizons are lying close to each other, is
an extreme and important case in the research of black hole. In this paper we
study the evolution of a massless scalar field scattered around in 5D
Schwarzschild-de Sitter black string space. Using the method shown by Brevik
and Simonsen (2001) we solve the scalar field equation as a boundary value
problem, where real boundary condition is employed. Then with convenient
replacement of the 5D continuous potential by square barrier, the reflection
and transmission coefficients ($R, T$) are obtained. At last, we also compare
the coefficients with usual 4D counterpart.
"
What is the ratio of the semi-major and semi-minor axis scale lengths of the Galactic bar?,"  Red clump giant stars can be used as distance indicators to trace the mass
distribution of the Galactic bar. We use RCG stars from 44 bulge fields from
the OGLE-II microlensing collaboration database to constrain analytic tri-axial
models for the Galactic bar. We find the bar major axis is oriented at an angle
of 24 - 27 degrees to the Sun-Galactic centre line-of-sight. The ratio of
semi-major and semi-minor bar axis scale lengths in the Galactic plane x_0,
y_0, and vertical bar scale length z_0, is x_0 : y_0 : z_0 = 10 : 3.5 : 2.6,
suggesting a slightly more prolate bar structure than the working model of
Gerhard (2002) which gives the scale length ratios as x_0 : y_0 : z_0 = 10 : 4
: 3 .
"
What are the observational techniques used to detect the gamma-ray emission?,"  We report the detection of a new source of very high energy (VHE, E_gamma >=
100GeV) gamma-ray emission located close to the Galactic Plane, MAGIC
J0616+225, which is spatially coincident with SNR IC443. The observations were
carried out with the MAGIC telescope in the periods December 2005 - January
2006 and December 2006 - January 2007. Here we present results from this
source, leading to a VHE gamma-ray signal with a statistical significance of
5.7 sigma in the 2006/7 data and a measured differential gamma-ray flux
consistent with a power law, described as dN_gamma/(dA dt dE) = (1.0 +/-
0.2)*10^(-11)(E/0.4 TeV)^(-3.1 +/- 0.3) cm^(-2)s^(-1)TeV^(-1). We briefly
discuss the observational technique used and the procedure implemented for the
data analysis. The results are put in the perspective of the multiwavelength
emission and the molecular environment found in the region of IC443.
"
What are the MaxEP and gradient response principles in non-linear non-equilibrium systems?,"  In the last few decades, some hypotheses for entropy production (EP)
principles have been forwarded as possible candidates for organizational
principles in non-linear non- equilibrium systems. Two important hypotheses
will be studied: the maximum entropy production (MaxEP) principle that claims
that the selected steady state has the highest EP, and the gradient response
principle that claims that the EP of the selected steady state (maximally)
increases when the external thermodynamic driving force increases. We will
formulate these hypotheses more rigorously and present a simple chemical
reaction model to test these hypotheses. With the help of this model, we will
clearly demonstrate that there are different MaxEP hypotheses being discussed
in the literature and we will look at some parts in the literature where these
differences are not always clarified. Furthermore, our chemical model will be a
general counter example to all of these MaxEP and gradient response hypotheses.
"
What are the results of the branching fractions measured by the Belle detector?,"  We have measured branching fractions of hadronic $\tau$ decays involving an
$\eta$ meson using 485 fb^{-1} of data collected with the Belle detector at the
KEKB asymmetric-energy e^+e^- collider. We obtain the following branching
fractions: ${\cal B}(\tau^-\to K^- \eta \nu_{\tau})=(1.62\pm 0.05 \pm
0.09)\times 10^{-4}$, ${\cal B}(\tau^-\to K^- \pi^0 \eta \nu_{\tau}) =(4.7\pm
1.1 \pm 0.4)\times 10^{-5}$, ${\cal B}(\tau^-\to \pi^- \pi^0 \eta
\nu_{\tau})=(1.39 \pm 0.03 \pm 0.07) \times 10^{-3}$, and ${\cal B}(\tau^-\to
K^{*-} \eta \nu_{\tau})=(1.13\pm 0.19 \pm 0.07)\times 10^{-4}$ improving the
accuracy compared to the best previous measurements by factors of six, eight,
four and four, respectively.
"
What are the implications of the evolution equation by Q-curvature in the interior of the manifold for the mean curvature to be zero and the T-curvature at the boundary?,"  Given a compact four dimensional smooth Riemannian manifold $(M,g)$ with
smooth boundary, we consider the evolution equation by $Q$-curvature in the
interior keeping the $T$-curvature and the mean curvature to be zero and the
evolution equation by $T$-curvature at the boundary with the condition that the
$Q$-curvature and the mean curvature vanish. Using integral method, we prove
global existence and convergence for the $Q$-curvature flow (resp $T$-curvature
flow) to smooth metric of prescribed $Q$-curvature (resp
  $T$-curvature) under conformally invariant assumptions.
"
What is the application of torsion energy in the interpretation of supernovae type Ia observations?,"  In the present work, torsion energy is defined. Its law of conservation is
given. It is shown that this type of energy gives rise to a repulsive force
which can be used to interpret supernovae type Ia observations, and
consequently the accelerating expansion of the Universe. This interpretation is
a pure geometric one and is a direct application of the geometrization
philosophy. Torsion energy can also be used to solve other problems of General
Relativity especially the singularity problem.
"
What is the relationship between conformal gravity and the cosmological constant problem?,"  The cosmological constant problem and the compatibility of gravity with
quantum mechanics are the two most pressing problems in all of gravitational
theory. While string theory nicely addresses the latter, it has so far failed
to provide any compelling solution to the former. On the other hand, while
conformal gravity nicely addresses the cosmological constant problem (by
naturally quenching the amount by which the cosmological constant gravitates
rather than by quenching the cosmological constant itself), the fourth order
derivative conformal theory has long been thought to possess a ghost when
quantized. However, it has recently been shown by Bender and Mannheim that not
only do theories based on fourth order derivative equations of motion not have
ghosts, they actually never had any to begin with, with the apparent presence
of ghosts being due entirely to treating operators which were not Hermitian on
the real axis as though they were. When this is taken care of via an underlying
$\cal P$$\cal T$ symmetry that such theories are found to possess, there are
then no ghosts at all and the $S$-matrix is fully unitary. Conformal gravity is
thus advanced as a fully consistent four-dimensional alternative to
ten-dimensional string theory.
"
What is the thermodynamics of a black hole solution dual to a SQCD-like plasma?,"  We study the thermodynamics and the jet quenching parameter of a black hole
solution dual to a SQCD-like plasma which includes the backreaction of
fundamental flavors. The free energy is calculated in several ways, including
some recently proposed holographic renormalization prescriptions. The validity
of the latter is confirmed by the consistency with the other methods. The
resulting thermodynamic properties are similar to the Little String Theory
ones: the temperature is fixed at the Hagedorn value and the free energy is
vanishing. Finally, an accurate analysis of the relevant string configurations
shows that the jet quenching parameter is zero in this model, in agreement with
previous findings.
"
What are the key features of lake-star patterns in the natural world?,"  Star patterns, reminiscent of a wide range of diffusively controlled growth
forms from snowflakes to Saffman-Taylor fingers, are ubiquitous features of ice
covered lakes. Despite the commonality and beauty of these ``lake stars'' the
underlying physical processes that produce them have not been explained in a
coherent theoretical framework. Here we describe a simple mathematical model
that captures the principal features of lake-star formation; radial fingers of
(relatively warm) water-rich regions grow from a central source and evolve
through a competition between thermal and porous media flow effects in a
saturated snow layer covering the lake. The number of star arms emerges from a
stability analysis of this competition and the qualitative features of this
meter-scale natural phenomena are captured in laboratory experiments.
"
What are the characteristics of the SCGs?,"  Multi-wavelength observations of Hickson's Compact Groups (HCGs) have shown
that many of these groups are physical bound structures and are in different
stage of evolution, from spiral-dominated systems to almost merged objects.
Very few studies have analysed the Southern Compact Groups (SCGs) sample, which
is though to be younger that HCGs, due to an on average higher number of spiral
galaxies. We present here the first results from optical and radio observations
on a pilot sample of SCGs.
"
What are the experimental errors taken into account through the covariance matrix of the coefficients of the expansions?,"  The $\pi$N forward scattering data are analyzed using an expansion method,
where the invariant amplitudes are represented by expansions satisfying the
forward dispersion relations. The experimental errors of the data are taken
into account through the covariance matrix of the coefficients of the
expansions in a careful error analysis. From the results, some coefficients,
$c_{n0}^\pm$, of the subthreshold expansions have been calculated with proper
error bars.
"
What is the relationship between the mixing time and the number of scans?,"  This paper is concerned with sampling from the uniform distribution on
H-colourings of the n-vertex path using systematic scan Markov chains. An
H-colouring of the n-vertex path is a homomorphism from the n-vertex path to
some fixed graph H. We show that systematic scan for H-colourings of the
n-vertex path mixes in O(log n) scans for any fixed H. This is a significant
improvement over the previous bound on the mixing time which was O(n^5) scans.
Furthermore we show that for a slightly more restricted family of H (where any
two vertices are connected by a 2-edge path) systematic scan also mixes in
O(log n) scans for any scan order. Finally, for completeness, we show that a
random update Markov chain mixes in O(n log n) updates for any fixed H,
improving the previous bound on the mixing time from O(n^5) updates.
"
What are the implications of the Ehlers symmetry in Einstein-Liouville gravity for the inclusion of Taub-NUT instantons?,"  Motivated by applications to black hole physics and duality, we study the
effect of higher derivative corrections on the dimensional reduction of
four-dimensional Einstein, Einstein Liouville and Einstein-Maxwell gravity to
one direction, as appropriate for stationary, spherically symmetric solutions.
We construct a field redefinition scheme such that the one-dimensional
Lagrangian is corrected only by powers of first derivatives of the fields,
eliminating spurious modes and providing a suitable starting point for
quantization. We show that the Ehlers symmetry, broken by the leading $R^2$
corrections in Einstein-Liouville gravity, can be restored by including
contributions of Taub-NUT instantons. Finally, we give a preliminary discussion
of the duality between higher-derivative F-term corrections on the vector and
hypermultiplet branches in N=2 supergravity in four dimensions.
"
What is the relationship between the proposed achievable rate region and the capacity region for the Gaussian vector broadcast channel?,"  In this paper, we propose an achievable rate region for discrete memoryless
interference channels with conferencing at the transmitter side. We employ
superposition block Markov encoding, combined with simultaneous superposition
coding, dirty paper coding, and random binning to obtain the achievable rate
region. We show that, under respective conditions, the proposed achievable
region reduces to Han and Kobayashi achievable region for interference
channels, the capacity region for degraded relay channels, and the capacity
region for the Gaussian vector broadcast channel. Numerical examples for the
Gaussian case are given.
"
What are the results of the $\pi$-$\pi$ theorem for manifold pairs with boundaries?,"  Surgery obstruction of a normal map to a simple Poincare pair $(X,Y)$ lies in
the relative surgery obstruction group $L_*(\pi_1(Y)\to\pi_1(X))$. A well known
result of Wall, the so called $\pi$-$\pi$ theorem, states that in higher
dimensions a normal map of a manifold with boundary to a simple Poincare pair
with $\pi_1(X)\cong\pi_1(Y)$ is normally bordant to a simple homotopy
equivalence of pairs. In order to study normal maps to a manifold with a
submanifold, Wall introduced surgery obstruction group for manifold pairs
$LP_*$ and splitting obstruction groups $LS_*$. In the present paper we
formulate and prove for manifold pairs with boundaries the results which are
similar to the $\pi$-$\pi$ theorem. We give direct geometric proofs, which are
based on the original statements of Wall's results and apply obtained results
to investigate surgery on filtered manifolds.
"
"What are the Fayet model, the Polonyi model, and the O'Raifeartaigh model?","  We present simple string models which dynamically break supersymmetry without
non-Abelian gauge dynamics. The Fayet model, the Polonyi model, and the
O'Raifeartaigh model each arise from D-branes at a specific type of
singularity. D-brane instanton effects generate the requisite exponentially
small scale of supersymmetry breaking.
"
What are the results of the inclusive jet production measurements in proton-antiproton collisions?,"  Results on inclusive jet production in proton-antiproton collisions at
sqrt(s) =1.96 TeV based on 1 fb-1 of CDF Run II data are presented.
Measurements are preformed using the k_T algorithm in a wide range of jet
transverse momentum and jet rapidity. The measured cross sections are compared
to next-to-leading order perturbative QCD calculations.
"
What are the Nuclear Modification Factors (NMF) used to analyze the hadron species at RHIC and LHC?,"  We update our former analysis of the Nuclear Modification Factors (NMF) for
different hadron species at RHIC and LHC. This update is motivated by the new
experimental data from STAR which presents differences with the preliminary
data used to fix some of the parameters in our model. The main change is the
use of AKK fragmentation functions for the hard part of the spectrum and minor
adjustments of the coalescence (soft) contribution. We confirm that observation
of the NMF for the f_0 meson can shed light on its quark composition.
"
What are the characteristics of the bijection between the hyper-rectangle and the polytope?,"  We present a novel technique for encoding and decoding constant weight binary
codes that uses a geometric interpretation of the codebook. Our technique is
based on embedding the codebook in a Euclidean space of dimension equal to the
weight of the code. The encoder and decoder mappings are then interpreted as a
bijection between a certain hyper-rectangle and a polytope in this Euclidean
space. An inductive dissection algorithm is developed for constructing such a
bijection. We prove that the algorithm is correct and then analyze its
complexity. The complexity depends on the weight of the code, rather than on
the block length as in other algorithms. This approach is advantageous when the
weight is smaller than the square root of the block length.

What is the Mordell-Lang conjecture for subvarieties of the affine space A^g over a p-adic field?,"  We prove a dynamical version of the Mordell-Lang conjecture for subvarieties
of the affine space A^g over a p-adic field, endowed with polynomial actions on
each coordinate of A^g. We use analytic methods similar to the ones employed by
Skolem, Chabauty, and Coleman for studying diophantine equations.
"
What is the relationship between clonal fate data and the mechanisms of cell division and differentiation in the adult murine epidermis?,"  The rules governing cell division and differentiation are central to
understanding the mechanisms of development, aging and cancer. By utilising
inducible genetic labelling, recent studies have shown that the clonal
population in transgenic mouse epidermis can be tracked in vivo. Drawing on
these results, we explain how clonal fate data may be used to infer the rules
of cell division and differentiation underlying the maintenance of adult murine
tail-skin. We show that the rates of cell division and differentiation may be
evaluated by considering the long-time and short-time clone fate data, and that
the data is consistent with cells dividing independently rather than
synchronously. Motivated by these findings, we consider a mechanism for cancer
onset based closely on the model for normal adult skin. By analysing the
expected changes to clonal fate in cancer emerging from a simple two-stage
mutation, we propose that clonal fate data may provide a novel method for
studying the earliest stages of the disease.
"
What are the implications of the new uniqueness domains for parallel manipulators?,"  The aim of this paper is to characterize the uniqueness domains in the
workspace of parallel manipulators, as well as their image in the joint space.
The notion of aspect introduced for serial manipulators in [Borrel 86] is
redefined for such parallel manipulators. Then, it is shown that it is possible
to link several solutions to the direct kinematic problem without meeting a
singularity, thus meaning that the aspects are not uniqueness domains.
Additional surfaces are characterized in the workspace which yield new
uniqueness domains. An octree model of spaces is used to compute the joint
space, the workspace and all other newly defined sets. This study is
illustrated all along the paper with a 3-RPR planar parallel manipulator.
"
What is the main idea behind the integral representation of a function?,"  Integral transformations are used to estimate high order derivatives of
various special functions. Applications are given to numerical integration,
where estimates of high order derivatives of the integrand are needed to
achieve bounds on the error. The main idea is to find a suitable integral
representation of the function whose derivatives are to be estimated,
differentiate repeatedly under the integral sign, and estimate the resulting
integral.
"
What are the key concepts in the finite element space for elliptic problems?,"  A finite element method for elliptic problems with discontinuous coefficients
is presented. The discontinuity is assumed to take place along a closed smooth
curve. The proposed method allows to deal with meshes that are not adapted to
the discontinuity line. The (nonconforming) finite element space is enriched
with local basis functions. We prove an optimal convergence rate in the
$H^1$--norm. Numerical tests confirm the theoretical results.
"
What are the implications of the no-local-broadcasting theorem for multipartite quantum states?,"  We prove that the correlations present in a multipartite quantum state have
an \emph{operational} quantum character as soon as the state does not simply
encode a multipartite classical probability distribution, i.e. does not
describe the joint state of many classical registers. Even unentangled states
may exhibit such \emph{quantumness}, that is pointed out by the new task of
\emph{local broadcasting}, i.e. of locally sharing pre-established
correlations: this task is feasible if and only if correlations are classical
and derive a no-local-broadcasting theorem for quantum correlations. Thus,
local broadcasting is able to point out the quantumness of correlations, as
standard broadcasting points out the quantum character of single system states.
Further, we argue that our theorem implies the standard no-broadcasting theorem
for single systems, and that our operative approach leads in a natural way to
the definition of measures for quantumness of correlations.
"
What is the Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) observation of the supernova SN2004et?,"  We report on 8.4GHz Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) observations of
the type II-P supernova SN2004et in the spiral galaxy NGC 6946, made on 20
February 2005 (151 days after explosion). The Very Large Array (VLA) flux
density was 1.23$\pm$0.07 mJy, corresponding to an isotropic luminosity at
8.4GHz of (4.45$\pm$0.3)$\times10^{25}$ erg s$^{-1}$ Hz$^{-1}$ and a brightness
temperature of (1.3$\pm$0.3)$\times10^{8}$ K. We also provide an improved
source position, accurate to about 0.5 mas in each coordinate. The VLBI image
shows a clear asymmetry. From model fitting of the size of the radio emission,
we estimate a minimum expansion velocity of 15,700$\pm$2,000 km s$^{-1}$. This
velocity is more than twice the expected mean expansion velocity estimated from
a synchrotron self-absorbed emission model, thus suggesting that synchrotron
self-absorption is not relevant for this supernova. With the benefit of an
optical spectrum obtained 12 days after explosion, we favor an emission model
which consists of two hot spots on an underlying expanding shell of width
comparable to that of SN 1993J.
"
What is the list of publications of Dr. Kuznetsov?,"  The paper is dedicated to the memory of prominent theoretical physicist and
mathematician Dr. Vadim Kuznetsov who worked, in particular, in the fields of
the nonlinear dynamics, separation of variables, integrability theory, special
functions. It includes his short research biography, an account of the start of
his research career and the list of publications.
"
What are the spin wave modes observed in a ferromagnet with finite size?,"  I briefly review some of the results obtained using the CLEO-c detector
"
What is the relationship between the linear polarization variability and the H-alpha emission peak in Herbig AeBe stellar systems?,"  Recent spectropolarimetric observations of Herbig AeBe stellar systems show
linear polarization variability with wavelength and epoch near their obscured
H-alpha emission. Surprisingly, this polarization is not coincident with the
H-alpha emission peak but is variable near the absorptive part of the line
profile. With a new and novel model we show here that this is evidence of
optical pumping - anisotropy of the incident radiation that leads to a linear
polarization-dependent optical depth within the intervening hydrogen wind or
disk cloud. This effect can yield a larger polarization signal than scattering
polarization in these systems.
"
What are the implications of the emergence of dynamic heterogeneity in the silica system?,"  We implement a standard Monte Carlo algorithm to study the slow, equilibrium
dynamics of a silica melt in a wide temperature regime, from 6100 K down to
2750 K. We find that the average dynamical behaviour of the system is in
quantitative agreement with results obtained from molecular dynamics
simulations, at least in the long-time regime corresponding to the
alpha-relaxation. By contrast, the strong thermal vibrations related to the
Boson peak present at short times in molecular dynamics are efficiently
suppressed by the Monte Carlo algorithm. This allows us to reconsider silica
dynamics in the context of mode-coupling theory, because several shortcomings
of the theory were previously attributed to thermal vibrations. A mode-coupling
theory analysis of our data is qualitatively correct, but quantitative tests of
the theory fail, raising doubts about the very existence of an avoided
singularity in this system. We discuss the emergence of dynamic heterogeneity
and report detailed measurements of a decoupling between translational
diffusion and structural relaxation, and of a growing four-point dynamic
susceptibility. Dynamic heterogeneity appears to be less pronounced than in
more fragile glass-forming models, but not of a qualitatively different nature.
"
What are the relationships of 2-interval graphs to other graph classes?,"  The class of 2-interval graphs has been introduced for modelling scheduling
and allocation problems, and more recently for specific bioinformatic problems.
Some of those applications imply restrictions on the 2-interval graphs, and
justify the introduction of a hierarchy of subclasses of 2-interval graphs that
generalize line graphs: balanced 2-interval graphs, unit 2-interval graphs, and
(x,x)-interval graphs. We provide instances that show that all the inclusions
are strict. We extend the NP-completeness proof of recognizing 2-interval
graphs to the recognition of balanced 2-interval graphs. Finally we give hints
on the complexity of unit 2-interval graphs recognition, by studying
relationships with other graph classes: proper circular-arc, quasi-line graphs,
K_{1,5}-free graphs, ...
"
What is the fundamental quantum process underlying the intercharge force in quantum electrodynamics?,"  In quantum electrodynamics, the quantitatively most successful theory in the
history of science, intercharge forces obeying the inverse square law are due
to the exchange of space-like virtual photons. The fundamental quantum process
underlying applications as diverse as the gyromagnetic ratio of the electron
and electrical machinery is then M{\o}ller scattering $ee \to ee$. Analysis of
the quantum amplitude for this process shows that the corresponding intercharge
force acts instantaneously. This prediction has been verified in a recent
experiment.
"
What is the algorithm for evaluation of the power function of variables x and y given by the expression x^y?,"  We describe an algorithm for evaluation of the interval extension of the
power function of variables x and y given by the expression x^y. Our algorithm
reduces the general case to the case of non-negative bases.
"
What are the signatures of electron-electron correlation in STS images of semiconductor quantum dots?,"  We show both theoretically and experimentally that scanning tunneling
spectroscopy (STS) images of semiconductor quantum dots may display clear
signatures of electron-electron correlation. We apply many-body tunneling
theory to a realistic model which fully takes into account correlation effects
and dot anisotropy. Comparing measured STS images of freestanding InAs quantum
dots with those calculated by the full configuration interaction method, we
explain the wave function sequence in terms of images of one- and two-electron
states. The STS map corresponding to double charging is significantly distorted
by electron correlation with respect to the non-interacting case.
"
What is the relation between the Belief Propagation algorithm and Expectation Propagation algorithms?,"  In this paper we derive the equations for Loop Corrected Belief Propagation
on a continuous variable Gaussian model. Using the exactness of the averages
for belief propagation for Gaussian models, a different way of obtaining the
covariances is found, based on Belief Propagation on cavity graphs. We discuss
the relation of this loop correction algorithm to Expectation Propagation
algorithms for the case in which the model is no longer Gaussian, but slightly
perturbed by nonlinear terms.
"
What is the method used to solve the problem of finding a gauge parameter for a marginal deformation in open superstring field theory?,"  We construct analytic solutions for marginal deformations satisfying the
reality condition in open superstring field theory formulated by Berkovits when
operator products made of the marginal operator and the associated
superconformal primary field are regular. Our strategy is based on the recent
observation by Erler that the problem of finding solutions for marginal
deformations in open superstring field theory can be reduced to a problem in
the bosonic theory of finding a finite gauge parameter for a certain pure-gauge
configuration labeled by the parameter of the marginal deformation. We find a
gauge transformation generated by a real gauge parameter which infinitesimally
changes the deformation parameter and construct a finite gauge parameter by its
path-ordered exponential. The resulting solution satisfies the reality
condition by construction.
"
What is the Bianchi type I massive string cosmological model with magnetic field of barotropic perfect fluid distribution?,"  Bianchi type I massive string cosmological model with magnetic field of
barotropic perfect fluid distribution through the techniques used by Latelier
and Stachel, is investigated. To get the deterministic model of the universe,
it is assumed that the universe is filled with barotropic perfect fluid
distribution. The magnetic field is due to electric current produced along
x-axis with infinite electrical conductivity. The behaviour of the model in
presence and absence of magnetic field together with other physical aspects is
further discussed.
"
What are the rotational velocities of the two late-M objects B and C?,"  We show individual high resolution spectra of components A, B, and C of the
nearby late-M type multiple system LHS 1070. Component A is a mid-M star, B and
C are known to have masses at the threshold to brown dwarfs. From our spectra
we measure rotation velocities and the mean magnetic field for all three
components individually. We find magnetic flux on the order of several
kilo-Gauss in all components. The rotation velocities of the two late-M objects
B and C are similar (vsini = 16km/s), the earlier A component is spinning only
at about half that rate. This suggests weakening of net rotational braking at
late-M spectral type, and that the lack of slowly rotating late-M and L dwarfs
is real. Furthermore, we found that magnetic flux in the B component is about
twice as strong as in component C at similar rotation rate. This indicates that
rotational braking is not proportional to magnetic field strength in fully
convective objects, and that a different field topology is the reason for the
weak braking in low mass objects.
"
What are the phase diagram of the system in special cases?,"  We introduce an exactly-solvable family of one-dimensional driven-diffusive
systems defined on a discrete lattice. We find the quadratic algebra of this
family which has an infinite-dimensional representation. We discuss the phase
diagram of the system in a couple of special cases.
"
What are the formulas in the classical table of integrals of the family?,"  We present the evaluation of a family of logarithmic integrals. This provides
a unified proof of several formulas in the classical table of integrals by I.
S. Gradshteyn and I. M. Rhyzik.
"
What is the origin of the indeterminacy of angular orientation of particle trajectories?,"  A new kind of quantum indeterminacy of transverse position is shown to arise
from quantum degrees of freedom of spacetime, based on the assumption that
classical trajectories can be defined no better than the diffraction limit of
Planck scale waves. Indeterminacy of the angular orientation of particle
trajectories due to wave/particle duality at the Planck scale leads to
indeterminacy of a nearly-flat spacetime metric, described as a small
nonvanishing quantum commutation relation between transverse position operators
at different events along a null trajectory. An independent derivation of the
same effect is presented based on the requirement of unitarity in black hole
evaporation. The indeterminacy is interpreted as a universal holographic
quantum spacetime noise, with a frequency-independent spectrum of metric
perturbation amplitude, h_H^2^{1/2} \simeq \sqrt{l_P}=2.3 \times 10^{-22}
/\sqrt{Hz}, where l_P denotes the Planck length. The effect is estimated to be
directly measurable using current interferometer technology similar to LIGO and
LISA.
"
How can a rational point be constructed on the curves $C_{i}$ using the results of \cite{Woe}?,"  Let $K$ be a field, $a, b\in K$ and $ab\neq 0$. Let us consider the
polynomials $g_{1}(x)=x^n+ax+b, g_{2}(x)=x^n+ax^2+bx$, where $n$ is a fixed
positive integer. In this paper we show that for each $k\geq 2$ the
hypersurface given by the equation \begin{equation*} S_{k}^{i}:
u^2=\prod_{j=1}^{k}g_{i}(x_{j}),\quad i=1, 2. \end{equation*} contains a
rational curve. Using the above and Woestijne's recent results \cite{Woe} we
show how one can construct a rational point different from the point at
infinity on the curves $C_{i}:y^2=g_{i}(x), (i=1, 2)$ defined over a finite
field, in polynomial time.
"
"What is the significance of the metal abundance, kinematics, and position of NGC 1883 in the context of the Galactic disk radial abundance gradient?","  Having already reported on the first photometric study of the
intermediate-age open cluster NGC 1883 (Carraro et al. 2003), we present in
this paper the first spectroscopic multi-epoch investigation of a sample of
evolved stars in the same cluster. The aim is to derive the cluster membership,
velocity and metallicity, and discuss recent claims in the literature (Tadross
2005) that NGC 1883 is as metal poor as globular clusters in the Halo. Besides,
being one of the few outer Galactic disk intermediate-age open clusters known
so far, it is an ideal target to improve our knowledge of the Galactic disk
radial abundance gradient, that is a basic ingredient for any chemical
evolution model of the Milky Way. The new data we obtained allow us to put NGC
1883's basic parameters more reliable. We find that the cluster has a mean
metallicity of [Fe/H] = -0.20$\pm$0.22, from which we infer an age
(650$^{+70}_{-70}$ Myr) close to the Hyades one and a Galactocentric distance
of 12.3$^{+0.4}_{-0.2}$ kpc. The metal abundance, kinematics, and position make
NGC 1883 a genuine outer disk intermediate-age open cluster. We confirm that in
the outer Galactic disk the abundance gradient is shallower than in the solar
vicinity.
"
What are the advantages of the Maxima of Cumulant Function (MCF) over other techniques for analyzing spatial patterns?,"  The spatial coherence of a measured variable (e.g. temperature or pressure)
is often studied to determine the regions where this variable varies the most
or to find teleconnections, i.e. correlations between specific regions. While
usual methods to find spatial patterns, such as Principal Components Analysis
(PCA), are constrained by linear symmetries, the dependence of variables such
as temperature or pressure at different locations is generally nonlinear. In
particular, large deviations from the sample mean are expected to be strongly
affected by such nonlinearities. Here we apply a newly developed nonlinear
technique (Maxima of Cumulant Function, MCF) for the detection of typical
spatial patterns that largely deviate from the mean. In order to test the
technique and to introduce the methodology, we focus on the El Nino/Southern
Oscillation and its spatial patterns. We find nonsymmetric temperature patterns
corresponding to El Nino and La Nina, and we compare the results of MCF with
other techniques, such as the symmetric solutions of PCA, and the nonsymmetric
solutions of Nonlinear PCA (NLPCA). We found that MCF solutions are more
reliable than the NLPCA fits, and can capture mixtures of principal components.
Finally, we apply Extreme Value Theory on the temporal variations extracted
from our methodology. We find that the tails of the distribution of extreme
temperatures during La Nina episodes is bounded, while the tail during El Ninos
is less likely to be bounded. This implies that the mean spatial patterns of
the two phases are asymmetric, as well as the behaviour of their extremes.
"
What are the optical characteristics of the components of photonic crystals?,"  Structured materials like photonic crystals require for optimal use a high
precision both on position and optical characteristics of the components which
they are made of. Here, we present a simple tomographic algorithm, based on a
specific Green's function together with a first-order Born approximation, which
enables us to localize and characterize identical defects in finite-size
photonic crystals. This algorithm is proposed as a first step to the monitoring
of such materials. Illustrative numerical results show in particular some
possibility of focalization beyond the Rayleigh criterion.
"
What are the soft and collinear effects in the QCD form factor?,"  We compute the QCD form factor resumming threshold logarithms in B --> X_c +
l + nu_l decays to next-to-leading logarithmic approximation. We present an
interpolation formula including soft as well as collinear effects softened by
the non-vanishing charm mass.
"
What are the distinct spin wave modes observed in a ferromagnet with finite size?,"  We show that full-image micro-PIV analysis in combination with images of
transient particle motion is a powerful tool for experimental studies of
acoustic radiation forces and acoustic streaming in microfluidic chambers under
piezo-actuation in the MHz range. The measured steady-state motion of both
large 5 um and small 1 um particles can be understood in terms of the acoustic
eigenmodes or standing ultra-sound waves in the given experimental
microsystems. This interpretation is supported by numerical solutions of the
corresponding acoustic wave equation.
"
What are the Maximum-Likelihood and Bayesian methods used to update finite element models of a beam and an unsymmetrical H-shaped structure?,"  This paper compares the Maximum-likelihood method and Bayesian method for
finite element model updating. The Maximum-likelihood method was implemented
using genetic algorithm while the Bayesian method was implemented using the
Markov Chain Monte Carlo. These methods were tested on a simple beam and an
unsymmetrical H-shaped structure. The results show that the Bayesian method
gave updated finite element models that predicted more accurate modal
properties than the updated finite element models obtained through the use of
the Maximum-likelihood method. Furthermore, both these methods were found to
require the same levels of computational loads.
"
What is the relationship between the real part of the time separation at spatial infinity and the total energy of the relic radiation?,"  We present a non-string-theoretic calculation of the microcanonical entropy
of relic integer-spin Hawking radiation -- at fixed total energy $E$. The only
conserved macroscopic quantity is the total energy $E$ (the total energy of the
relic radiation). Data for a boundary-value approach, with massless,
integer-spin perturbations, are set on initial and final space-like
hypersurfaces. In the resulting 1-dimensional statistical-mechanics problem,
the real part of the (complex) time separation at spatial infinity, $T =
{\mid}T{\mid}\exp(-i\delta), \delta >0$, is the variable conjugate to the total
energy. We count the number of weak-field configurations on the final
space-like hypersurface with energy $E$. One recovers the Cardy formula and the
Bekenstein-Hawking entropy, if Re(T) is of the order of the black-hole life-
time, leading to a statistical interpretation of black-hole entropy. The
microcanonical entropy includes a logarithmic correction to the black-hole area
law, which is {\it universal} (independent of black-hole parameters). Here, the
discreteness of the energy levels is crucial. This approach is compared with
that of string theory for the transition to the fundamental-string r\'egime in
the final stages of evaporation. The squared coupling, $g^2$, regulating the
transition to a highly-excited string state and {\it vice versa}, can be
related to the angle, $\delta$, of complex-time rotation above. The
strong-coupling r\'egime corresponds to a Euclidean black hole, while the
physical limit of a Lorentzian space-time (as $ \delta \to 0_+$) corresponds to
the weak-coupling r\'egime. This resembles the transition to a highly-excited
string-like state which subsequently decays into massless particles, thereby
avoiding the naked singularity.
"
What are the methods of estimation of suitable reliability metrics for accelerated test (AT) experiments?,"  Engineers in the manufacturing industries have used accelerated test (AT)
experiments for many decades. The purpose of AT experiments is to acquire
reliability information quickly. Test units of a material, component, subsystem
or entire systems are subjected to higher-than-usual levels of one or more
accelerating variables such as temperature or stress. Then the AT results are
used to predict life of the units at use conditions. The extrapolation is
typically justified (correctly or incorrectly) on the basis of physically
motivated models or a combination of empirical model fitting with a sufficient
amount of previous experience in testing similar units. The need to extrapolate
in both time and the accelerating variables generally necessitates the use of
fully parametric models. Statisticians have made important contributions in the
development of appropriate stochastic models for AT data [typically a
distribution for the response and regression relationships between the
parameters of this distribution and the accelerating variable(s)], statistical
methods for AT planning (choice of accelerating variable levels and allocation
of available test units to those levels) and methods of estimation of suitable
reliability metrics. This paper provides a review of many of the AT models that
have been used successfully in this area.
"
What is the novel method used to solve the self-consistent equations for order parameters in oscillator networks?,"  In many real-world oscillator systems, the phase response curves are highly
heterogeneous. However, dynamics of heterogeneous oscillator networks has not
been seriously addressed. We propose a theoretical framework to analyze such a
system by dealing explicitly with the heterogeneous phase response curves. We
develop a novel method to solve the self-consistent equations for order
parameters by using formal complex-valued phase variables, and apply our theory
to networks of in vitro cortical neurons. We find a novel state transition that
is not observed in previous oscillator network models.
"
What is the theory of the motion of binary black holes?,"  Some of the theoretical challenges posed by the general relativistic
description of binary systems of compact objects (neutron stars or black holes)
are reviewed. We recall the various ways one can use the theory of the motion,
and of the timing, of binary pulsars to test the strong-field and/or radiative
aspects of General Relativity. Recent advances in the theory of the motion and
radiation of binary black holes are discussed. One emphasizes the usefulness of
the Effective One Body approach in providing a quasi-analytical description of
the waveform emitted by coalescing binary black holes.
"
What are the technical details of the fabrication process of a homemade analog electronics board?,"  A set of analog electronics boards for serial readout of silicon strip
sensors was fabricated. A commercially available amplifier is mounted on a
homemade hybrid board in order to receive analog signals from silicon strip
sensors. Also, another homemade circuit board is fabricated in order to
translate amplifier control signals into a suitable format and to provide bias
voltage to the amplifier as well as to the silicon sensors. We discuss
technical details of the fabrication process and performance of the circuit
boards we developed.
"
What is the role of a high-statistics sample of muon neutrino CCQE events in the MiniBooNE experiment?,"  The observation of neutrino oscillations is clear evidence for physics beyond
the standard model. To make precise measurements of this phenomenon, neutrino
oscillation experiments, including MiniBooNE, require an accurate description
of neutrino charged current quasi-elastic (CCQE) cross sections to predict
signal samples. Using a high-statistics sample of muon neutrino CCQE events,
MiniBooNE finds that a simple Fermi gas model, with appropriate adjustments,
accurately characterizes the CCQE events observed in a carbon-based detector.
The extracted parameters include an effective axial mass, M_A^eff = 1.23+/-0.20
GeV, that describes the four-momentum dependence of the axial-vector form
factor of the nucleon; and a Pauli-suppression parameter, kappa =
1.019+/-0.011. Such a modified Fermi gas model may also be used by future
accelerator-based experiments measuring neutrino oscillations on nuclear
targets.
"
"What are the geometrical and electronic structures of a 4 {\AA} diameter perfect and deformed 5,3 single-walled gold nanotube (SWGT)?","  The geometrical and electronic structures of the 4 {\AA} diameter perfect and
deformed (5, 3) single-walled gold nanotube (SWGT) have been studied based upon
the density-functional theory in the local-density approximation (LDA). The
calculated relaxed geometries show clearly significant deviations from those of
the ideally rolled triangular gold sheet. It is found that the different
strains have different effects on the electronic structures and density of
states of the SWGTs. And the small shear strain can reduce the binding energy
per gold atom of the deformed SWGT, which is consistent with the experimentally
observed result. Finally, we found the finite SWGT can show the
metal-semiconductor transition.
"
What is the deformation parameter in the SU(N) SYM theory?,"  This is a sequel of our paper hep-th/0606125 in which we have studied the
{\cal N}=1 SU(N) SYM theory obtained as a marginal deformation of the {\cal
N}=4 theory, with a complex deformation parameter \beta and in the planar
limit. There we have addressed the issue of conformal invariance imposing the
theory to be finite and we have found that finiteness requires reality of the
deformation parameter \beta. In this paper we relax the finiteness request and
look for a theory that in the planar limit has vanishing beta functions. We
perform explicit calculations up to five loop order: we find that the
conditions of beta function vanishing can be achieved with a complex
deformation parameter, but the theory is not finite and the result depends on
the arbitrary choice of the subtraction procedure. Therefore, while the
finiteness condition leads to a scheme independent result, so that the
conformal invariant theory with a real deformation is physically well defined,
the condition of vanishing beta function leads to a result which is scheme
dependent and therefore of unclear significance. In order to show that these
findings are not an artefact of dimensional regularization, we confirm our
results within the differential renormalization approach.
"
What is the discrete analogue of differential forms defined on simplicial complexes?,"  A discrete (finite-difference) analogue of differential forms is considered,
defined on simplicial complexes, including triangulations of continuous
manifolds. Various operations are explicitly defined on these forms, including
exterior derivative and exterior product. The latter one is non-associative.
Instead, as anticipated, it is a part of non-trivial A-infinity structure,
involving a chain of poly-linear operations, constrained by nilpotency
relation: (d + \wedge + m + ...)^n = 0 with n=2.
"
What are the three phases in the quantum phase diagram of the one-dimensional Hubbard model?,"  We determine the quantum phase diagram of the one-dimensional Hubbard model
with bond-charge interaction X in addition to the usual Coulomb repulsion U at
half-filling. For large enough X and positive U the model shows three phases.
For large U the system is in the spin-density wave phase already known in the
usual Hubbard model. As U decreases, there is first a spin transition to a
spontaneously dimerized bond-ordered wave phase and then a charge transition to
a novel phase in which the dominant correlations at large distances correspond
to an incommensurate singlet superconductor.
"
What is the lower and upper bounds of the planar front speed propagation in a superconductor?,"  We study the interface propagation in superconductors by means of a
variational method. We compute the lower and upper bounds for which the planar
front speed propagation is valid. To take into account delay or memory effects
in the front propagation, an hyperbolic differential equation is introduced as
an extension of the model.
"
What are the initial transiting candidates for the detection of exoplanets?,"  We have performed photometric observations of nearly 7 million stars with 8 <
V < 15 with the SuperWASP-North instrument from La Palma between 2004
May-September. Fields in the RA range 17-18hr, yielding over 185,000 stars with
sufficient quality data, have been searched for transits using a modified box
least-squares (BLS) algorithm. We find a total of 58 initial transiting
candidates which have high S/N in the BLS, show multiple transit-like dips and
have passed visual inspection. Analysis of the blending and inferred planetary
radii for these candidates leaves a total of 7 transiting planet candidates
which pass all the tests plus 4 which pass the majority. We discuss the derived
parameters for these candidates and their properties and comment on the
implications for future transit searches.
"
What are the logics that enjoy a shallow model property and a unified derivation of PSPACE-bounds?,"  For lack of general algorithmic methods that apply to wide classes of logics,
establishing a complexity bound for a given modal logic is often a laborious
task. The present work is a step towards a general theory of the complexity of
modal logics. Our main result is that all rank-1 logics enjoy a shallow model
property and thus are, under mild assumptions on the format of their
axiomatisation, in PSPACE. This leads to a unified derivation of tight
PSPACE-bounds for a number of logics including K, KD, coalition logic, graded
modal logic, majority logic, and probabilistic modal logic. Our generic
algorithm moreover finds tableau proofs that witness pleasant proof-theoretic
properties including a weak subformula property. This generality is made
possible by a coalgebraic semantics, which conveniently abstracts from the
details of a given model class and thus allows covering a broad range of logics
in a uniform way.
"
What is the fine tuning problem of supersymmetric models?,"  The solution of a fine tuning problem is one of the principal motivations of
Supersymmetry. However experimental constraints indicate that many
Supersymmetric models are also fine tuned (although to a much lesser extent).
We review the traditional measure of this fine tuning used in the literature
and propose an alternative. We apply this to the MSSM and show the
implications.
"
What are the quantum effects of interference and superposition of the quantum model?,"  We extend a quantum model in Hilbert space developed in Aerts (2007a) into a
quantum field theoric model in Fock space for the modeling of the combination
of concepts. Items and concepts are represented by vectors in Fock space and
membership weights of items are modeled by quantum probabilities. We apply this
theory to model the disjunction of concepts and show that the predictions of
our theory for the membership weights of items regarding the disjunction of
concepts match with great accuracy the complete set of results of an experiment
conducted by Hampton (1988b). It are the quantum effects of interference and
superposition of that are at the origin of the effects of overextension and
underextension observed by Hampton as deviations from a classical use of the
disjunction. It is essential for the perfect matches we obtain between the
predictions of the quantum field model and Hampton's experimental data that
items can be in superpositions of `different numbers states' which proves that
the genuine structure of quantum field theory is needed to match predictions
with experimental data.

"What are the Yukawa potentials used to describe systems such as colloids, plasmas, etc.?","  Yukawa potentials are often used as effective potentials for systems as
colloids, plasmas, etc. When the Debye screening length is large, the Yukawa
potential tends to the non-screened Coulomb potential ; in this small screening
limit, or Coulomb limit, the potential is long ranged. As it is well known in
computer simulation, a simple truncation of the long ranged potential and the
minimum image convention are insufficient to obtain accurate numerical data on
systems. The Ewald method for bulk systems, i.e. with periodic boundary
conditions in all three directions of the space, has already been derived for
Yukawa potential [cf. Y., Rosenfeld, {\it Mol. Phys.}, \bm{88}, 1357, (1996)
and G., Salin and J.-M., Caillol, {\it J. Chem. Phys.}, \bm{113}, 10459,
(2000)], but for systems with partial periodic boundary conditions, the Ewald
sums have only recently been obtained [M., Mazars, {\it J. Chem. Phys.}, {\bf
126}, 056101 (2007)]. In this paper, we provide a closed derivation of the
Ewald sums for Yukawa potentials in systems with periodic boundary conditions
in only two directions and for any value of the Debye length. A special
attention is paid to the Coulomb limit and its relation with the
electroneutrality of systems.
"
What is the age of the star-forming regions in the galaxy Mrk 35 (Haro 3)?,"  We present results from a detailed spectrophotometric analysis of the blue
compact dwarf galaxy Mrk 35 (Haro 3), based on deep optical (B,V,R,I) and
near-IR (J,H,K) imaging, Halpha narrow-band observations and long-slit
spectroscopy. The optical emission of the galaxy is dominated by a central
young starburst, with a bar-like shape, while an underlying component of stars,
with elliptical isophotes and red colors, extends more than 4 kpc from the
galaxy center. High resolution Halpha and color maps allow us to identify the
star-forming regions, to spatially discriminate them from the older stars, and
to recognize several dust patches. We derive colors and Halpha parameters for
all the identified star-forming knots. Observables derived for each knot are
corrected for the contribution of the underlying older stellar population, the
contribution by emission lines, and from interstellar extinction, and compared
with evolutionary synthesis models. We find that the contributions of these
three factors are by no means negligible and that they significantly vary
across the galaxy. Therefore, careful quantification and subtraction of
emission lines, galaxy host contribution, and interstellar reddening at every
galaxy position, are essential to derive the properties of the young stars in
BCDs. We find that we can reproduce the colors of all the knots with an
instantaneous burst of star formation and the Salpeter initial mass function
with an upper mass limit of 100 M_solar. In all cases the knots are just a few
Myr old. The underlying population of stars has colors consistent with being
several Gyr old.
"
What are the implications of the k-fold exponential time complexity for the model checking problem of HFL?,"  Higher-Order Fixpoint Logic (HFL) is a hybrid of the simply typed
\lambda-calculus and the modal \lambda-calculus. This makes it a highly
expressive temporal logic that is capable of expressing various interesting
correctness properties of programs that are not expressible in the modal
\lambda-calculus.
  This paper provides complexity results for its model checking problem. In
particular we consider those fragments of HFL built by using only types of
bounded order k and arity m. We establish k-fold exponential time completeness
for model checking each such fragment. For the upper bound we use fixpoint
elimination to obtain reachability games that are singly-exponential in the
size of the formula and k-fold exponential in the size of the underlying
transition system. These games can be solved in deterministic linear time. As a
simple consequence, we obtain an exponential time upper bound on the expression
complexity of each such fragment.
  The lower bound is established by a reduction from the word problem for
alternating (k-1)-fold exponential space bounded Turing Machines. Since there
are fixed machines of that type whose word problems are already hard with
respect to k-fold exponential time, we obtain, as a corollary, k-fold
exponential time completeness for the data complexity of our fragments of HFL,
provided m exceeds 3. This also yields a hierarchy result in expressive power.
"
What are the key concepts in a combinatorial identity of a sphere with multiple holes?,"  We enumerate rooted triangulations of a sphere with multiple holes by the
total number of edges and the length of each boundary component. The proof
relies on a combinatorial identity due to W.T. Tutte.
"
What are the properties of the degeneracy pattern or of tRNA aminoacylation specificity exchanged?,"  This letter reports complete sets of two-fold symmetries between partitions
of the universal genetic code. By substituting bases at each position of the
codons according to a fixed rule, it happens that properties of the degeneracy
pattern or of tRNA aminoacylation specificity are exchanged.
"
What is the geometric interpretation of the compactified Jacobian of a nodal curve?,"  We study the theta divisor of the compactified jacobian of a nodal, possibly
reducible, curve. We compute its irreducible components and give it a geometric
interpretation consistent with the classical Brill-Noether theory of smooth
curves. Some applications on hyperelliptic stable curves are appended.
"
What are the exact relations for moments for these cases?,"  Recently a new type of Kramers-Fokker-Planck Equation has been proposed [R.
Friedrich et al. Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 96}, 230601 (2006)] describing anomalous
diffusion in external potentials. In the present paper the explicit cases of a
harmonic potential and a velocity-dependend damping are incorporated. Exact
relations for moments for these cases are presented and the asymptotic
behaviour for long times is discussed. Interestingly the bounding potential and
the additional damping by itself lead to a subdiffussive behaviour, while
acting together the particle becomes localized for long times.
"
What is the correlation function of height fluctuations dependent on temperature?,"  We present both numerical and analytical study of graphene roughness with a
crystal structure including $500 \times 500$ atoms. The roughness can
effectively result in a random gauge field and has important consequences for
its electronic structure. Our results show that its height fluctuations in
small scales have scaling behavior with a temperature dependent roughness
exponent in the interval of $ 0.6 < \chi < 0.7 $. The correlation function of
height fluctuations depends upon temperature with characteristic length scale
of $ \approx 90 {\AA}$ (at room temperature). We show that the correlation
function of the induced gauge field has a short-range nature with correlation
length of about $\simeq 2-3 {\AA}$. We also treat the problem analytically by
using the Martin-Siggia-Rose method. The renormalization group flows did not
yield any delocalized-localized transition arising from the graphene roughness.
Our results are in good agreement with recent experimental observations.
"
What are the general conditions on the weight of a Beurling algebra that allows the vanishing of continuous derivations?,"  Let $L^1_\om(G)$ be a Beurling algebra on a locally compact abelian group
$G$. We look for general conditions on the weight which allows the vanishing of
continuous derivations of $L^1_\om(G)$. This leads us to introducing
vector-valued Beurling algebras and considering the translation of operators on
them. This is then used to connect the augmentation ideal to the behavior of
derivation space. We apply these results to give examples of various classes of
Beurling algebras which are weakly amenable, 2-weakly amenable or fail to be
even 2-weakly amenable.
"
What is the combinatorial description of the Kazhdan-Lusztig basis elements?,"  We provide a non-recursive description for the bounded admissible sets of
masks used by Deodhar's algorithm to calculate the Kazhdan--Lusztig polynomials
$P_{x,w}(q)$ of type $A$, in the case when $w$ is hexagon avoiding and
maximally clustered. This yields a combinatorial description of the
Kazhdan--Lusztig basis elements of the Hecke algebra associated to such
permutations $w$. The maximally-clustered hexagon-avoiding elements are
characterized by avoiding the seven classical permutation patterns $\{3421,
4312, 4321, 46718235, 46781235, 56718234, 56781234\}$. We also briefly discuss
the application of heaps to permutation pattern characterization.
"
What is the traditional approach to cluster matching by permuting cluster labels?,"  Cluster matching by permuting cluster labels is important in many clustering
contexts such as cluster validation and cluster ensemble techniques. The
classic approach is to minimize the euclidean distance between two cluster
solutions which induces inappropriate stability in certain settings. Therefore,
we present the truematch algorithm that introduces two improvements best
explained in the crisp case. First, instead of maximizing the trace of the
cluster crosstable, we propose to maximize a chi-square transformation of this
crosstable. Thus, the trace will not be dominated by the cells with the largest
counts but by the cells with the most non-random observations, taking into
account the marginals. Second, we suggest a probabilistic component in order to
break ties and to make the matching algorithm truly random on random data. The
truematch algorithm is designed as a building block of the truecluster
framework and scales in polynomial time. First simulation results confirm that
the truematch algorithm gives more consistent truecluster results for unequal
cluster sizes. Free R software is available.
"
What are the implications of a complete graph for graph embeddings?,"  We construct a graph G such that any embedding of G into R^{3} contains a
nonsplit link of two components, where at least one of the components is a
nontrivial knot. Further, for any m < n we produce a graph H so that every
embedding of H contains a nonsplit n component link, where at least m of the
components are nontrivial knots.
  We then turn our attention to complete graphs and show that for any given n,
every embedding of a large enough complete graph contains a two component link
whose linking number is a nonzero multiple of n.
"
What are the spatial indexing techniques used to assist in the spatial indexing of data?,"  This paper presents a hybrid approach to spatial indexing of two dimensional
data. It sheds new light on the age old problem by thinking of the traditional
algorithms as working with images. Inspiration is drawn from an analogous
situation that is found in machine and human vision. Image processing
techniques are used to assist in the spatial indexing of the data. A fixed grid
approach is used and bins with too many records are sub-divided hierarchically.
Search queries are pre-computed for bins that do not contain any data records.
This has the effect of dividing the search space up into non rectangular
regions which are based on the spatial properties of the data. The bucketing
quad tree can be considered as an image with a resolution of two by two for
each layer. The results show that this method performs better than the quad
tree if there are more divisions per layer. This confirms our suspicions that
the algorithm works better if it gets to look at the data with higher
resolution images. An elegant class structure is developed where the
implementation of concrete spatial indexes for a particular data type merely
relies on rendering the data onto an image.
"
What are the three phases in a triangulated fluid surface model?,"  We find three distinct phases; a tubular phase, a planar phase, and the
spherical phase, in a triangulated fluid surface model. It is also found that
these phases are separated by discontinuous transitions. The fluid surface
model is investigated within the framework of the conventional curvature model
by using the canonical Monte Carlo simulations with dynamical triangulations.
The mechanical strength of the surface is given only by skeletons, and no
two-dimensional bending energy is assumed in the Hamiltonian. The skeletons are
composed of elastic linear-chains and rigid junctions and form a
compartmentalized structure on the surface, and for this reason the vertices of
triangles can diffuse freely only inside the compartments. As a consequence, an
inhomogeneous structure is introduced in the model; the surface strength inside
the compartments is different from the surface strength on the compartments.
However, the rotational symmetry is not influenced by the elastic skeletons;
there is no specific direction on the surface. In addition to the three phases
mentioned above, a collapsed phase is expected to exist in the low bending
rigidity regime that was not studied here. The inhomogeneous structure and the
fluidity of vertices are considered to be the origin of such variety of phases.
"
What is the relationship between the eccentricity and the initial separation in the inspiral?,"  Standard choices of quasi-circular orbit parameters for black-hole binary
evolutions result in eccentric inspiral. We introduce a conceptually simple
method, which is to integrate the post-Newtonian equations of motion through
hundreds of orbits, and read off the values of the momenta at the separation at
which we wish to start a fully general relativistic numerical evolution. For
the particular case of non-spinning equal-mass inspiral with an initial
coordinate separation of $D = 11M$ we show that this approach reduces the
eccentricity by at least a factor of five to $e < 0.002$ as compared to using
standard quasi-circular initial parameters.
"
"What are the basic mechanisms of systematic variation of collision energy, system sizes, and orientations?","  Using a combined quantum mechanical/classical method, we study the collisions
of small Na clusters on large Ar clusters as a model for cluster deposit. We
work out basic mechanisms by systematic variation of collision energy, system
sizes, and orientations. The soft Ar material is found to serve as an extremely
efficient shock absorber. The collisional energy is quickly transfered at first
impact and the Na clusters are always captured by the Ar surface. The
distribution of the collision energy into the Ar system proceeds very fast with
velocity of sound. The relaxation of shapes goes at a slower pace using times
of several ps. It produces a substantial rearrangement of the Ar system while
the Na cluster remains rather robust.
"
What is the multipolar analysis of the gravitational recoil computed in numerical simulations of black hole coalescence?,"  We present a multipolar analysis of the gravitational recoil computed in
recent numerical simulations of binary black hole (BH) coalescence, for both
unequal masses and non-zero, non-precessing spins. We show that multipole
moments up to and including l=4 are sufficient to accurately reproduce the
final recoil velocity (within ~2%) and that only a few dominant modes
contribute significantly to it (within ~5%). We describe how the relative
amplitudes, and more importantly, the relative phases, of these few modes
control the way in which the recoil builds up throughout the inspiral, merger,
and ringdown phases. We also find that the numerical results can be reproduced
by an ``effective Newtonian'' formula for the multipole moments obtained by
replacing the radial separation in the Newtonian formulae with an effective
radius computed from the numerical data. Beyond the merger, the numerical
results are reproduced by a superposition of three Kerr quasi-normal modes
(QNMs). Analytic formulae, obtained by expressing the multipole moments in
terms of the fundamental QNMs of a Kerr BH, are able to explain the onset and
amount of ``anti-kick'' for each of the simulations. Lastly, we apply this
multipolar analysis to help explain the remarkable difference between the
amplitudes of planar and non-planar kicks for equal-mass spinning black holes.
"
What does the evolution of the pair fraction imply for the process of galaxy evolution?,"  We measure the fraction of luminous galaxies in pairs at projected
separations of 5-20 kpc out to z=1.2 in the COSMOS field using ACS images and
photometric redshifts derived from an extensive multiwavelength dataset.
Analysis of a complete sample of 106,188 galaxies more luminous than M_V=-19.8
(~ L_V*) in the redshift range 0.1 < z < 1.2 yields 1,749 galaxy pairs. These
data are supplemented by a local z=0-0.1 value for the galaxy pair fraction
derived from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). After statistically
correcting the COSMOS pair sample for chance line-of-sight superpositions, the
evolution in the pair fraction is fit by a power law \propto (1+z)^{n=3.1 \pm
0.1}. If this strongly evolving pair fraction continues out to higher redshift,
~ 50% of all luminous galaxies at z ~ 2 are in close pairs. This clearly
signifies that galaxy mergers are a very significant and possibly dominant
mechanism for galaxy evolution during the epoch of galaxy formation at z=1 to
3.
"
How can a periodic perturbation lead to the capture into resonance?,"  We investigate a system of two weakly coupled oscillators. It is shown that
an external periodic perturbation can lead to the capture into resonance.
Asymptotic description and numerical simulations are presented. We have
obtained the explicit formula for the threshold value for the amplitude of the
perturbation that leads to the autoresonance.
"
What is the conditional probability (propagator) used to determine the properties of a network?,"  The properties of certain networks are determined by hidden variables that
are not explicitly measured. The conditional probability (propagator) that a
vertex with a given value of the hidden variable is connected to k of other
vertices determines all measurable properties. We study hidden variable models
and find an averaging approximation that enables us to obtain a general
analytical result for the propagator. Analytic results showing the validity of
the approximation are obtained. We apply hidden variable models to
protein-protein interaction networks (PINs) in which the hidden variable is the
association free-energy, determined by distributions that depend on
biochemistry and evolution. We compute degree distributions as well as
clustering coefficients of several PINs of different species; good agreement
with measured data is obtained. For the human interactome two different
parameter sets give the same degree distributions, but the computed clustering
coefficients differ by a factor of about two. This shows that degree
distributions are not sufficient to determine the properties of PINs.
"
What are the implications of the entropic index in correlated subsystems for the case of Tsallis entropy?,"  We use Beck's quasi-additivity of Tsallis entropies for $n$ independent
subsystems to show that like the case of $n=2$, the entropic index $q$
approaches 1 by increasing system size. Then, we will generalize that concept
to correlated subsystems to find that in the case of correlated subsystems,
when system size increases, $q$ also approaches a value corresponding to the
additive case.
"
What is the minimal coupling defined in the gauge theory?,"  Yes, there is. - A new kind of gauge theory is introduced, where the minimal
coupling and corresponding covariant derivatives are defined in the space of
functions pertaining to the functional Schroedinger picture of a given field
theory. While, for simplicity, we study the example of an U(1) symmetry, this
kind of gauge theory can accommodate other symmetries as well. We consider the
resulting relativistic nonlinear extension of quantum mechanics and show that
it incorporates gravity in the (0+1)-dimensional limit, where it leads to the
Schroedinger-Newton equations. Gravity is encoded here into a universal
nonlinear extension of quantum theory. The probabilistic interpretation, i.e.
Born's rule, holds provided the underlying model has only dimensionless
parameters.
"
What are the K-factors at the LHC?,"  The scale invariant unparticle physics recently proposed by Georgi could
manifest at low energies as non integral number d_U of invisible particles.
Unparticles if existing, could couple to the Standard Model fields and
consequently affect the collider phenomenology. We consider the DY process to
explore effects of the peculiar propagator of the scalar and tensor unparticle
operators. To probe these effects at hadron collider one needs to go beyond LO
in QCD and hence the quantitative impact of QCD corrections for unparticle
physics at LHC is investigated. We present the K-factors at LHC. Inclusion of
QCD corrections to NLO stabilises the cross section with respect to scale
variations.
"
What is the meaning of the sufficient condition for isotopy-isomorphy in WIPLs?,"  Two distinct isotopy-isomorphy conditions, different from those of J. M.
Osborn and Wilson's condition, for a weak inverse property loop(WIPL) are
shown. Only one of them characterizes isotopy-isomorphy in WIPLs while the
other is just a sufficient condition for isotopy-isomorphy. Under the
sufficient condition called the ${\cal T}$ condition, Artzy's result that
isotopic cross inverse property loops(CIPL) are isomorphic is proved for WIP
loops.
"
What is the relationship between the stability condition and the departure process in equilibrium?,"  Consider the single server queue with an infinite buffer and a FIFO
discipline, either of type M/M/1 or Geom/Geom/1. Denote by A the arrival
process and by s the services. Assume the stability condition to be satisfied.
Denote by D the departure process in equilibrium and by r the time spent by the
customers at the very back of the queue. We prove that (D,r) has the same law
as (A,s) which is an extension of the classical Burke Theorem. In fact, r can
be viewed as the departures from a dual storage model. This duality between the
two models also appears when studying the transient behavior of a tandem by
means of the RSK algorithm: the first and last row of the resulting
semi-standard Young tableau are respectively the last instant of departure in
the queue and the total number of departures in the store.
"
What is the predicted mass scale of supersymmetric particles and electroweak scale?,"  We find that there is no supersymmetric flavor/CP problem, mu-problem,
cosmological moduli/gravitino problem or dimension four/five proton decay
problem in a class of supersymmetric theories with O(1) GeV gravitino mass. The
cosmic abundance of the non-thermally produced gravitinos naturally explains
the dark matter component of the universe. A mild hierarchy between the mass
scale of supersymmetric particles and electroweak scale is predicted,
consistent with the null result of a search for the Higgs boson at the LEP-II
experiments. A relation to the strong CP problem is addressed. We propose a
parametrization of the model for the purpose of collider studies. The scalar
tau lepton is the next to lightest supersymmetric particle in a theoretically
favored region of the parameter space. The lifetime of the scalar tau is of
O(1000) seconds with which it is regarded as a charged stable particle in
collider experiments. We discuss characteristic signatures and a strategy for
confirmation of this class of theories at the LHC experiments.
"
What is the limit for the oscillation time of the neutron to a mirror neutron transition?,"  The idea of a hidden sector of mirror partners of elementary particles has
attracted considerable interest as a possible candidate for dark matter.
Recently it was pointed out by Berezhiani and Bento that the present
experimental data cannot exclude the possibility of a rapid oscillation of the
neutron n to a mirror neutron n' with oscillation time much smaller than the
neutron lifetime. A dedicated search for vacuum transitions n->n' has to be
performed at weak magnetic field, where both states are degenerate. We report
the result of our experiment, which compares rates of ultracold neutrons after
storage at a weak magnetic field well below 20 nT and at a magnetic field
strong enough to suppress the seeked transitions. We obtain a new limit for the
oscillation time of n-n' transitions, tau_osc (90% C.L.) > 414 s. The
corresponding limit for the mixing energy of the normal and mirror neutron
states is delta_m (90% C.L.) < 1.5x10-18 eV.
"
What are the signatures of the particle spectrum of the single-sector models?,"  We propose a gravitational dual of ``single-sector'' models of supersymmetry
breaking which contain no messenger sector and naturally explain the scale of
supersymmetry breaking and the fermion mass hierarchy. In five dimensions these
models can be given a simple interpretation. Inspired by flux-background
solutions of type IIB supergravity, a metric background that deviates from
AdS_5 in the IR breaks supersymmetry, while the fermion mass hierarchy results
from the wavefunction overlap of bulk fermions with a UV-confined Higgs field.
The first and second generation squarks and sleptons, which are localized near
the IR brane, directly feel the supersymmetry breaking and obtain masses of
order 10 TeV. These are interpreted as composite states of the dual 4D theory.
The gauginos and third generation squarks and sleptons are elementary states
that obtain soft masses of order 1 TeV at the loop level via direct gauge
mediation. This particle spectrum leads to distinctive signatures at the LHC,
similar to the usual gauge mediation with a neutralino NLSP that decays
promptly to a gravitino LSP, but with lower event rates. Nevertheless we show
that with 1-10 fb^{-1} of LHC data ""single-sector"" models can easily be
detected above background and distinguished from conventional gravity and gauge
mediation.
"
What are the classes of sparse graphs?,"  A {\bf map} is a graph that admits an orientation of its edges so that each
vertex has out-degree exactly 1. We characterize graphs which admit a
decomposition into $k$ edge-disjoint maps after: (1) the addition of {\it any}
$\ell$ edges; (2) the addition of {\it some} $\ell$ edges. These graphs are
identified with classes of {\it sparse} graphs; the results are also given in
matroidal terms.
"
Can the generation of positional information and network formation occur in parallel on a comparable time scale?,"  Is it possible to link a set of nodes without using preexisting positional
information or any kind of long-range attraction of the nodes? Can the process
of generating positional information, i.e. the detection of ``unknown'' nodes
and the estabishment of chemical gradients, \emph{and} the process of network
formation, i.e. the establishment of links between nodes, occur in parallel, on
a comparable time scale, as a process of co-evolution?
  The paper discusses a model where the generation of relevant information for
establishing the links between nodes results from the interaction of many
\emph{agents}, i.e. subunits of the system that are capable of performing some
activities. Their collective interaction is based on (indirect) communication,
which also includes memory effects and the dissemination of information in the
system. The relevant (``pragmatic'') information that leads to the
establishment of the links then emerges from an evolutionary interplay of
selection and reamplification.
"
What is the precision and accuracy of the evolutionary methods for image registration?,"  This paper investigates the use of evolutionary optimisation techniques to
register a template with a scene image. An error function is created to measure
the correspondence of the template to the image. The problem presented here is
to optimise the horizontal, vertical and scaling parameters that register the
template with the scene. The Genetic Algorithm, Simulated Annealing and
Particle Swarm Optimisations are compared to a Nelder-Mead Simplex optimisation
with starting points chosen in a pre-processing stage. The paper investigates
the precision and accuracy of each method and shows that all four methods
perform favourably for image registration. SA is the most precise, GA is the
most accurate. PSO is a good mix of both and the Simplex method returns local
minima the most. A pre-processing stage should be investigated for the
evolutionary methods in order to improve performance. Discrete versions of the
optimisation methods should be investigated to further improve computational
performance.
"
What are the field redefinitions in the Lorentz Chern-Simons term?,"  In this letter we establish that the supersymmetric R^2 effective action for
the heterotic string, obtained from the supersymmetrisation of the Lorentz
Chern-Simons term, is to order $\alpha'$ equivalent modulo field redefinitions
to heterotic string effective actions computed by different methods.
"
What is the range of electron concentrations for which ferromagnetic correlations are observed?,"  The magnetic susceptibility of the two-dimensional repulsive Hubbard model
with nearest-neighbor hopping is investigated using the diagram technique
developed for the case of strong correlations. In this technique a power series
in the hopping constant is used. At half-filling the calculated zero-frequency
susceptibility and the square of the site spin reproduce adequately results of
Monte Carlo simulations. Also in agreement with numerical simulations no
evidence of ferromagnetic correlations was found in the considered range of
electron concentrations $0.8\alt\bar{n}\alt 1.2$ for the repulsion parameters
$8|t|\leq U\leq 16|t|$. However, for larger $U/|t|$ and $|1-\bar{n}|\approx
0.2$ the nearest neighbor correlations become ferromagnetic. For $\bar{n}\alt
0.94$ and $\bar{n}\agt 1.06$ the imaginary part of the real-frequency
susceptibility becomes incommensurate for small frequencies. The
incommensurability parameter grows with departure from half-filling and
decreases with increasing the frequency. This behavior of the susceptibility
can explain the observed low-frequency incommensurate response observed in
normal-state lanthanum cuprates.
"
What are the attractor solutions of quintessence and phantom field in the statefinder parameters plane?,"  We study the statefinder parameter in the five-dimensional big bounce model,
and apply it to differentiate the attractor solutions of quintessence and
phantom field. It is found that the evolving trajectories of these two
attractor solutions in the statefinder parameters plane are quite different,
and that are different from the statefinder trajectories of other dark energy
models.
"
What are the conditions for a Fuchsian system to be analytically equivalent to its linear part?,"  Nonlinear perturbation of Fuchsian systems are studied in regions including
two singularities. Such systems are not necessarily analytically equivalent to
their linear part (they are not linearizable). Nevertheless, it is shown that
in the case when the linear part has commuting monodromy, and the eigenvalues
have positive real parts, there exists a unique correction function of the
nonlinear part so that the corrected system becomes analytically linearizable.
"
What are the geometric properties of a discrete Willmore energy?,"  In the search for appropriate discretizations of surface theory it is crucial
to preserve such fundamental properties of surfaces as their invariance with
respect to transformation groups. We discuss discretizations based on M\""obius
invariant building blocks such as circles and spheres. Concrete problems
considered in these lectures include the Willmore energy as well as conformal
and curvature line parametrizations of surfaces. In particular we discuss
geometric properties of a recently found discrete Willmore energy. The
convergence to the smooth Willmore functional is shown for special refinements
of triangulations originating from a curvature line parametrization of a
surface. Further we treat special classes of discrete surfaces such as
isothermic and minimal. The construction of these surfaces is based on the
theory of circle patterns, in particular on their variational description.
"
What is the theoretical description of longitudinal atomic beam spin echo experiments?,"  We present a nonrelativistic theory for the quantum mechanical description of
longitudinal atomic beam spin echo experiments, where a beam of neutral atoms
is subjected to static electric and magnetic fields. The atomic wave function
is the solution of a matrix-valued Schroedinger equation and can be written as
superposition of local (atomic) eigenstates of the potential matrix. The
position- and time-dependent amplitude function of each eigenstate represents
an atomic wave packet and can be calculated in a series expansion with a master
formula that we derive. The zeroth order of this series expansion describes the
adiabatic limit, whereas the higher order contributions contain the mixing of
the eigenstates and the corresponding amplitude functions.
  We give a tutorial for the theoretical description of longitudinal atomic
beam spin echo experiments and for the so-called Fahrplan model, which is a
visualisation tool for the propagation of wave packets of different atomic
eigenstates.
  As an example for the application of our theory, we study parity violating
geometric (Berry-)phases. In this context, we define geometric flux densities,
which for certain field configurations can be used to illustrate geometric
phases in a vector diagram. Considering an example with a specific field
configuration, we prove the existence of a parity violating geometric phase.
"
What are the effects of diluting Mn with Al or Ti on the ferromagnetic transition temperature Tc in La0.7Sr0.3MnO3?,"  The magnetic lattice of mixed-valence Mn ions in
La$_{0.7}$Sr$_{0.3}$MnO$_{3}$ is selectively diluted by partial substitution of
Al or Ti for Mn. The ferromagnetic transition temperature $T_\mathrm{c}$ and
the saturation magnetization $M_\mathrm{s}$ both decrease with substitution. By
presenting the data in terms of selective dilution, $T_\mathrm{c}$ in the
low-doping region is found to follow the relation
$T_\mathrm{c}=T_\mathrm{c0}(1-n_\mathrm{p})$, where $T_\mathrm{c0}$ refers to
the undiluted system and $n_\mathrm{p}$ is the dilution concentration defined
as $n_\mathrm{p}=x/0.7$ or $n_\mathrm{p}=x/0.3$ for $M^\prime=$ Al or Ti,
respectively. The scaling behavior of $T_\mathrm{c}(n_\mathrm{p})$ can be
analyzed in the framework of the molecular-field theory and still valid when Mn
is substituted by both Al and Ti. The results are discussed with respect to the
contributions from ferromagnetic double exchange and other possible
antiferromagnetic superexchange interactions coexisting in the material.
"
What is the explicit expression for the colored Motzkin numbers of higher rank?,"  The generating function and an explicit expression is derived for the
(colored) Motzkin numbers of higher rank introduced recently. Considering the
special case of rank one yields the corresponding results for the conventional
colored Motzkin numbers for which in addition a recursion relation is given.
"
What is the spin dynamics within the Keldysh formalism used to analyze the dynamics of many-spin systems interacting with a spin bath?,"  The control of open quantum systems has a fundamental relevance for fields
ranging from quantum information processing to nanotechnology. Typically, the
system whose coherent dynamics one wants to manipulate, interacts with an
environment that smoothly degrades its quantum dynamics. Thus, a precise
understanding of the inner mechanisms of this process, called ""decoherence"", is
critical to develop strategies to control the quantum dynamics. In this thesis
we solved the generalized Liouville-von Neumann quantum master equation to
obtain the dynamics of many-spin systems interacting with a spin bath. We also
solve the spin dynamics within the Keldysh formalism. Both methods lead to
identical solutions and together gave us the possibility to obtain numerous
physical predictions that contrast well with Nuclear Magnetic Resonance
experiments. We applied these tools for molecular characterizations,
development of new numerical methodologies and the control of quantum dynamics
in experimental implementations. But, more important, these results contributed
to fundamental physical interpretations of how quantum dynamics behaves in open
systems. In particular, we found a manifestation of an environmentally induced
quantum dynamical phase transition.
"
What is the current understanding of the Friedmann-Lemaitre universe?,"  General relativity marked the beginning of modern cosmology and it has since
been at the centre of many of the key developments in this field. In the
present review, we discuss the general-relativistic dynamics and perturbations
of the standard cosmological model, the Friedmann-Lemaitre universe, and how
these can explain and predict the properties of the observable universe. Our
aim is to provide an overview of the progress made in several major research
areas, such as linear and non-linear cosmological perturbations, large-scale
structure formation and the physics of the cosmic microwave background
radiation, in view of current and upcoming observations. We do this by using a
single formalism throughout the review, the 1+3 covariant approach to
cosmology, which allows for a uniform and balanced presentation of technical
information and physical insight.
"
What are the key methods for characterizing the synaptic activity in cortical neurons?,"  Cortical neurons are subject to sustained and irregular synaptic activity
which causes important fluctuations of the membrane potential (Vm). We review
here different methods to characterize this activity and its impact on spike
generation. The simplified, fluctuating point-conductance model of synaptic
activity provides the starting point of a variety of methods for the analysis
of intracellular Vm recordings. In this model, the synaptic excitatory and
inhibitory conductances are described by Gaussian-distributed stochastic
variables, or colored conductance noise. The matching of experimentally
recorded Vm distributions to an invertible theoretical expression derived from
the model allows the extraction of parameters characterizing the synaptic
conductance distributions. This analysis can be complemented by the matching of
experimental Vm power spectral densities (PSDs) to a theoretical template, even
though the unexpected scaling properties of experimental PSDs limit the
precision of this latter approach. Building on this stochastic characterization
of synaptic activity, we also propose methods to qualitatively and
quantitatively evaluate spike-triggered averages of synaptic time-courses
preceding spikes. This analysis points to an essential role for synaptic
conductance variance in determining spike times. The presented methods are
evaluated using controlled conductance injection in cortical neurons in vitro
with the dynamic-clamp technique. We review their applications to the analysis
of in vivo intracellular recordings in cat association cortex, which suggest a
predominant role for inhibition in determining both sub- and supra-threshold
dynamics of cortical neurons embedded in active networks.
"
How does the Lloyd model relate to the transport equation?,"  We introduce phase disorder in a 1D quantum resistor through the formal
device of `fake channels' distributed uniformly over its length such that the
out-coupled wave amplitude is re-injected back into the system, but with a
phase which is random. The associated scattering problem is treated via
invariant imbedding in the continuum limit, and the resulting transport
equation is found to correspond exactly to the Lloyd model. The latter has been
a subject of much interest in recent years. This conversion of the random phase
into the random Cauchy potential is a notable feature of our work. It is
further argued that our phase-randomizing reservoir, as distinct from the well
known phase-breaking reservoirs, induces no decoherence, but essentially
destroys all interference effects other than the coherent back scattering.
"
How do the fluctuations in the synthesis of RNA depend on the concentrations of the RNA polymerases as well as on those of some of the reactants and the products of the enzymatic reactions catalyzed by RNA polymerase?,"  RNA polymerase (RNAP) is an enzyme that synthesizes a messenger RNA (mRNA)
strand which is complementary to a single-stranded DNA template. From the
perspective of physicists, an RNAP is a molecular motor that utilizes chemical
energy input to move along the track formed by a DNA. In many circumstances,
which are described in this paper, a large number of RNAPs move simultaneously
along the same track; we refer to such collective movements of the RNAPs as
RNAP traffic. Here we develop a theoretical model for RNAP traffic by
incorporating the steric interactions between RNAPs as well as the
mechano-chemical cycle of individual RNAPs during the elongation of the mRNA.
By a combination of analytical and numerical techniques, we calculate the rates
of mRNA synthesis and the average density profile of the RNAPs on the DNA
track. We also introduce, and compute, two new measures of fluctuations in the
synthesis of RNA. Analyzing these fluctuations, we show how the level of {\it
intrinsic noise} in mRNA synthesis depends on the concentrations of the RNAPs
as well as on those of some of the reactants and the products of the enzymatic
reactions catalyzed by RNAP. We suggest appropriate experimental systems and
techniques for testing our theoretical predictions.
"
What is the boundary measure at scale r of a compact subset of the n-dimensional Euclidean space?,"  We introduce the boundary measure at scale r of a compact subset of the
n-dimensional Euclidean space. We show how it can be computed for point clouds
and suggest these measures can be used for feature detection. The main
contribution of this work is the proof a quantitative stability theorem for
boundary measures using tools of convex analysis and geometric measure theory.
As a corollary we obtain a stability result for Federer's curvature measures of
a compact, allowing to compute them from point-cloud approximations of the
compact.
"
What is the spine-sheath structure in rotating black holes?,"  A new general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (GRMHD) code ``RAISHIN'' used
to simulate jet generation by rotating and non-rotating black holes with a
geometrically thin Keplarian accretion disk finds that the jet develops a
spine-sheath structure in the rotating black hole case. Spine-sheath structure
and strong magnetic fields significantly modify the Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH)
velocity shear driven instability. The RAISHIN code has been used in its
relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (RMHD) configuration to study the effects of
strong magnetic fields and weakly relativistic sheath motion, c/2, on the KH
instability associated with a relativistic, Lorentz factor equal 2.5, jet
spine-sheath interaction. In the simulations sound speeds up to c/1.7 and
Alfven wave speeds up to 0.56 c are considered. Numerical simulation results
are compared to theoretical predictions from a new normal mode analysis of the
RMHD equations. Increased stability of a weakly magnetized system resulting
from c/2 sheath speeds and stabilization of a strongly magnetized system
resulting from c/2 sheath speeds is found.
"
What are the closed-form expressions for the average bit error probability (BEP) of the optimum diversity receiver?,"  This paper is concerned with optimum diversity receiver structure and its
performance analysis of differential phase shift keying (DPSK) with
differential detection over nonselective, independent, nonidentically
distributed, Rayleigh fading channels. The fading process in each branch is
assumed to have an arbitrary Doppler spectrum with arbitrary Doppler bandwidth,
but to have distinct, asymmetric fading power spectral density characteristic.
Using 8-DPSK as an example, the average bit error probability (BEP) of the
optimum diversity receiver is obtained by calculating the BEP for each of the
three individual bits. The BEP results derived are given in exact, explicit,
closed-form expressions which show clearly the behavior of the performance as a
function of various system parameters.
"
What is the r-process in a low temperature environment?,"  The r-process in a low temperature environment is explored, in which the
neutron emission by photodisintegration does not play a role (cold r-process).
A semi-analytic neutrino-driven wind model is utilized for this purpose. The
temperature in a supersonically expanding outflow can quickly drop to a few
10^8 K, where the (n, gamma)-(gamma, n) equilibrium is never achieved during
the heavy r-nuclei synthesis. In addition, the neutron capture competes with
the beta-decay owing to the low matter density. Despite such non-standard
physical conditions for the cold r-process, a solar-like r-process abundance
curve can be reproduced. The cold r-process predicts, however, the low lead
production compared to that expected in the traditional r-process conditions,
which can be a possible explanation for the low lead abundances found in a
couple of r-process-rich Galactic halo stars.
"
Your letter was a response to the article on chiral,"  I respond to the Bernard et al. comment on my letter ``Chiral anomalies and
rooted staggered fermions.''
"
What is the relationship between the generalized μ-τ symmetry and the removal of the contradiction between the CKM matrix and current evidence?,"  The multi-Higgs models having spontaneous CP violation (SPCV) and natural
flavor conservation (NFC) lead to a real CKM matrix $V$ contradicting current
evidence in favour of a complex $V$. This contradiction can be removed by using
a generalized $\mu$-$\tau$ (called 23) symmetry in place of the discrete
symmetry conventionally used to obtain NFC. If 23 symmetry is exact then the
Higgs induced flavour changing neutral currents (FCNC) vanish as in case of
NFC. 23 breaking introduces SPCV, a phase in $V$ and suppressed FCNC among
quarks. The FCNC couplings $F_{ij}^{d,u}$ between $i$ and $j$ generations show
a hierarchy $|F_{12}^{d,u}|<|F_{13}^{d,u}|<|F_{23}^{d,u}|$ with the result that
the FCNC can have observable consequences in $B$ mixing without conflicting
with the $K^0-\bar{K}^0$ mixing. Detailed fits to the quark masses and the CKM
matrix are used to obtain the (complex) couplings $F_{ij}^d$ and $F_{ij}^u$.
Combined constraints from flavour and CP violations in the $K,B_d,B_s,D$ mesons
are analyzed within the model. They allow ($i$) relatively light Higgs, 100-150
GeV ($ii$) measurable extra contributions to the magnitudes and phases of the
$B^0_{d,s}-\bar{B}^0_{d,s}$ mixing amplitudes and ($iii$) the $D^0-\bar{D}^0$
mixing at the current sensitivity level.
"
What are the patterns of low energy superparticle masses in the LHC?,"  We discuss some features of supersymmetry breaking induced by a
brane-localized source which is stabilized at the IR end of warped throat, and
also the resulting mirage mediation pattern of soft terms of the visible fields
which are localized in the bulk space corresponding to the UV end of throat.
Such supersymmetry breaking scheme can be naturally realized in KKLT-type
string compactification, and predicts highly distinctive pattern of low energy
superparticle masses which might be tested at the LHC.
"
What are the distributions of the spacing s between nearest-neighbor levels of unfolded spectra of random matrices from the beta-Hermite ensemble?,"  The distributions of the spacing s between nearest-neighbor levels of
unfolded spectra of random matrices from the beta-Hermite ensemble (beta-HE) is
investigated by Monte Carlo simulations. The random matrices from the beta-HE
are real-symmetric and tridiagonal where beta, which can take any positive
value, is the reciprocal of the temperature in the classical electrostatic
interpretation of eigenvalues. Generalized gamma distributions are shown to be
excellent approximations of the nearest-neighbor spacing (NNS) distributions
for any beta while being still simple. They account both for the level
repulsion when s tends to zero and for the whole shape of the NNS distributions
in the range of s which is accessible to experiment or to most numerical
simulations. The exact NNS distribution of the GOE (beta=1) is in particular
significantly better described by a generalized gamma distribution than it is
by the Wigner surmise while the best generalized gamma approximation coincides
essentially with the Wigner surmise for beta larger than ~2. The distributions
of the minimum NN spacing between eigenvalues of matrices from the beta-HE,
obtained both from as-calculated eigenvalues and from unfolded eigenvalues are
Brody distributions.
"
What is the least-area hypersurface enclosing and separating two given volumes in R^n?,"  The least-area hypersurface enclosing and separating two given volumes in R^n
is the standard double bubble.
"
What is the concept of toroidization and its relation to the toroidal moment?,"  We present a theoretical analysis of magnetic toroidal moments in periodic
systems, in the limit in which the toroidal moments are caused by a time and
space reversal symmetry breaking arrangement of localized magnetic dipole
moments. We summarize the basic definitions for finite systems and address the
question of how to generalize these definitions to the bulk periodic case. We
define the toroidization as the toroidal moment per unit cell volume, and we
show that periodic boundary conditions lead to a multivaluedness of the
toroidization, which suggests that only differences in toroidization are
meaningful observable quantities. Our analysis bears strong analogy to the
modern theory of electric polarization in bulk periodic systems, but we also
point out some important differences between the two cases. We then discuss the
instructive example of a one-dimensional chain of magnetic moments, and we show
how to properly calculate changes of the toroidization for this system.
Finally, we evaluate and discuss the toroidization (in the local dipole limit)
of four important example materials: BaNiF_4, LiCoPO_4, GaFeO_3, and BiFeO_3.
"
What is the relationship between the modular forms of the Hasse-Weil L-series and the Hasse-Weil L-series?,"  In this note a prediction of an algebraic mirror construction is checked for
elliptic curves of Brieskorn-Pham type via number theoretic methods. It is
shown that the modular forms associated to the Hasse-Weil L-series of mirror
pairs of such curves are identical.
"
What is the plateau in the ratio of transverse momentum distribution of thermal photons to dilepton?,"  The ratio of transverse momentum distribution of thermal photons to dilepton
has been evaluated. It is observed that this ratio reaches a plateau beyond a
certain value of transverse momentum. We argue that this ratio can be used to
estimate the initial temperature of the system by selecting the transverse
momentum and invariance mass windows judiciously. It is demonstrated that if
the radial flow is large then the plateau disappear and hence a deviation from
the plateau can be used as an indicator of large radial flow. The sensitivity
of the results on various input parameters has been studied.
"
What are the tensor and vector NNρ coupling constants that can be estimated with the pion-nucleon scattering amplitude?,"  This is the 6th paper in the series developing the formalism to manage the
effective scattering theory of strong interactions. Relying on the theoretical
scheme suggested in our previous publications we concentrate here on the
practical aspect and apply our technique to the elastic pion-nucleon scattering
amplitude. We test numerically the pion-nucleon spectrum sum rules that follow
from the tree level bootstrap constraints. We show how these constraints can be
used to estimate the tensor and vector $NN\rho$ coupling constants. At last, we
demonstrate that the tree-level low energy expansion coefficients computed in
the framework of our approach show nice agreement with known experimental data.
These results allow us to claim that the extended perturbation scheme is quite
reasonable from the computational point of view.
"
What are the bounds on the rates of convergence in terms of the Prokhorov metric?,"  We consider the weak convergence of numerical methods for stochastic
differential equations (SDEs). Weak convergence is usually expressed in terms
of the convergence of expected values of test functions of the trajectories.
Here we present an alternative formulation of weak convergence in terms of the
well-known Prokhorov metric on spaces of random variables. For a general class
of methods, we establish bounds on the rates of convergence in terms of the
Prokhorov metric. In doing so, we revisit the original proofs of weak
convergence and show explicitly how the bounds on the error depend on the
smoothness of the test functions. As an application of our result, we use the
Strassen - Dudley theorem to show that the numerical approximation and the true
solution to the system of SDEs can be re-embedded in a probability space in
such a way that the method converges there in a strong sense. One corollary of
this last result is that the method converges in the Wasserstein distance,
another metric on spaces of random variables. Another corollary establishes
rates of convergence for expected values of test functions assuming only local
Lipschitz continuity. We conclude with a review of the existing results for
pathwise convergence of weakly converging methods and the corresponding strong
results available under re-embedding.
"
What are the new fixed-time estimates for the Schrödinger equation with potentials $V(x)=\pm|x|^2$?,"  We study the action of metaplectic operators on Wiener amalgam spaces, giving
upper bounds for their norms. As an application, we obtain new fixed-time
estimates in these spaces for Schr\""odinger equations with general quadratic
Hamiltonians and Strichartz estimates for the Schr\""odinger equation with
potentials $V(x)=\pm|x|^2$.
"
What is the shape of the wave pattern generated by a circularly moving needle in contact with water?,"  We investigate theoretically and experimentally the capillary-gravity waves
created by a small object moving steadily at the water-air interface along a
circular trajectory. It is well established that, for straight uniform motion,
no steady waves appear at velocities below the minimum phase velocity $c_{min}
= 23 \rm{cm \cdot s}^{-1}$. We show theoretically that no such velocity
threshold exists for a steady circular motion, for which, even at small
velocities, a finite wave drag is experienced by the object. This wave drag
originates from the emission of a spiral-like wave pattern. Our results are in
good agreement with direct experimental observations of the wave pattern
created by a circularly moving needle in contact with water. Our study leads to
new insights into the problem of animal locomotion at the water-air interface.
"
What is the Klimontovich S theorem used to remedy the deficiency of Boltzmann-Gibbs entropy?,"  Ordinary Boltzmann-Gibbs entropy is inadequate to be used in systems
depending on a control parameter that yield different mean energy values. Such
systems fail to give the correct comparison between the off-equilibrium and
equilibrium entropy values. Klimontovich's S theorem solves this problem by
renormalizing energy and making use of escort distributions. Since nonextensive
thermostatistics is a generalization of Boltzmann-Gibbs entropy, it too
exhibits this same deficiency. In order to remedy this, we present the
nonextensive generalization of Klimontovich's S theorem. We show that this
generalization requires the use of ordinary probability and the associated
relative entropy in addition to the renormalization of energy. Lastly, we
illustrate the generalized S theorem for the Van der Pol oscillator.
"
What is the relationship between the Gibbs measure and the translation-invariant Gibbs measure?,"  We consider gradient fields $(\phi_x:x\in \mathbb{Z}^d)$ whose law takes the
Gibbs--Boltzmann form $Z^{-1}\exp\{-\sum_{< x,y>}V(\phi_y-\phi_x)\}$, where the
sum runs over nearest neighbors. We assume that the potential $V$ admits the
representation \[V(\eta):=-\log\int\varrho({d}\kappa)\exp\biggl[-{1/2}\kappa\et
a^2\biggr],\] where $\varrho$ is a positive measure with compact support in
$(0,\infty)$. Hence, the potential $V$ is symmetric, but nonconvex in general.
While for strictly convex $V$'s, the translation-invariant, ergodic gradient
Gibbs measures are completely characterized by their tilt, a nonconvex
potential as above may lead to several ergodic gradient Gibbs measures with
zero tilt. Still, every ergodic, zero-tilt gradient Gibbs measure for the
potential $V$ above scales to a Gaussian free field.
"
What are the key concepts of the generalized Langevin equation of motion?,"  Using a generalized Langevin equation of motion, quantum ballistic thermal
transport is obtained from classical molecular dynamics. This is possible
because the heat baths are represented by random noises obeying quantum
Bose-Einstein statistics. The numerical method gives asymptotically exact
results in both the low-temperature ballistic transport regime and
high-temperature strongly nonlinear classical regime. The method can be thought
of as a semi-classical approximation to the quantum transport problem. A
one-dimensional quartic on-site model is used to demonstrate the crossover from
ballistic to diffusive thermal transport.
"
What are the distinct spin wave modes observed in a ferromagnet with finite size?,"  The ground state carrier dynamics in self-assembled (In,Ga)As/GaAs quantum
dots has been studied using time-resolved photoluminescence and transmission.
By varying the dot design with respect to confinement and doping, the dynamics
is shown to follow in general a non-exponential decay. Only for specific
conditions in regard to optical excitation and carrier population, for example,
the decay can be well described by a mono-exponential form. For resonant
excitation of the ground state transition a strong shortening of the
luminescence decay time is observed as compared to the non-resonant case. The
results are consistent with a microscopic theory that accounts for deviations
from a simple two-level picture.
"
What is the role of the network's shape in the enhancement of the zero-voltage Josephson currents in superconducting arrays?,"  The spontaneous emergence of enhanced responses and local orders are
properties often associated with complex matter where nonlinearities and
spatial inhomogeneities dominate. We discuss these phenomena in quantum devices
realized with superconducting Josephson junction networks and cold atoms in
optical lattices. We evidence how the pertinent engineering of the network's
shape induces the enhancement of the zero-voltage Josephson critical currents
in superconducting arrays as well as the emergence of spatially localized
condensates for cold atoms in inhomogeneous optical lattices.
"
What are the physical processes that attenuate the passage of light through the Earth's atmosphere?,"  Motivated by the recognition that variation in the optical transmission of
the atmosphere is probably the main limitation to the precision of ground-based
CCD measurements of celestial fluxes, we review the physical processes that
attenuate the passage of light through the Earth's atmosphere. The next
generation of astronomical surveys, such as PanSTARRS and LSST, will greatly
benefit from dedicated apparatus to obtain atmospheric transmission data that
can be associated with each survey image. We review and compare various
approaches to this measurement problem, including photometry, spectroscopy, and
LIDAR. In conjunction with careful measurements of instrumental throughput,
atmospheric transmission measurements should allow next-generation imaging
surveys to produce photometry of unprecedented precision. Our primary concerns
are the real-time determination of aerosol scattering and absorption by water
along the line of sight, both of which can vary over the course of a night's
observations.
"
What are the main differences between the dual amplitude and Metropolis moves in SU(2) Yang-Mills theories?,"  In the past several decades there have been a number of proposals for
computing with dual forms of non-abelian Yang-Mills theories on the lattice.
Motivated by the gauge-invariant, geometric picture offered by dual models and
successful applications of duality in the U(1) case, we revisit the question of
whether it is practical to perform numerical computation using non-abelian dual
models. Specifically, we consider three-dimensional SU(2) pure Yang-Mills as an
accessible yet non-trivial case in which the gauge group is non-abelian. Using
methods developed recently in the context of spin foam quantum gravity, we
derive an algorithm for efficiently computing the dual amplitude and describe
Metropolis moves for sampling the dual ensemble. We relate our algorithms to
prior work in non-abelian dual computations of Hari Dass and his collaborators,
addressing several problems that have been left open. We report results of spin
expectation value computations over a range of lattice sizes and couplings that
are in agreement with our conventional lattice computations. We conclude with
an outlook on further development of dual methods and their application to
problems of current interest.
"
What are the key concepts in the ensemble of hierarchically nested random graphs?,"  Extracting understanding from the growing ``sea'' of biological and
socio-economic data is one of the most pressing scientific challenges facing
us. Here, we introduce and validate an unsupervised method that is able to
accurately extract the hierarchical organization of complex biological, social,
and technological networks. We define an ensemble of hierarchically nested
random graphs, which we use to validate the method. We then apply our method to
real-world networks, including the air-transportation network, an electronic
circuit, an email exchange network, and metabolic networks. We find that our
method enables us to obtain an accurate multi-scale descriptions of a complex
system.
"
"What are the two versions of the fast, purely reflective Paul-Baker type telescope?","  Two versions of a fast, purely reflective Paul-Baker type telescope are
discussed, each with an 8.4-m aperture, 3 deg diameter flat field and f/1.25
focal ratio.
  The first version is based on a common, even asphere type of surface with
zero conic constant. The primary and tertiary mirrors are 6th order aspheres,
while the secondary mirror is an 8th order asphere (referred to here for
brevity, as the 6/8/6 configuration). The D_80 diameter of a star image varies
from 0''.18 on the optical axis up to 0''.27 at the edge of the field (9.3-13.5
mcm).
  The second version of the telescope is based on a polysag surface type which
uses a polynomial expansion in the sag z, r^2 = 2R_0z - (1+b)z^2 + a_3 z^3 +
a_4 z^4 + ... + a_N z^N, instead of the common form of an aspheric surface.
This approach results in somewhat better images, with D_80 ranging from 0''.16
to 0''.23, using a lower-order 3/4/3 combination of powers for the mirror
surfaces. An additional example with 3.5-m aperture, 3.5 deg diameter flat
field, and f/1.25 focal ratio featuring near-diffraction-limited image quality
is also presented.
"
What are the implications of the Wess-Zumino-Witten term in the context of the Little Higgs theory?,"  Little Higgs theories often rely on an internal parity (""T-parity'') to
suppress non-standard electroweak effects or to provide a dark matter
candidate. We show that such a symmetry is generally broken by anomalies, as
described by the Wess-Zumino-Witten term. We study a simple SU(3) x SU(3)/SU(3)
Little Higgs scheme where we obtain a minimal form for the topological
interactions of a single Higgs field. The results apply to more general models,
including [SU(3) x SU(3)/SU(3)]^4, SU(5)/SO(5), and SU(6)/Sp(6).
"
What is the relationship between the string model and the dual field theory?,"  We consider a non-critical five dimensional string setup which could provide
a dual description of QCD in the limit of large number of colors and flavors.
The model corresponds to N_c color D3-branes and N_f D4/anti D4-brane pairs
supporting flavor degrees of freedom. The matching of the string model spectrum
with the dual field theory one is considered. We discuss the consequences of
the possible matching of the gravity modes with the light glueballs and the
interpretation of the brane spectrum in Yang-Mills and QCD.
"
What are the nearest neighbor distributions of atoms at the surface of liquid metal surfaces?,"  Atoms at liquid metal surfaces are known to form layers parallel to the
surface. We analyze the two-dimensional arrangement of atoms within such layers
at the surface of liquid sodium, using ab initio molecular dynamics (MD)
simulations based on density functional theory. Nearest neighbor distributions
at the surface indicate mostly 5-fold coordination, though there are noticeable
fractions of 4-fold and 6-fold coordinated atoms. Bond angle distributions
suggest a movement toward the angles corresponding to a six-fold coordinated
hexagonal arrangement of the atoms as the temperature is decreased towards the
solidification point. We rationalize these results with a distorted hexagonal
order at the surface, showing a mixture of regions of five and six-fold
coordination. The liquid surface results are compared with classical MD
simulations of the liquid surface, with similar effects appearing, and with ab
initio MD simulations for a model solid-liquid interface, where a pronounced
shift towards hexagonal ordering is observed as the temperature is lowered.
"
What are the implications of collider measurements for our understanding of the universe?,"  If the cold dark matter consists of weakly interacting massive particles
(WIMPs), anticipated measurements of the WIMP properties at the Large Hadron
Collider (LHC) and the International Linear Collider (ILC) will provide an
unprecedented experimental probe of cosmology at temperatures of order 1 GeV.
It is worth emphasizing that the expected outcome of these tests may or may not
be consistent with the picture of standard cosmology. For example, in
kination-dominated quintessence models of dark energy, the dark matter relic
abundance can be significantly enhanced compared to that obtained from freeze
out in a radiation-dominated universe. Collider measurements then will
simultaneously probe both dark matter and dark energy. In this article, we
investigate the precision to which the LHC and ILC can determine the dark
matter and dark energy parameters under those circumstances. We use an
illustrative set of four benchmark points in minimal supergravity in analogy
with the four LCC benchmark points. The precision achievable together at the
LHC and ILC is sufficient to discover kination-dominated quintessence, under
the assumption that the WIMPs are the only dark matter component. The LHC and
ILC can thus play important roles as alternative probes of both dark matter and
dark energy.
"
What are the implications of the integrated cross section and rapidity distribution for J/Psi and Upsilon production for the LHC?,"  The photoproduction of quarkonium in coherent hadron-hadron (pp/pA/AA$)
interactions for LHC energies is an important tool to investigate the QCD
dynamics at high energies. In this paper we estimate the integrated cross
section and rapidity distribution for J/Psi and Upsilon production using the
Color Glass Condensate (CGC) formalism. We predict large rates, implying that
the experimental identification could be feasible at the LHC.
"
Is there a method to solve the Diophantine equation $ax-by=c$ in the set of natural numbers?,"  In this paper one shows if the number of natural solutions of a general
linear equation is limited or not. Also, it is presented a method of solving
the Diophantine equation $ax-by=c$ in the set of natural numbers, and an
example of solving in $N$ a Diophantine equation with three variables.
"
What are the properties of the Bell states in the absence of interactions?,"  The four Bell states can be represented by separable coherent states which
are products of individual non-hermitian spin operators. In the absence of
interactions, the non-hermitian states are predicted to form a new quantum
state of spin magnitude 1/sqrt(2) rather than 1/2. Properties of these states
show that an isolated spin is a resonance state with zero net angular momentum,
consistent with a point particle. In addition, the Bell states are shown to
take on the identical mathematical form when the two spins are bound (local) or
unbound (non-local). The bound Bell states are resonances between four states.
When the separate, they do so from only one of its resonance states and their
ensemble average defines the unbound Bell states. The bound and unbound Bell
states have the same mathematical form due to the persistence of the
rotationally invariance of sigma(1)dot sigma(2).
"
What is the source of error in a quantum computer due to a coherent shift?,"  Even in the absence of external influences the operability of a quantum
computer (QC) is not guaranteed because of the effects of residual one- and
two-body imperfections. Here we investigate how these internal flaws affect the
performance of a quantum controlled-NOT (CNOT) gate in an isolated flawed QC.
First we find that the performance of the CNOT gate is considerably better when
the two-body imperfections are strong. Secondly, we find that the largest
source of error is due to a coherent shift rather than decoherence or
dissipation. Our results suggest that the problem of internal imperfections
should be given much more attention in designing scalable QC architectures.
"
Can the topological approach of the problem be used to detect chaotic-like dynamics in maps defined on sets homeomorphic to rectangles?,"  In this paper we propose an elementary topological approach which unifies and
extends various different results concerning fixed points and periodic points
for maps defined on sets homeomorphic to rectangles embedded in euclidean
spaces. We also investigate the associated discrete semidynamical systems in
view of detecting the presence of chaotic-like dynamics.

What are the limitations on separability of states in GHZ family?,"  We employ conditional Tsallis q entropies to study the separability of
symmetric one parameter W and GHZ multiqubit mixed states. The strongest
limitation on separability is realized in the limit q-->infinity, and is found
to be much superior to the condition obtained using the von Neumann conditional
entropy (q=1 case). Except for the example of two qubit and three qubit
symmetric states of GHZ family, the $q$-conditional entropy method leads to
sufficient - but not necessary - conditions on separability.
"
What is the concept of local derivations in a C$^*$-algebra?,"  Let $A$ be a C$^*$-algebra, and let $X$ be a Banach $A$-bimodule. B. E.
Johnson showed that local derivations from $A$ into $X$ are derivations. We
extend this concept of locality to the higher cohomology of a $C^*$-algebra
%for $n$-cocycles from $A^{(n)}$ into $X$ and show that, for every $n\in \N$,
bounded local $n$-cocycles from $A^{(n)}$ into $X$ are $n$-cocycles.
"
How to determine fiber coupling efficiencies from experimentally measurable quantities?,"  We make a thorough analysis of heralded single photon sources regarding how
factors such as the detector gate-period, the photon rates, the fiber coupling
efficiencies, and the system losses affect the performance of the source. In
the course of this we give a detailed description of how to determine fiber
coupling efficiencies from experimentally measurable quantities. We show that
asynchronous sources perform, under most conditions, better than synchronous
sources with respect to multiphoton events, but only for nearly perfect
coupling efficiencies. We apply the theory to an asynchronous source of
heralded single photons based on spontaneous parametric downconversion in a
periodically poled, bulk, KTiOPO4 crystal. The source generates light with
highly non-degenerate wavelengths of 810 nm and 1550 nm, where the 810 nm
photons are used to announce the presence of the 1550 nm photons inside a
single-mode optical fiber. For our setup we find the probability of having a
1550 nm photon present in the single-mode fiber, as announced by the 810 nm
photon, to be 48%. The probability of multiphoton events is strongly suppressed
compared to a Poissonian light source, giving highly sub-Poisson photon
statistics.
"
What is the relationship between the dark matter scattering cross section and the rate of energy deposition by dark matter self-annihilation products?,"  We point out a new and largely model-independent constraint on the dark
matter scattering cross section with nucleons, applying when this quantity is
larger than for typical weakly interacting dark matter candidates. When the
dark matter capture rate in Earth is efficient, the rate of energy deposition
by dark matter self-annihilation products would grossly exceed the measured
heat flow of Earth. This improves the spin-independent cross section
constraints by many orders of magnitude, and closes the window between
astrophysical constraints (at very large cross sections) and underground
detector constraints (at small cross sections). In the applicable mass range,
from about 1 to about 10^{10} GeV, the scattering cross section of dark matter
with nucleons is then bounded from above by the latter constraints, and hence
must be truly weak, as usually assumed.
"
How is the new approach to detecting periodic orbits in high-dimensional systems more efficient than the previous methods?,"  An algorithm for detecting unstable periodic orbits in chaotic systems [Phys.
Rev. E, 60 (1999), pp. 6172-6175] which combines the set of stabilising
transformations proposed by Schmelcher and Diakonos [Phys. Rev. Lett., 78
(1997), pp. 4733-4736] with a modified semi-implicit Euler iterative scheme and
seeding with periodic orbits of neighbouring periods, has been shown to be
highly efficient when applied to low-dimensional system. The difficulty in
applying the algorithm to higher dimensional systems is mainly due to the fact
that the number of stabilising transformations grows extremely fast with
increasing system dimension. In this thesis, we construct stabilising
transformations based on the knowledge of the stability matrices of already
detected periodic orbits (used as seeds). The advantage of our approach is in a
substantial reduction of the number of transformations, which increases the
efficiency of the detection algorithm, especially in the case of
high-dimensional systems. The performance of the new approach is illustrated by
its application to the four-dimensional kicked double rotor map, a
six-dimensional system of three coupled H\'enon maps and to the
Kuramoto-Sivashinsky system in the weakly turbulent regime.

"How to obtain, compile, and execute the program and interpret the results?","  Recent calculations of collisionless, Case-B, He I emissivities were
performed by Bauman et al. (2005). The source code used in the calculation has
been freely available online since that paper was published. A number of
changes have been made to simplify the use of the code by third parties. Here I
provide details on how to obtain, compile, and execute the program and
interpret the results.
"
What is the relation between the vortex degrees of freedom and the component fields of the Kalb-Ramond superfield?,"  The main goal of this work is to investigate the possibility of finding the
supersymmetric version of the U(1)-global string model which behaves as a
vortex-superfluid. To describe the superfluid phase, we introduce a
Lorentz-symmetry breaking background that, in an approach based on
supersymmetry, leads to a discussion on the relation between the violation of
Lorentz symmetry and explicit soft supersymmetry breakings. We also study the
relation between the string configuration and the vortex-superfluid phase. In
the framework we settle down in terms of superspace and superfields, we
actually establish a duality between the vortex degrees of freedom and the
component fields of the Kalb-Ramond superfield. We make also considerations
about the fermionic excitations that may appear in connection with the vortex
formation.
"
What is the notion of abstract Boehm tree related to the evaluation mechanism of computing?,"  The notion of abstract Boehm tree has arisen as an operationally-oriented
distillation of works on game semantics, and has been investigated in two
papers. This paper revisits the notion, providing more syntactic support and
more examples (like call-by-value evaluation) illustrating the generality of
the underlying computing device. Precise correspondences between various
formulations of the evaluation mechanism of abstract Boehm trees are
established.
"
What are the implications of unconditional secure reusable base string for the privacy amplification in quantum key distribution protocols?,"  Protecting secure random key from eavesdropping in quantum key distribution
protocols has been well developed. In this letter, we further study how to
detect and eliminate eavesdropping on the random base string in such protocols.
The correlation between the base string and the key enables Alice and Bob to
use specific privacy amplification to distill and reuse the previously shared
base string with unconditional security and high efficiency. The analysis of
the unconditional secure reusable base string brings about new concept and
protocol design technique.
"
"What is the probability that a random polynomial has no real root in the interval [0,1]?","  We consider a class of real random polynomials, indexed by an integer d, of
large degree n and focus on the number of real roots of such random
polynomials. The probability that such polynomials have no real root in the
interval [0,1] decays as a power law n^{-\theta(d)} where \theta(d)>0 is the
exponent associated to the decay of the persistence probability for the
diffusion equation with random initial conditions in space dimension d. For n
even, the probability that such polynomials have no root on the full real axis
decays as n^{-2(\theta(d) + \theta(2))}. For d=1, this connection allows for a
physical realization of real random polynomials. We further show that the
probability that such polynomials have exactly k real roots in [0,1] has an
unusual scaling form given by n^{-\tilde \phi(k/\log n)} where \tilde \phi(x)
is a universal large deviation function.
"
collisions?,"  The exclusive reaction of rho meson pair electroproduction in gamma*gamma*
collisions is a nice place to study various dynamics and factorization
properties in the perturbative sector of QCD. At low energy (quarks dominance),
this process can be considered as a way to explore QCD factorizations involving
generalized distribution amplitudes (GDA) and transition distribution
amplitudes (TDA), and, in the Regge limit of QCD (gluons dominance), it seems
to offer a promising probe of the BFKL resummation effects which could be
studied at the next international linear collider (ILC).

What is the relationship between the base string and the key in quantum key distribution protocols?,"  Protecting secure random key from eavesdropping in quantum key distribution
protocols has been well developed. In this letter, we further study how to
detect and eliminate eavesdropping on the random base string in such protocols.
The correlation between the base string and the key enables Alice and Bob to
use specific privacy amplification to distill and reuse the previously shared

"
What are the implications of the 6049 MHz OH maser line for the detection of supernova remnants and molecular clouds?,"  OH masers at 1720 MHz have proven to be excellent indicators of interactions
between supernova remnants and molecular clouds. Recent calculations suggest
that the 6049 MHz OH maser line is excited for higher column densities than for
the 1720 MHz line. It is therefore a potentially valuable indicator of
remnant-cloud interaction.
  We present preliminary results of a survey using the Parkes Methanol
Multibeam receiver for 6049 MHz and 6035/6030 MHz OH masers towards 36
supernova remnants and 4 fields in the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds. While
no 6049 MHz masers have been found, three new sites of 6035 and 6030 MHz OH
maser emission have been discovered in star-forming regions.
"
What are the irreducible factors of a polynomial $P$?,"  For any polynomial $P \in \mathbb{C}[X_1,X_2,...,X_n]$, we describe a
$\mathbb{C}$-vector space $F(P)$ of solutions of a linear system of equations
coming from some algebraic partial differential equations such that the
dimension of $F(P)$ is the number of irreducible factors of $P$. Moreover, the
knowledge of $F(P)$ gives a complete factorization of the polynomial $P$ by
taking gcd's. This generalizes previous results by Ruppert and Gao in the case
$n=2$.
"
What is the supersymmetric Hamiltonian used to describe the edge excitations of the Moore-Read state?,"  A supersymmetric Hamiltonian is constructed for the edge excitations of the
Moore-Read (Pfaffian) like state, which is a realization of the N=2
supersymmetric CS model. Fermionic generators and their conjugates are
introduced to deal with the fermion pairing, whose condensation form a BCS like
state. After Bogoliubov transformation, a N=2 supersymmetric and
nonrelativistic Hamiltonian is found to take a known form, which is integrable.
The main difference between the Moore-Read state and our BCS like state is that
the number of fermion pairs in our formalism is not fixed. However, we have
also found that the excited states in our model looks similar but not exactly
the same as Moore and Read's.
"
What are the implications of unresolved binary white dwarfs for the optical and UV temperatures of white dwarfs?,"  We present a comparative study of effective temperatures determined from the
hydrogen Balmer lines and from the UV energy distribution for 140 DA white
dwarfs drawn from the IUE archive. Our results indicate that the optical and UV
temperatures of the majority of stars below T~40,000 K and within ~75 pc are in
fairly good agreement given the uncertainties. At higher temperatures and/or
larger distances, however, significant discrepancies are observed. Several
mechanisms are investigated to account for these discrepancies including the
effect of interstellar reddening, the presence of metals in the photosphere,
and the existence of unresolved binary white dwarfs. The results of our
analysis reveal that wavelength-dependent extinction is the most natural
explanation for the observed temperature differences. We also attempt to
predict the differences in optical and UV temperatures expected from unresolved
degenerate binaries by performing an exhaustive simulation of composite model
spectra. In light of these simulations, we then discuss some known double
degenerates and identify new binary candidates by restricting our analysis to
stars located within 75 pc where the effect of interstellar reddening is
significantly reduced.
"
What are the key concepts in a general-purpose computing on a semantic,"  In this work we solve exactly a class of three-body propagators for the most
general quadratic interactions in the coordinates, for arbitrary masses and
couplings. This is done both for the constant as the time-dependent couplings
and masses, by using the Feynman path integral formalism. Finally the energy
spectrum and the eigenfunctions are recovered from the propagators.
"
What is the analogy between the invasive behavior of a tumor and the mechanical insertion of a solid inclusion in an elastic material?,"  Invasiveness, one of the hallmarks of tumor progression, represents the
tumor's ability to expand into the host tissue by means of several complex
biochemical and biomechanical processes. Since certain aspects of the problem
present a striking resemblance with well known physical mechanisms, such as the
mechanical insertion of a solid inclusion in an elastic material specimen [1,
2] or a water drop impinging on a surface [3], we propose here an analogy
between these physical processes and a cancer system's invasive branching into
the surrounding tissue. Accounting for its solid and viscous properties, we
present a unifying concept that the tumor behaves as a granular solid. While
our model has been explicitly formulated for multicellular tumor spheroids in
vitro, it should also contribute to a better understanding of tumor invasion in
vivo.
"
What are the implications of a second explosion in supernovae ejecta?,"  The most luminous Supernova SN2006gy (more than a 100 times brighter than a
typical supernova) has been a challenge to explain by standard models. For
example, pair instability supernovae which are luminous enough seem to have too
slow a rise, and core collapse supernovae do not seem to be luminous enough. We
present an alternative scenario involving the quark-nova phenomenon (an
explosive transition of the newly born neutron star to a quark star) in which a
second explosion (delayed) occurs inside the ejecta of a normal supernova. The
reheated supernova ejecta can radiate at higher levels for longer periods of
time primarily due to reduced adiabatic expansion losses, unlike the standard
supernova case. We find an encouraging match between the resulting lightcurve
and that observed in the case of SN2006gy suggesting that we might have at hand
the first ever signature of a quark-nova. Successful application of our model
to SN2005gj and SN2005ap is also presented.
"
What are the physical phases of core evolution that lead to the formation of stars?,"  The similarity between the mass and spatial distributions of pre-stellar gas
cores in star-forming clouds and young stars in clusters provides strong
circumstantial evidence that these gas cores are the direct progenitors of
individual stars. Here I describe a physical model for the evolution of massive
cores into stars, starting with the initial phases of collapse and
fragmentation, through disk formation and fragmentation, the later phases of
stellar feedback, and finally interaction of the newly formed stars with their
environments. This model shows that a direct mapping from cores to stars is the
natural physical outcome of massive core evolution, and thereby allows us to
explain many of the properties of young star clusters as direct imprints of
their gas-phase progenitors.
"
What is the problem of optimal multiple switching in finite horizon?,"  We consider the problem of optimal multiple switching in finite horizon, when
the state of the system, including the switching costs, is a general adapted
stochastic process. The problem is formulated as an extended impulse control
problem and completely solved using probabilistic tools such as the Snell
envelop of processes and reflected backward stochastic differential equations.
Finally, when the state of the system is a Markov diffusion process, we show
that the vector of value functions of the optimal problem is a viscosity
solution to a system of variational inequalities with inter-connected
obstacles.
"
What is the definition of a Jones pair in the context of braid group representations?,"  Motivated by Jones' braid group representations constructed from spin models,
we define {\sl a Jones pair} to be a pair of $\nbyn$ matrices $(A,B)$ such that
the endomorphisms $X_A$ and $\D_B$ form a representation of a braid group. When
$A$ and $B$ are type-II matrices, we call $(A,B)$ {\sl an invertible Jones
pair}. We develop the theory of Jones pairs in this thesis.
  Our aim is to study the connections among association schemes, spin models
and four-weight spin models using the viewpoint of Jones pairs. We use Nomura's
method to construct a pair of algebras from the matrices $(A,B)$, which we call
the Nomura algebras of $(A,B)$. These algebras become the central tool in this
thesis. We explore their properties in Chapters \ref{Nomura} and \ref{IINom}.
  In Chapter \ref{JP}, we introduce Jones pairs. We prove the equivalence of
four-weight spin models and invertible Jones pairs. We extend some existing
concepts for four-weight spin models to Jones pairs. In Chapter
\ref{SpinModels}, we provide new proofs for some well-known results on the
Bose-Mesner algebras associated with spin models.
  We document the main results of the thesis in Chapter \ref{InvJP}. We prove
that every four-weight spin model comes from a symmetric spin model (up to
odd-gauge equivalence). We present four Bose-Mesner algebras associated to each
four-weight spin model. We study the relations among these algebras. In
particular, we provide a strategy to search for four-weight spin models. This
strategy is analogous to the method given by Bannai, Bannai and Jaeger for
finding spin models.
"
How do the clustering properties of AGNs around clusters compare to those of galaxies?,"  X-ray surveys facilitate investigations of the environment of AGNs. Deep
Chandra observations revealed that the AGNs source surface density rises near
clusters of galaxies. The natural extension of these works is the measurement
of spatial clustering of AGNs around clusters and the investigation of relative
biasing between active galactic nuclei and galaxies near clusters.The major
aims of this work are to obtain a measurement of the correlation length of AGNs
around clusters and a measure of the averaged clustering properties of a
complete sample of AGNs in dense environments. We present the first measurement
of the soft X-ray cluster-AGN cross-correlation function in redshift space
using the data of the ROSAT-NEP survey. The survey covers 9x9 deg^2 around the
North Ecliptic Pole where 442 X-ray sources were detected and almost completely
spectroscopically identified. We detected a >3sigma significant clustering
signal on scales s<50 h70^-1 Mpc. We performed a classical maximum-likelihood
power-law fit to the data and obtained a correlation length s_0=8.7+1.2-0.3
h_70-1 Mpc and a slope gamma=1.7$^+0.2_-0.7 (1sigma errors). This is a strong
evidence that AGNs are good tracers of the large scale structure of the
Universe. Our data were compared to the results obtained by cross-correlating
X-ray clusters and galaxies. We observe, with a large uncertainty, that the
bias factor of AGN is similar to that of galaxies.
"
What are the key parameters that determine the evolution and acceleration efficiency of cosmic rays in a CRASH code simulation?,"  Using an improved version of the previously introduced CRASH (Cosmic Ray
Acceleration SHock) code, we have calculated the time evolution of cosmic-ray
(CR) modified quasi-parallel plane shocks for Bohm-like diffusion, including
self-consistent models of Alfven wave drift and dissipation, along with thermal
leakage injection of CRs. The new simulations follow evolution of the CR
distribution to much higher energies than our previous study, providing a
better examination of evolutionary and asymptotic behaviors. The postshock CR
pressure becomes constant after quick initial adjustment, since the evolution
of the CR partial pressure expressed in terms of a momentum similarity variable
is self-similar. The shock precursor, which scales as the diffusion length of
the highest energy CRs, subsequently broadens approximately linearly with time,
independent of diffusion model, so long as CRs continue to be accelerated to
ever-higher energies. This means the nonlinear shock structure can be described
approximately in terms of the similarity variable, x/(u_s t), where u_s is the
shock speed once the postshock pressure reaches an approximate time asymptotic
state. As before, the shock Mach number is the key parameter determining the
evolution and the CR acceleration efficiency, although finite Alfven wave drift
and wave energy dissipation in the shock precursor reduce the effective
velocity change experienced by CRs, so reduce acceleration efficiency
noticeably, thus, providing a second important parameter at low and moderate
Mach numbers.
"
What is the significance of the Fifth Data Release (DR5) of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)?,"  This paper describes the Fifth Data Release (DR5) of the Sloan Digital Sky
Survey (SDSS). DR5 includes all survey quality data taken through June 2005 and
represents the completion of the SDSS-I project (whose successor, SDSS-II will
continue through mid-2008). It includes five-band photometric data for 217
million objects selected over 8000 square degrees, and 1,048,960 spectra of
galaxies, quasars, and stars selected from 5713 square degrees of that imaging
data. These numbers represent a roughly 20% increment over those of the Fourth
Data Release; all the data from previous data releases are included in the
present release. In addition to ""standard"" SDSS observations, DR5 includes
repeat scans of the southern equatorial stripe, imaging scans across M31 and
the core of the Perseus cluster of galaxies, and the first spectroscopic data
from SEGUE, a survey to explore the kinematics and chemical evolution of the
Galaxy. The catalog database incorporates several new features, including
photometric redshifts of galaxies, tables of matched objects in overlap regions
of the imaging survey, and tools that allow precise computations of survey
geometry for statistical investigations.
"
What are the symmetries of the group S_{k+2} acting on the set P^k?,"  We consider complex dynamics of a critically finite holomorphic map from P^k
to P^k, which has symmetries associated with the symmetric group S_{k+2} acting
on P^k, for each k \ge 1. The Fatou set of each map of this family consists of
attractive basins of superattracting points. Each map of this family satisfies
Axiom A.
"
"What are the implications of the accuracy of semiclassical approximations for small times, and their limitations for large times?","  We study solutions of the time dependent Schr\""odinger equation on Riemannian
manifolds with oscillatory initial conditions given by Lagrangian states.
Semiclassical approximations describe these solutions for small h (where h is
the semiclassical parameter), but their accuracy for large times is in general
only understood up to the Ehrenfest time T ~ ln(1/h), and the most difficult
case is the one where the underlying classical system is chaotic.
  We show that on surfaces of constant negative curvature semiclassical
approximations remain accurate for times at least up to T ~ h^(-1/2) in the
case that the Lagrangian state is associated with an unstable manifold of the
geodesic flow.
"
What is the impact of the baryon correction on the frequency of multiple images in lensed quasars?,"  The statistics of giant arcs and large separation lensed quasars provide
powerful constraints for the parameters of the underlying cosmological model.
So far, most investigations have been carried out using pure dark matter
simulations. Here we present a recipe for including the effects of baryon
cooling (i.e. large galaxy formation) in dark matter N-body simulations that is
consistent with observations of massive galaxies. Then we quantitatively
compare lensing with and without applying this baryon correction to the pure
dark matter case. Including the baryon correction significantly increases the
frequency of giant arcs and lensed quasars, particularly on scales of 10 arcsec
and smaller: the overall frequency of multiple images increases by about 25%
for source redshifts between z_s = 1.5 and 7.5 and splittings larger than about
3 arcsec. The baryon rearrangement also slightly increases the fraction of
quadruple images over doubles.
"
What is the path integral representation of the probability density function for the position of the particles?,"  We perform a time-dependent study of the driven dynamics of overdamped
particles which are placed in a one-dimensional, piecewise linear random
potential. This set-up of spatially quenched disorder then exerts a dichotomous
varying random force on the particles. We derive the path integral
representation of the resulting probability density function for the position
of the particles and transform this quantity of interest into the form of a
Fourier integral. In doing so, the evolution of the probability density can be
investigated analytically for finite times. It is demonstrated that the
probability density contains both a $\delta$-singular contribution and a
regular part. While the former part plays a dominant role at short times, the
latter rules the behavior at large evolution times. The slow approach of the
probability density to a limiting Gaussian form as time tends to infinity is
elucidated in detail.
"
What are the form factors $f_+^{B\to \eta}(q^2)$ and $f_+^{B\to \eta'}(q^2)$ in QCD?,"  We calculate the semileptonic form factors $f_+^{B\to \eta}(q^2)$ and
$f_+^{B\to \eta'}(q^2)$ from QCD sum rules on the light-cone (LCSRs), to NLO in
QCD, and for small to moderate q^2, $0\leq q^2\leq 16 {\rm
  GeV}^2$. We include in particular the so-called singlet contribution, i.e.\
weak annihilation of the B meson with the emission of two gluons which, thanks
to the U(1)$_{\rm A}$ anomaly, couple directly to $\etap$. This effect is
included to leading-twist accuracy. This contribution has been neglected in
previous calculations of the form factors from LCSRs. We find that the singlet
contribution to $f_+^{B\to \eta'}$ can be up to 20%, while that to $f_+^{B\to
\eta}$ is, as expected, much smaller and below 3%. We also suggest to measure
the ratio ${\cal B}(B\to\eta' e \nu)/{\cal
  B}(B\to \eta e \nu)$ to better constrain the size of the singlet
contribution.
"
What are the implications of the two isomorphic triangles in the Verdier category?,"  We show by an example that in a Verdier triangulated category, there may
exist two mutually nonisomorphic Verdier octahedra containing the same
commutative triangle.
"
What is the effect of resonance scattering on X-ray line profiles in the pair?,"  We present XMM-Newton Reflection Grating Spectrometer observations of pairs
of X-ray emission line profiles from the O star Zeta Pup that originate from
the same He-like ion. The two profiles in each pair have different shapes and
cannot both be consistently fit by models assuming the same wind parameters. We
show that the differences in profile shape can be accounted for in a model
including the effects of resonance scattering, which affects the resonance line
in the pair but not the intercombination line. This implies that resonance
scattering is also important in single resonance lines, where its effect is
difficult to distinguish from a low effective continuum optical depth in the
wind. Thus, resonance scattering may help reconcile X-ray line profile shapes
with literature mass-loss rates.
"
What is the diagnostic value of polarimetric observations for the FeH F^4 Delta-X^4 Delta system in studying solar and stellar magnetic fields?,"  Lines of diatomic molecules are more temperature and pressure sensitive than
atomic lines, which makes them ideal tools for studying cool stellar
atmospheres an internal structure of sunspots and starspots. The FeH F^4
Delta-X^4 Delta system represents such an example that exhibits in addition a
large magnetic field sensitivity. The current theoretical descriptions of these
transitions including the molecular constants involved are only based on
intensity measurements because polarimetric observations have not been
available so far, which limits their diagnostic value. We present for the first
time spectropolarimetric observations of the FeH F^4 Delta-X^4 Delta system
measured in sunspots to investigate their diagnostic capabilities for probing
solar and stellar magnetic fields. We investigate whether the current
theoretical model of FeH can reproduce the observed Stokes profiles including
their magnetic properties. The polarimetric observations are compared with
synthetic Stokes profiles modeled with radiative transfer calculations. This
allows us to infer the temperature and the magnetic field strength of the
observed sunspots. We find that the current theory successfully reproduces the
magnetic properties of a large number of lines in the FeH F^4 Delta-X^4 Delta
system. In a few cases the observations indicate a larger Zeeman splitting than
predicted by the theory. There, our observations have provided additional
constraints, which allowed us to determine empirical molecular constants. The
FeH F^4 Delta-X^4 Delta system is found to be a very sensitive magnetic
diagnostic tool. Polarimetric data of these lines provide us with more direct
information to study the coolest parts of astrophysical objects.
"
What is the shape of the galaxy luminosity functions at the bright end in the Coma cluster?,"  We present the first results of a Spitzer IRAC (Infrared Array Camera)
wide-field survey of the Coma cluster. The observations cover two fields of
different galaxy densities; the first is a 0.733 deg^2 region in the core of
the cluster (Coma 1), the second a 0.555 deg^2 off-center region located ~57
arcmin (1.7 Mpc) south-west from the core (Coma 3). The observations, although
short 70-90 s exposures, are very sensitive; we detect ~29,200 sources at 3.6
micron over the total ~1.3 deg^2 survey area. We construct 3.6 micron galaxy
luminosity functions (LFs) for each field using selection functions based on
spectroscopic redshifts. At the bright end, the LFs are well modeled by a
traditional Schechter function; [M^star (3.6 micron), alpha_1] = [-25.17,
-1.18] and [-24.69, -1.30] for Coma 1 and Coma 3 respectively. However, at the
faint end (M(3.6 micron) > -20.5), there is a steep increase in the LF slope in
both fields indicative of large numbers of red dwarf galaxies. The reality of
this population is examined using optical counterparts in SDSS data with
optical color filtering (g-r<1.3). The steep increase can be modeled with a
power-law function, with slopes of alpha_2 = -2.18 (Coma 1) and alpha_2 = -2.60
(Coma 3). A qualitative comparison with optical (B- and R-band) LFs shows that
we are likely to be observing a larger population of dwarf galaxies in the
near-IR, which may be a low-surface-brightness (LSB) population that IRAC is
particularly sensitive to, or a population too red to be detected in existing
optical surveys down to R~20.
"
What are the implications of the localized nonlinear surface states at the interface?,"  We report on the experimental observation of two-dimensional surface waves
localized at the edge or in the corner of femtosecond laser-written waveguide
arrays in fused silica. Increasing the power of the input beam allows one to
observe a clear transition from a linear diffraction pattern to localized
nonlinear surface states, which can exist at the interface only above a certain
power threshold.
"
What are the effects of the subsequent highly non-linear motion of cluster and Ar environment?,"  We investigate the dynamical evolution of a Na$_8$ cluster embedded in Ar
matrices of various sizes from N=30 to 1048. The system is excited by an
intense short laser pulse leading to high ionization stages. We analyze the
subsequent highly non-linear motion of cluster and Ar environment in terms of
trajectories, shapes, and energy flow. The most prominent effects are:
temporary stabilization of high charge states for several ps, sudden stopping
of the Coulomb explosion of the embedded Na$_8$ clusters associated with an
extremely fast energy transfer to the Ar matrix, fast distribution of energy
throughout the Ar layers by a sound wave. Other ionic-atomic transfer and
relaxation processes proceed at slower scale of few ps. The electron cloud is
almost thermally decoupled from ions and thermalizes far beyond the ps scale.
"
What is the impact of the electric dipole charge on the angular correlation between the alpha particle and the emitted photon?,"  A high-statistics measurement of bremsstrahlung emitted in the alpha decay of
210Po has been performed, which allows to follow the photon spectra up to
energies of ~ 500 keV. The measured differential emission probability is in
good agreement with our theoretical results obtained within the quasi classical
approximation as well as with the exact quantum mechanical calculation. It is
shown that due to the small effective electric dipole charge of the radiating
system a significant interference between the electric dipole and quadrupole
contributions occurs, which is altering substantially the angular correlation
between the alpha particle and the emitted photon.
"
What are the optical properties of Erbium doped glasses with varying compositions?,"  A new class of Erbium doped glasses with compositions xNa2O - (60-x)PbCl2 -
40P2O5 (x=0, 10, 20 and 30) were fabricated and characterized for optical
properties. Absorption spectra were analyzed for important Judd-Ofelt
parameters from the integrated intensities of various Er3+ glass absorption
bands. Photoluminescence (PL) and its decay behavior studies were carried out
for the transition 4I13/2 -> 4I15/2. A systematic correlation between the
Judd-Ofelt parameter {omega}2 and the covalent nature of the glass matrix was
observed, due to increased role of bridging oxygens in the glass network. The
PL broadness and life times of 4I13/2_> 4I15/2 transition were typically in the
range of 40-60nm and 2.13-2.5ms respectively. These glasses broadly showed high
transparency, high refractive index, shorter life times and, most importantly,
these glasses were found to be capable of being doped with larger
concentrations of Er3+ (up to 4 wt%). Increase of Er3+ concentration resulted
in the increase in PL line-widths with no significant effect of concentration
quenching, indicating that these glasses are suitable for optical
fibre/waveguide amplifiers.
"
What are the properties of the invariant cone for the toral automorphisms?,"  We consider pairs of toral automorphisms (A,B) satisfying an invariant cone
property. At each iteration, A acts with probability p and B with probability
1-p. We prove exponential decay of correlations for a class of Holder
continuous observables.
"
What are the evolutionary behaviors of magnetars that are inferred from the field derived from a magnetized core?,"  We explore the possibility that a magnetar may owe its strong magnetic field
to a magnetized core which, as indicated by certain equations of state, may
form due to phase transitions at high density mediated by strong interaction
within a sufficiently massive neutron star. We argue that the field derived
from such a core could explain several inferred evolutionary behaviors of
magnetars.
"
What is the importance of considering both electron- and neutrino-unparticle couplings?,"  Following Georgi's unparticle scheme, we examine the effective couplings
between neutrinos and unparticle operators. As an immediate consequence,
neutrinos become unstable and can decay into the unparticle stuff. Assuming the
dimension transmutation scale is around $\Lambda^{}_{\cal U} \sim 1 ~{\rm
TeV}$, we implement the cosmological limit on the neutrino lifetime to
constrain the neutrino-unparticle couplings for different scaling dimensions
$d$. In addition, provided that the electron-unparticle coupling is restricted
due to the precise measurement of the anomalous magnetic moment of electron, we
calculate the unparticle contribution to the neutrino-electron elastic
scattering. It is more important to jointly deal with the couplings of the
unparticle to the standard model particles rather than separately. Taking into
account both electron- and neutrino-unparticle couplings, we find that the
scaling dimension of the scalar unparticle should lie in the narrow range $1 <
d < 2$ by requiring the observables to be physically meaningful. However, there
is no consistent range of $d$ for the vector unparticle operator.
"
"What is the effective Einstein equation on the brane, and what is its right-hand side?","  We consider a brane world in an arbitrary number of dimensions without Z_2
symmetry and derive the effective Einstein equation on the brane, where its
right-hand side is given by the matter on the brane and the curvature in the
bulk. This is achieved by first deriving the junction conditions for a non-Z_2
symmetric brane and second solving the Gauss equation, which relates the mean
extrinsic curvature of the brane to the curvature in the bulk, with respect to
the mean extrinsic curvature. The latter corresponds to formulating an explicit
junction condition on the mean of the extrinsic curvature, analogue to the
Israel junction condition for the jump of the extrinsic curvature. We find that
there appears a new type of an effective anisotropic fluid on the right-hand
side of the effective Einstein equation due to the fact that there is no Z_2
symmetry. The derived equation is a basic equation for the study of
Kaluza-Klein brane worlds in which some dimensions on the brane are
compactified or for a regularization scheme for a higher codimension brane
world, where the Kaluza-Klein compactification on the brane is regarded as a
means to regularize the uncontrollable spacetime singularity caused by the
higher codimension brane.
"
What is the nature of the sources detected at 610 MHz?,"  We present the results of a deep 610 MHz survey of the 1^H XMM/Chandra survey
area with the GMRT. The resulting maps have a resolution of ~7 arcsec and an
rms noise limit of 60 microJy. To a 5 sigma detection limit of 300 microJy we
detect 223 sources within a survey area of diameter 64 arcmin. We compute the
610 MHz source counts and compare them to those measured at other radio
wavelengths. The well know flattening of the Euclidean-normalised 1.4 GHz
source counts below ~2 mJy, usually explained by a population of starburst
galaxies undergoing luminosity evolution, is seen at 610 MHz. The 610 MHz
source counts can be modelled by the same populations that explain the 1.4 GHz
source counts, assuming a spectral index of -0.7 for the starburst galaxies and
the steep spectrum AGN population. We find a similar dependence of luminosity
evolution on redshift for the starburst galaxies at 610 MHz as is found at 1.4
GHz (i.e. 'Q'= 2.45 (+0.3,-0.4)).
"
What is the novel concept of expander relations in the context of relational structures?,"  We give a poly-time construction for a combinatorial classic known as Sparse
Incomparability Lemma, studied by Erdos, Lovasz, Nesetril, Rodl and others: We
show that every Constraint Satisfaction Problem is poly-time equivalent to its
restriction to structures with large girth. This implies that the complexity
classes CSP and Monotone Monadic Strict NP introduced by Feder and Vardi are
computationally equivalent. The technical novelty of the paper is a concept of
expander relations and a new type of product for relational structures: a
generalization of the zig-zag product, the twisted product.
"
What is the method proposed to determine the mass and width differences of the two D meson mass-eigenstates as well as the CP violating parameters associated with D^0-\bar{D}^0 mixing?,"  We propose a new method to determine the mass and width differences of the
two D meson mass-eigenstates as well as the CP violating parameters associated
with D^0-\bar{D}^0 mixing. We show that an accurate measurement of all the
mixing parameters is possible for an arbitrary CP violating phase, by combining
observables from a time dependent study of D decays to a doubly Cabibbo
suppressed mode with information from a CP eigenstate. As an example we
consider D^0-> K^{*0} \pi^0 decays where the K^{*0} is reconstructed in both
K^+\pi^- and K_S\pi^0. We also show that decays to the CP eigenstate D-> K^+K^-
together with D-> K^+\pi^- can be used to extract all the mixing parameters. A
combined analysis using D^0-> K^{*0} \pi^0 and D-> K^+K^- can also be used to
reduce the ambiguity in the determination of parameters.
"
What is the apparent distance modulus and mean reddening of the cluster NGC 752?,"  New photoelectric seven-color observations in the Vilnius system are
presented for 65 stars in the region of the open cluster NGC 752. Based on
individual stars with accurate photometric classifications, we determine the
apparent distance modulus (m-M)=8.38 and the mean reddening to the cluster
E(Y-V)=0.027, or E(B-V)=0.034. The mean photometric metallicity for the
main-sequence stars, [Fe/H]=-0.14, is found to be slightly lower than that
derived for the red clump giants, [Fe/H]=-0.08. This difference suggests that
red giants in later evolutionary phases may not have zero-age surface values of
[Fe/H]. We made use of the least-squares minimization techniques to fit the
Padova theoretical isochrones to the CMD, when the binary star population is
taken into account. By varying the distance modulus, metallicity and age, the
best match has been found between the seven magnitudes and colors of the
observed stars and those of model binaries, which gives the distance modulus by
0.2 mag smaller than that derived from individual stars, i.e., (m-M)=8.18, a
closely similar metallicity ([Fe/H]=-0.12), and age of 1.6 Gyr. With these
results, the fraction of photometric binaries among the main-sequence stars is
~40%.
"
What is the lower bound of the Hilbert-Kunz multiplicity of a non-regular ring?,"  Let $(R,\m)$ be a formally unmixed local ring of positive prime
characteristic and dimension $d$. We examine the implications of having small
Hilbert-Kunz multiplicity (i.e., close to 1). In particular, we show that if
$R$ is not regular, there exists a lower bound, strictly greater than one,
depending only on $d$, for its Hilbert-Kunz multiplicity.
"
What are the main implications of Finsler-Lagrange geometry for modern physics?,"  In this article, we review the current status of Finsler-Lagrange geometry
and generalizations. The goal is to aid non-experts on Finsler spaces, but
physicists and geometers skilled in general relativity and particle theories,
to understand the crucial importance of such geometric methods for applications
in modern physics. We also would like to orient mathematicians working in
generalized Finsler and Kahler geometry and geometric mechanics how they could
perform their results in order to be accepted by the community ''orthodox''
physicists. Although the bulk of former models of Finsler-Lagrange spaces where
elaborated on tangent bundles, the surprising result advocated in our works is
that such locally anisotropic structures can be modelled equivalently on
Riemann-Cartan spaces, even as exact solutions in Einstein and/or string
gravity, if nonholonomic distributions and moving frames of references are
introduced into consideration. We also propose a canonical scheme when
geometrical objects on a (pseudo) Riemannian space are nonholonomically
deformed into generalized Lagrange, or Finsler, configurations on the same
manifold or on a corresponding tangent bundle. Such canonical transforms are
defined by the coefficients of a prime metric (it can be a solution of the
Einstein equations) and generate target spaces as generalized Lagrange
structures, their models of almost Hermitian/ Kahler, or nonholonomic Riemann
spaces with constant curvature, for some Finsler like connections. There are
formulated the criteria when such constructions can be redefined equivalently
in terms of the Levi Civita connection.
"
What is the relationship between the Heisenberg model and the entanglement in quantum phase transitions?,"  We present a study of entanglement in the case of the 1D extended anisotropic
Heisenberg model. We investigate two quantum phase transitions (QPTs) within
the previously found ergodicity phase diagram [E. Plekhanov, A. Avella, and F.
Mancini Phys. Rev. B \textbf{74}, 115120 (2006)]. Our calculations are done by
means of the numerically exact Lanczos method at T=0, followed by a finite-size
scaling. As a measure of entanglement we use the concurrence for two spins out
of the system. We conclude from our studies that these QPTs are accompanied by
a qualitative entanglement change.
"
What is the expansion of the Universe in a braneworld cosmology?,"  In braneworld cosmology the expanding Universe is realized as a brane moving
through a warped higher-dimensional spacetime. Like a moving mirror causes the
creation of photons out of vacuum fluctuations, a moving brane leads to
graviton production. We show that, very generically, Kaluza-Klein (KK)
particles scale like stiff matter with the expansion of the Universe and can
therefore not represent the dark matter in a warped braneworld. We present
results for the production of massless and KK gravitons for bouncing branes in
five-dimensional anti de Sitter space. We find that for a realistic bounce the
back reaction from the generated gravitons will be most likely relevant. This
letter summarizes the main results and conclusions from numerical simulations
which are presented in detail in a long paper [M.Ruser and R. Durrer, Phys.
Rev. D 76, 104014 (2007), arXiv:0704.0790]
"
What are the states of a von Neumann algebra in the presheaf context?,"  In this fourth of our series of papers on observables we show that one can
associate to each von Neumann algebra R a pair of isomorphic presheaves, the
upper presheaf O^{+}_{R} and the lower presheaf O^{-}_{R}, on the category of
abelian von Neumann subalgebras of R. Each $A \in R_{sa}$ induces a global
section of O^{+}_{R} and of O^{-}_{R} respectively. We call them \emph
{contextual observables}. But we show that, in general, not every global
section of these presheaves arises in this way. Moreover, we discuss states of
a von Neumann algebra in the presheaf context.
"
"What are the ""resonant surface polariton modes"" in the context of an electromagnetic field interacting with a dispersive sphere?","  We study the interaction of an electromagnetic field with a non-absorbing or
absorbing dispersive sphere in the framework of complex angular momentum
techniques. We assume that the dielectric function of the sphere presents a
Drude-like behavior or an ionic crystal behavior modelling metallic and
semiconducting materials. We more particularly emphasize and interpret the
modifications induced in the resonance spectrum by absorption. We prove that
""resonant surface polariton modes"" are generated by a unique surface wave,
i.e., a surface (plasmon or phonon) polariton, propagating close to the sphere
surface. This surface polariton corresponds to a particular Regge pole of the
electric part (TM) of the S matrix of the sphere. From the associated Regge
trajectory we can construct semiclassically the spectrum of the complex
frequencies of the resonant surface polariton modes which can be considered as
Breit-Wigner-type resonances. Furthermore, by taking into account the Stokes
phenomenon, we derive an asymptotic expression for the position in the complex
angular momentum plane of the surface polariton Regge pole. We then describe
semiclassically the surface polariton and provide analytical expressions for
its dispersion relation and its damping in the non-absorbing and absorbing
cases. In these analytic expressions, we more particularly exhibit
well-isolated terms directly linked to absorption. Finally, we explain why the
photon-sphere system can be considered as an artificial atom (a ``plasmonic
atom"" or ""phononic atom"") and we briefly discuss the implication of our results
in the context of the Casimir effect.
"
What is the role of the Co ions in the transport properties of NdCoO3?,"  This study presents correlations between the structural and transport
properties of pure and doped neodymium cobaltate, a compound of great interest
for its foreseen applications as catalyst, sensor and thermoelectric material.
Neutron and x-ray powder diffraction data have been combined to carefully
determine lattice constants and atomic positions and four probe direct current
conductivity and thermoelectric power measurements allowed us to follow the
thermal evolution of the transport properties of these compounds. The dramatic
improvement of the room temperature conductivity of Nd0.8Ca0.2CoO3 with respect
to the pure and the Na-doped compound is explained in terms of a different
spin-state for the Co ions within this structure. The higher conductivity and
the absence of anomalies in the thermal expansion makes the Ca-doped compound
more attractive than the pure NdCoO3 in view of possible applications. The
experimental data and the Co environment analysis here discussed, in particular
bond lengths distortion and bending angles, are fully consistent with a spin
state (low to intermediate) transition in NdCoO3
"
What is the meaning of the usual formula in the case of vanishing mean?,"  This note extends Voiculescu's S-transform based analytical machinery for
free multiplicative convolution to the case where the mean of the probability
measures vanishes. We show that with the right interpretation of the
S-transform in the case of vanishing mean, the usual formula makes perfectly
good sense.
"
What is the conceptual model of econophysics?,"  The author solves two problems: formation of object of econophysics, creation
of the general theory of financial-economic monitoring. In the first problem he
studied two fundamental tasks: a choice of conceptual model and creation of
axiomatic base. It is accepted, that the conceptual model of econophysics is a
concrete definition of entropy conceptual model. Financial and economic
monitoring is considered as monitoring of flows on entropy manifold of phase
space - on a Diffusion field.
"
What is the method used to measure both the electron density and the magnetic field of the solar corona?,"  We present a novel experiment with the capacity to independently measure both
the electron density and the magnetic field of the solar corona. We achieve
this through measurement of the excess Faraday rotation due to propagation of
the polarised emission from a number of pulsars through the magnetic field of
the solar corona. This method yields independent measures of the integrated
electron density, via dispersion of the pulsed signal and the magnetic field,
via the amount of Faraday rotation. In principle this allows the determination
of the integrated magnetic field through the solar corona along many lines of
sight without any assumptions regarding the electron density distribution. We
present a detection of an increase in the rotation measure of the pulsar
J1801$-$2304 of approximately 160 \rad at an elongation of 0.95$^\circ$ from
the centre of the solar disk. This corresponds to a lower limit of the magnetic
field strength along this line of sight of $> 393\mu\mathrm{G}$. The lack of
precision in the integrated electron density measurement restricts this result
to a limit, but application of coronal plasma models can further constrain this
to approximately 20mG, along a path passing 2.5 solar radii from the solar
limb. Which is consistent with predictions obtained using extensions to the
Source Surface models published by Wilcox Solar Observatory
"
What are the physical and geometrical quantities expressed in terms of observable/measurable parameters?,"  The behavior of the angular velocity of a test particle moving in a stable
circular orbit in the vacuum on the brane is considered. In the brane world
scenario, the four dimensional effective Einstein equation acquire extra terms,
called dark radiation and dark pressure, respectively, which arise from the
embedding of the 3-brane in the bulk. A large number of independent
observations have shown that the rotational velocities of test particles
gravitating around galaxies tend, as a function of the distance from the
galactic center, toward constant values. By assuming a constant tangential
velocity, the general solution of the vacuum gravitational field equations on
the brane can be obtained in an exact analytic form. This allows us to obtain
the explicit form of the projections of the bulk Weyl tensor on the brane, and
the equation of state of the dark pressure as a function of the dark radiation.
The physical and geometrical quantities are expressed in terms of
observable/measurable parameters, like the tangential velocity, the baryonic
mass and the radius of the galaxy. We also analyze the dynamics of test
particles by using methods from the qualitative analysis of dynamical systems,
by assuming a simple linear equation of state for the dark pressure. The
obtained results provide a theoretical framework for the observational testing
at the extra-galactic scale of the predictions of the brane world models.
"
What are the stable species detected by gas chromatography in a premixed flame?,"  The structure of a laminar rich premixed 1,3-C4H6/CH4/O2/Ar flame have been
investigated. 1,3-Butadiene, methane, oxygen and argon mole fractions are
0.033; 0.2073; 0.3315, and 0.4280, respectively, for an equivalent ratio of
1.80. The flame has been stabilized on a burner at a pressure of 6.7 kPa (50
Torr). The concentration profiles of stable species were measured by gas
chromatography after sampling with a quartz probe. Quantified species included
carbon monoxide and dioxide, methane, oxygen, hydrogen, ethane, ethylene,
acetylene, propyne, allene, propene, cyclopropane, 1,3-butadiene, butenes,
1-butyne, vinylacetylene, diacetylene, C5 compounds, benzene, and toluene. The
temperature was measured thanks to a thermocouple in PtRh (6%)-PtRh (30%)
settled inside the enclosure and ranged from 900 K close to the burner up to
2100 K.
"
What is the behavior of the polarization of a qubit in the presence of a time-dependent magnetic field?,"  An exactly solvable model for the decoherence of one and two-qubit states
interacting with a spin-bath, in the presence of a time-dependent magnetic
field is studied. The magnetic field is static along $\hat{z}$ direction and
oscillatory in the transverse plane. The transition probability and Rabi
oscillations between the spin-states of a single qubit is shown to depend on
the size of bath, the distribution of qubit-bath couplings and the initial bath
polarization. In contrast to the fast Gaussian decay for short times, the
polarization of the qubit shows an oscillatory power-law decay for long times.
The loss of entanglement for the maximally entangled two-qubit states, can be
controlled by tuning the frequency of the rotating field. The decay rates of
entanglement and purity for all the Bell-states are same when the qubits are
non-interacting, and different when they are interacting.
"
What are the key factors in choosing the feedback gain matrix for Pyragus control of unstable periodic orbits?,"  For many years it was believed that an unstable periodic orbit with an odd
number of real Floquet multipliers greater than unity cannot be stabilized by
the time-delayed feedback control mechanism of Pyragus. A recent paper by
Fiedler et al uses the normal form of a subcritical Hopf bifurcation to give a
counterexample to this theorem. Using the Lorenz equations as an example, we
demonstrate that the stabilization mechanism identified by Fiedler et al for
the Hopf normal form can also apply to unstable periodic orbits created by
subcritical Hopf bifurcations in higher-dimensional dynamical systems. Our
analysis focuses on a particular codimension-two bifurcation that captures the
stabilization mechanism in the Hopf normal form example, and we show that the
same codimension-two bifurcation is present in the Lorenz equations with
appropriately chosen Pyragus-type time-delayed feedback. This example suggests
a possible strategy for choosing the feedback gain matrix in Pyragus control of
unstable periodic orbits that arise from a subcritical Hopf bifurcation of a
stable equilibrium. In particular, our choice of feedback gain matrix is
informed by the Fiedler et al example, and it works over a broad range of
parameters, despite the fact that a center-manifold reduction of the
higher-dimensional problem does not lead to their model problem.
"
What are the equilibrium equations for a conducting elastic rod in a uniform magnetic field?,"  We consider the equilibrium equations for a conducting elastic rod placed in
a uniform magnetic field, motivated by the problem of electrodynamic space
tethers. When expressed in body coordinates the equations are found to sit in a
hierarchy of non-canonical Hamiltonian systems involving an increasing number
of vector fields. These systems, which include the classical Euler and
Kirchhoff rods, are shown to be completely integrable in the case of a
transversely isotropic rod; they are in fact generated by a Lax pair. For the
magnetic rod this gives a physical interpretation to a previously proposed
abstract nine-dimensional integrable system. We use the conserved quantities to
reduce the equations to a four-dimensional canonical Hamiltonian system,
allowing the geometry of the phase space to be investigated through Poincar\'e
sections. In the special case where the force in the rod is aligned with the
magnetic field the system turns out to be superintegrable, meaning that the
phase space breaks down completely into periodic orbits, corresponding to
straight twisted rods.
"
What is the algebra of smooth functions in the metric of a compact Riemannian spin manifold?,"  It is well-known that a compact Riemannian spin manifold can be reconstructed
from its canonical spectral triple which consists of the algebra of smooth
functions, the Hilbert space of square integrable spinors and the Dirac
operator. It seems to be a folklore fact that the metric can be reconstructed
up to conformal equivalence if one replaces the Dirac operator D by sign(D). We
give a precise formulation and proof of this fact.
"
What is the oscillator formalism used to express the wedge states in string field theory?,"  This paper is primarily devoted to the ghost wedge states in string field
theory formulated with the oscillator formalism. Our aim is to prove, using
such formalism, that the wedge states can be expressed as
  |n> = exp[{2-n}/2 ({\cal L}_0+{\cal L}_0^\daggert)]|0>, separately in the
matter and ghost sector. This relation is crucial for instance in the proof of
Schnabl's solution. We start from the exponentials in the rhs and wish to prove
that they take precisely the form of wedge states. As a guideline we first
re-demonstrate this relation for the matter part. Then we turn to the ghosts.
On the way we face the problem of `diagonalizing' infinite rectangular
matrices. We manage to give a meaning to such an operation and to prove that
the eigenvalues we obtain satisfy the recursion relations of the wedge states.
"
What is the result of the first-order in 1/g_T weak localization correction to Hall resistivity in a two- or three-dimensional granular array?,"  We study the effects of localization on the Hall transport in a granular
system at large tunneling conductance $g_{T}\gg 1$ corresponding to the
metallic regime. We show that the first-order in 1/g_T weak localization
correction to Hall resistivity of a two- or three-dimensional granular array
vanishes identically, $\de \rho_{xy}^{WL}=0$. This result is in agreement with
the one for ordinary disordered metals. Being due to an exact cancellation, our
result holds for arbitrary relevant values of temperature T and magnetic field
H, both in the ``homogeneous'' regime of very low T and H corresponding to
ordinary disordered metals and in the ``structure-dependent'' regime of higher
values of T or H.
"
What is the relationship between covering homology and topological cyclic homology?,"  We introduce the notion of ""covering homology"" of a commutative ring spectrum
with respect to certain families of coverings of topological spaces. The
construction of covering homology is extracted from Bokstedt, Hsiang and
Madsen's topological cyclic homology. In fact covering homology with respect to
the family of orientation preserving isogenies of the circle is equal to
topological cyclic homology.
  Our basic tool for the analysis of covering homology is a cofibration
sequence involving homotopy orbits and a restriction map similar to the
restriction map used in Bokstedt, Hsiang and Madsen's construction of
topological cyclic homology.
  Covering homology with respect to families of isogenies of a torus is
constructed from iterated topological Hochschild homology. It receives a trace
map from iterated algebraic K-theory and the hope is that the rich structure,
and the calculability of covering homology will make covering homology useful
in the exploration of J. Rognes' ``red shift conjecture''.
"
What is the Gaussian potential used to measure in ferromagnetic microstrips?,"  Through exact numerical diagonalization for small numbers of atoms, we show
that it is possible to access quantum Hall states in harmonically confined Bose
gases at rotation frequencies well below the centrifugal limit by applying a
repulsive Gaussian potential at the trap center. The main idea is to reduce or
eliminate the effective trapping frequency in regions where the particle
density is appreciable. The critical rotation frequency required to obtain the
bosonic Laughlin state can be fixed at an experimentally accessible value by
choosing an applied Gaussian whose amplitude increases linearly with the number
of atoms while its width increases as the square root.
"
"What is the reason for the withdrawal of the paper ""Mixture models and exploratory analysis in networks""?","  This paper, which commented on Newman and Leicht's ""Mixture models and
exploratory analysis in networks"" (2007, PNAS 104, 9564-9569), has been
withdrawn. The reason for this removal is that we misinterpreted the conceptual
framework that the authors of the original paper use. Specifically, it is
assumed in our paper that the variable theta_ri denotes the *a priori*
probability that there exists an edge from group r to vertex i. The correct
interpretation is that theta_ri denotes the probability that a given edge from
group r connects to vertex i.
  We are very grateful to Mark Newman and Elizabeth Leicht not only for
pointing out our misinterpretation, but also for doing it so politely and
gracefully.
"
What is the electric field profile at the interface of the electron and hole regions in graphene?,"  We study the charge density distribution, the electric field profile, and the
resistance of an electrostatically created lateral p-n junction in graphene. We
show that the electric field at the interface of the electron and hole regions
is strongly enhanced due to limited screening capacity of Dirac quasiparticles.
Accordingly, the junction resistance is lower than estimated in previous
literature.
"
What are the two types of Hybrid quantum cloning machines?,"  In this work, we introduce a special kind of quantum cloning machine called
Hybrid quantum cloning machine. The introduced Hybrid quantum cloning machine
or transformation is nothing but a combination of pre-existing quantum cloning
transformations. In this sense it creates its own identity in the field of
quantum cloners. Hybrid quantum cloning machine can be of two types: (i) State
dependent and (ii) State independent or Universal. We study here the above two
types of Hybrid quantum cloning machines. Later we will show that the state
dependent hybrid quantum-cloning machine can be applied on only four input
states. We will also find in this paper another asymmetric universal quantum
cloning machine constructed from the combination of optimal universal B-H
quantum cloning machine and universal anti-cloning machine. The fidelities of
the two outputs are different and their values lie in the neighborhood of
${5/6} $
"
What is the nature of the globular cluster systems in the Hydra cluster?,"  NGC 3311, the giant cD galaxy in the Hydra cluster (A1060), has one of the
largest globular cluster systems known. We describe new Gemini GMOS (g',i')
photometry of the NGC 3311 field which reveals that the red, metal-rich side of
its globular cluster population extends smoothly upward into the mass range
associated with the new class of Ultra-Compact Dwarfs (UCDs). We identify 29
UCD candidates with estimated masses > 6x10^6 solar masses and discuss their
characteristics. This UCD-like sequence is the most well defined one yet seen,
and reinforces current ideas that the high-mass end of the globular cluster
sequence merges continuously into the UCD sequence, which connects in turn to
the E galaxy structural sequence.
"
What is the volume ratio of the channels simulated by a single-qubit mixed-state environment?,"  We study a generalized amplitude damping channel when environment is
initially in the single-qubit mixed state. Representing the affine
transformation of the generalized amplitude damping by a three-dimensional
volume, we plot explicitly the volume occupied by the channels simulatable by a
single-qubit mixed-state environment. As expected, this volume is embedded in
the total volume by the channels which is simulated by two-qubit enviroment.
The volume ratio is approximately 0.08 which is much smaller than 3/8, the
volume ratio for generalized depolarizing channels.
"
What are the implications of the distance-regularity characterization of a crooked graph for the Preparata-like code?,"  We give two characterizations of crooked functions: one based on the minimum
distance of a Preparata-like code, and the other based on the
distance-regularity of a crooked graph.
"
What are the strong bounds for the number of sheets and the topology of the branching set for dimension d <= 4?,"  Branched covers are applied frequently in topology - most prominently in the
construction of closed oriented PL d-manifolds. In particular, strong bounds
for the number of sheets and the topology of the branching set are known for
dimension d<=4. On the other hand, Izmestiev and Joswig described how to obtain
a simplicial covering space (the partial unfolding) of a given simplicial
complex, thus obtaining a simplicial branched cover [Adv. Geom. 3(2):191-255,
2003]. We present a large class of branched covers which can be constructed via
the partial unfolding. In particular, for d<=4 every closed oriented PL
d-manifold is the partial unfolding of some polytopal d-sphere.
"
How is the trajectory plotted in a cosmological solution with a cosmological constant?,"  We shall show that it is possible to make a causal interpretation of loop
quantum cosmology using the momentum as the dynamical variable. We shall show
that one can derive Bohmian trajectories. For a sample cosmological solution
with cosmological constant, the trajectory is plotted.
"
What are the implications of the expansion of the universe on the rotation of the Earth?,"  We have developed a model for the Earth rotation that gives a good account
(data) of the Earth astronomical parameters. These data can be compared with
the ones obtained using space-base telescopes. The expansion of the universe
has an impact on the rotation of planets, and in particular, the Earth. The
expansion of the universe causes an acceleration that is exhibited by all
planets.
"
What is the effect of the increase in the medium density between the two energies?,"  Using a final state interaction model which describes the data on these two
observables, at RHIC, we make predictions at the LHC -- using the same
cross-section and pT-shift. The increase in the medium density between these
two energies (by a factor close to three) produces an increase of the fixed pT
pi0 suppression by a factor 2 at large pT and of v2 by a factor 1.5.

What is the relationship between the spin-modulated radial velocities and the corotation of the accretion curtain in the IP EX Hya?,"  Results from spectroscopic observations of the Intermediate Polar (IP) EX Hya
in quiescence during 1991 and 2001 are presented. Spin-modulated radial
velocities consistent with an outer disc origin were detected for the first
time in an IP. The spin pulsation was modulated with velocities near ~500-600
km/s. These velocities are consistent with those of material circulating at the
outer edge of the accretion disc, suggesting corotation of the accretion
curtain with material near the Roche lobe radius. Furthermore, spin Doppler
tomograms have revealed evidence of the accretion curtain emission extending
from velocities of ~500 km/s to ~1000 km/s. These findings have confirmed the
theoretical model predictions of King & Wynn (1999), Belle et al. (2002) and
Norton et al. (2004) for EX Hya, which predict large accretion curtains that
extend to a distance close to the Roche lobe radius in this system. Evidence
for overflow stream of material falling onto the magnetosphere was observed,
confirming the result of Belle et al. (2005) that disc overflow in EX Hya is
present during quiescence as well as outburst. It appears that the hbeta and
hgamma spin radial velocities originated from the rotation of the funnel at the
outer disc edge, while those of halpha were produced due to the flow of
material along the field lines far from the white dwarf (narrow component) and
close to the white dwarf (broad-base component), in agreement with the
accretion curtain model.
"
What are the implications of the observed superhumps for the star being a member of the UGWZ sub-class?,"  During 2006 March the first confirmed superoutburst of the dwarf nova SDSS
J080434.20+510349.2 was observed using unfiltered CCD photometry. Time-series
photometry revealed superhumps with a period of 0.0597 +/- 0.0011 d and an
amplitude of 0.2 magnitude, thereby independently establishing its UGSU
classification. Following the decline from a peak magnitude of 13.1, at least
two rebrightening events were observed. Evidence is presented which is
consistent with the star being a member of the UGWZ sub-class.
"
What is the possibility of using the QSPN v2 on the high levels of the fractal?,"  In this document, we describe the fractal structure of the Netsukuku
topology. Moreover, we show how it is possible to use the QSPN v2 on the high
levels of the fractal.
"
What are the progenitor properties of GRB 050826 as a function of redshift?,"  We present the optical identification and spectroscopy of the host galaxy of
GRB 050826 at a redshift z = 0.296 +/- 0.001. Image subtraction among
observations obtained on three consecutive nights, reveals a fading object 5
hours after the burst, confirming its identification as the optical afterglow
of this event. Deep imaging shows that the optical afterglow is offset by 0.4
arcseconds (~1.76 kpc) from the center of its irregular host galaxy, which is
typical for long-duration gamma-ray bursts. Combining these results with X-ray
measurements acquired by the Swift XRT instrument, we find that GRB 050826
falls entirely within the subluminous, subenergetic group of long gamma-ray
bursts at low redshift (z < 0.3). The results are discussed in the context of
models that possibly account for this trend, including the nature of the
central engine, the evolution of progenitor properties as a function of
redshift, and incompleteness in current gamma-ray burst samples.
"
What are the implications of the fallback GRBs on our understanding of their progenitors?,"  The currently-favored model for long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) invokes
explosions from the collapse of a massive star down to a black hole: either
directly or through fallback. Those GRBs forming via fallback will produce much
less radioactive nickel, and hence it has been argued (without any real
calculation) that these systems produce dim supernovae. These fallback
black-hole GRBs have been recently been argued as possible progenitors of a
newly discovered set of GRBs lacking any associated supernovae. Here we present
the first ever radiation-hydrodynamics calculations of the light-curves
produced in the hypernova explosion by a delayed-fallback gamma-ray burst. We
find that the bolometric light-curve is dominated by shock-deposited energy,
not the decay of radioactive elements. As such, observations of such bursts
actually probe the density in the progenitor wind more than it does the
production of radioactive nickel.
"
What are the central objects in the scheme?,"  We present a systematic semiclassical procedure to compute the partition
function for scalar field theories at finite temperature. The central objects
in our scheme are the solutions of the classical equations of motion in
imaginary time, with spatially independent boundary conditions. Field
fluctuations -- both field deviations around these classical solutions, and
fluctuations of the boundary value of the fields -- are resummed in a Gaussian
approximation. In our final expression for the partition function, this
resummation is reduced to solving certain ordinary differential equations.
Moreover, we show that it is renormalizable with the usual 1-loop counterterms.
"
What are the requirements for realizing the one-way quantum computing?,"  We introduce a novel scheme for one-way quantum computing (QC) based on the
use of information encoded qubits in an effective cluster state resource. With
the correct encoding structure, we show that it is possible to protect the
entangled resource from phase damping decoherence, where the effective cluster
state can be described as residing in a Decoherence-Free Subspace (DFS) of its
supporting quantum system. One-way QC then requires either single or two-qubit
adaptive measurements. As an example where this proposal can be realized, we
describe an optical lattice setup where the scheme provides robust quantum
information processing. We also outline how one can adapt the model to provide
protection from other types of decoherence.
"
What is the relationship between the ratio J/Jc and the frequency dependence of the charge noise in Josephson qubits?,"  We show that charge noise $S_Q$ in Josephson qubits can be produced by
fluctuating two level systems (TLS) with electric dipole moments in the
substrate using a flat density of states. At high frequencies the frequency and
temperature dependence of the charge noise depends on the ratio $J/J_c$ of the
electromagnetic flux $J$ to the critical flux $J_c$. It is not widely
appreciated that TLS in small qubits can easily be strongly saturated with
$J/J_c\gg 1$. Our results are consistent with experimental conclusions that
$S_Q\sim 1/f$ at low frequencies and $S_Q\sim f$ at high frequencies.
"
What are the future developments desired on the theoretical and experimental sides?,"  A survey is given on the present knowledge of the polarized parton
distribution functions. We give an outlook for further developments desired
both on the theoretical as well on the experimental side to complete the
understanding of the spin--structure of nucleons in the future.
"
What is the achievable perfect secrecy rate in a type II binary symmetric wiretap channel?,"  This paper considers the problem of secure coding design for a type II
wiretap channel, where the main channel is noiseless and the eavesdropper
channel is a general binary-input symmetric-output memoryless channel. The
proposed secure error-correcting code has a nested code structure. Two secure
nested coding schemes are studied for a type II Gaussian wiretap channel. The
nesting is based on cosets of a good code sequence for the first scheme and on
cosets of the dual of a good code sequence for the second scheme. In each case,
the corresponding achievable rate-equivocation pair is derived based on the
threshold behavior of good code sequences. The two secure coding schemes
together establish an achievable rate-equivocation region, which almost covers
the secrecy capacity-equivocation region in this case study. The proposed
secure coding scheme is extended to a type II binary symmetric wiretap channel.
A new achievable perfect secrecy rate, which improves upon the previously
reported result by Thangaraj et al., is derived for this channel.
"
What is the relationship between the average size of spatial domains and the rate of phase growth in a system of coupled chaotic bistable maps?,"  A system of coupled chaotic bistable maps on a lattice with randomly
distributed impurities is investigated as a model for studying the phenomenon
of phase growth in nonuniform media. The statistical properties of the system
are characterized by means of the average size of spatial domains of equivalent
spin variables that define the phases. It is found that the rate at which phase
domains grow becomes smaller when impurities are present and that the average
size of the resulting domains in the inhomogeneous state of the system
decreases when the density of impurities is increased. The phase diagram
showing regions where homogeneous, heterogeneous, and chessboard patterns occur
on the space of parameters of the system is obtained. A critical boundary that
separates the regime of slow growth of domains from the regime of fast growth
in the heterogeneous region of the phase diagram is calculated. The transition
between these two growth regimes is explained in terms of the stability
properties of the local phase configurations. Our results show that the
inclusion of spatial inhomogeneities can be used as a control mechanism for the
size and growth velocity of phase domains forming in spatiotemporal systems.
"
What are the implications of the microscopic driving mechanisms and polarization and frequency dependence of excitonic instabilities in semiconductor quantum wells for the pump-probe setup?,"  Based on a microscopic many-particle theory, we predict large optical gain in
the probe and background-free four-wave mixing directions caused by excitonic
instabilities in semiconductor quantum wells. For a single quantum well with
radiative-decay limited dephasing in a typical pump-probe setup we discuss the
microscopic driving mechanisms and polarization and frequency dependence of
these instabilities.
"
What are the momentum and magneto-chiral properties of magneto-electric media?,"  In this work we apply field regularization techniques to formulate a number
of new phenomena related to momentum induced by electromagnetic zero-point
fluctuations. We discuss the zero-point momentum associated with
magneto-electric media, with moving media, and with magneto-chiral media.
"
What is the relationship between the Laplacian matrix and the synchronization time in complex networks?,"  Dynamical properties of complex networks are related to the spectral
properties of the Laplacian matrix that describes the pattern of connectivity
of the network. In particular we compute the synchronization time for different
types of networks and different dynamics. We show that the main dependence of
the synchronization time is on the smallest nonzero eigenvalue of the Laplacian
matrix, in contrast to other proposals in terms of the spectrum of the
adjacency matrix. Then, this topological property becomes the most relevant for
the dynamics.
"
What is the asymptotic estimate of the vertical distance between the stable and unstable manifolds of the system y(t+\epsilon)=y(t-\epsilon)+2\epsilon\big(1-y(t)^{2}\big)?,"  We consider the discretization
  y(t+\epsilon)=y(t-\epsilon)+2\epsilon\big(1-y(t)^{2}\big),
  $\epsilon>0$ a small parameter, of the logistic differential equation
$y'=2\big(1-y^{2}\big)$, which can also be seen as a discretization of the
system
  {y'=2\big(1-v^{2}\big),
  v'= 2\big(1-y^{2}\big).
  This system has two saddle points at $A=(1,1)$, $B=(-1, -1)$ and there exist
stable and unstable manifolds. We will show that the stable manifold
$W_{s}^{+}$ of the point $A=(1,1)$ and the unstable manifold $W_{i}^{-}$ of the
point $B=(-1, -1)$ for the discretization do not coincide. The vertical
distance between these two manifolds is exponentially small but not zero, in
particular we give an asymptotic estimate of this distance. For this purpose we
will use a method adapted from the paper of Sch\""afke-Volkmer \cite{SV} using
formal series and accurate estimates of the coefficients.
"
What is the Doppler effect used to extract thermal energy from a Brownian motion in a laser beam?,"  A laser beam directed at a mirror attached onto a flexible mount extracts
thermal energy from its mechanical Brownian motion by Doppler effect. For a
normal mirror the efficiency of this Doppler cooling is very weak and masked by
laser shot-noise. We find that it can become very efficient using a Bragg
mirror at the long wavelength edge of its band stop. The opposite effect of
cooling opens new routes for optical pumping of mechanical systems: a laser
pointing at a Bragg mirror and tuned at its short wavelength edge induces
amplification of the vibrational excitation of the mirror leading eventually to
its self-oscillation. This new effects rely on the strong dependency of the
Bragg mirror reflectivity on the wavelength.
"
What are the electronic and structural properties of boron doped graphene sheets?,"  The electronic and structural properties of (i) boron doped graphene sheets,
and (ii) the chemisorption processes of hydrogen adatoms on the boron doped
graphene sheets have been examined by {\it ab initio} total energy
calculations.
"
What improvements were made to a previously developed mechanism to model the reactions of C3-C4 unsaturated hydrocarbons in the doped methane flames?,"  The structure of three laminar premixed rich flames has been investigated: a
pure methane flame and two methane flames doped by allene and propyne,
respectively. The gases of the three flames contain 20.9% (molar) of methane
and 33.4% of oxygen, corresponding to an equivalence ratio of 1.25 for the pure
methane flame. In both doped flames, 2.49% of C3H4 was added, corresponding to
a ratio C3H4/CH4 of 12% and an equivalence ratio of 1.55. The three flames have
been stabilized on a burner at a pressure of 6.7 kPa using argon as dilutant,
with a gas velocity at the burner of 36 cm/s at 333 K. The concentration
profiles of stable species were measured by gas chromatography after sampling
with a quartz microprobe. Quantified species included carbon monoxide and
dioxide, methane, oxygen, hydrogen, ethane, ethylene, acetylene, propyne,
allene, propene, propane, 1,2-butadiene, 1,3-butadiene, 1-butene, isobutene,
1-butyne, vinylacetylene, and benzene. The temperature was measured using a
PtRh (6%)-PtRh (30%) thermocouple settled inside the enclosure and ranged from
700 K close to the burner up to 1850 K. In order to model these new results,
some improvements have been made to a mechanism previously developed in our
laboratory for the reactions of C3-C4 unsaturated hydrocarbons. The main
reaction pathways of consumption of allene and propyne and of formation of C6
aromatic species have been derived from flow rate analyses.
"
What is the Weil and Cartan model for equivariant cohomology of noncommutative spaces?,"  We propose Weil and Cartan models for the equivariant cohomology of
noncommutative spaces which carry a covariant action of Drinfel'd twisted
symmetries. The construction is suggested by the noncommutative Weil algebra of
Alekseev and Meinrenken; we show that one can implement a Drinfel'd twist of
their models in order to take into account the noncommutativity of the spaces
we are acting on.
"
What are the results of 3 experiments in Costas arrays?,"  The results of 3 experiments in Costas arrays are presented, for which
theoretical explanation is still not available: the number of dots on the main
diagonal of exponential Welch arrays, the parity populations of Golomb arrays
generated in fields of characteristic 2, and the maximal cross-correlation
between pairs of Welch or Golomb arrays generated in fields of size equal to a
Sophie Germain prime.
"
What is the quasiparticle mass in the underdoped cuprate superconductor YBa2Cu4O8?,"  We report the observation of quantum oscillations in the underdoped cuprate
superconductor YBa2Cu4O8 using a tunnel-diode oscillator technique in pulsed
magnetic fields up to 85T. There is a clear signal, periodic in inverse field,
with frequency 660+/-15T and possible evidence for the presence of two
components of slightly different frequency. The quasiparticle mass is
m*=3.0+/-0.3m_e. In conjunction with the results of Doiron-Leyraud et al. for
YBa2Cu3O6.5, the present measurements suggest that Fermi surface pockets are a
general feature of underdoped copper oxide planes and provide information about
the doping dependence of the Fermi surface.
"
What are the conditions for a Riesz integral to be a Riesz integral?,"  We present a Riesz integral representation theory in which functions,
operators and measures take values in uniform commutative monoids (a
commutative monoid with a uniformity making the binary operation of the monoid
uniformly continuous). It describes the operators to which the theory can be
applied and the finitely-additive measures they generate. Operators satisfying
the conditions will be called ``Riesz integrals''. Given an underlying ``Riesz
system'', it is shown that every Riesz integral generates a certain kind of
finitely additive measure called here a ``Riesz measure''. The correspondence
between Riesz integrals and Riesz measures is a bijection.
  A straightforward calculation shows that if an operator has such a
representation, then it must have the Hammerstein property. For topological
vector spaces, the theory yields necessary and sufficient conditions for
operators with the Hammerstein property to be Riesz integrals. We note that
uniform commutative monoids arise naturally when considering set-valued
functions, and that the axioms of a Riesz system rule out certain spaces of
infinitely differentiable functions.
"
What is the alternative axiomatization of the Chellas STIT?,"  We propose two alternatives to Xu's axiomatization of the Chellas STIT. The
first one also provides an alternative axiomatization of the deliberative STIT.
The second one starts from the idea that the historic necessity operator can be
defined as an abbreviation of operators of agency, and can thus be eliminated
from the logic of the Chellas STIT. The second axiomatization also allows us to
establish that the problem of deciding the satisfiability of a STIT formula
without temporal operators is NP-complete in the single-agent case, and is
NEXPTIME-complete in the multiagent case, both for the deliberative and the
Chellas' STIT.
"
What is the current density through a ferromagnet-semiconductor junction?,"  It was recently predicted [Phys. Rev. B 75, 193301 (2007)] that spin blockade
may develop at nonmagnetic semiconductor/perfect ferromagnet junctions when the
electron flow is directed from the semiconductor into the ferromagnet. Here we
consider current-voltage characteristics of such junctions. By taking into
account the contact resistance, we demonstrate a current stabilization effect:
by increasing the applied voltage the current density through the junction
saturates at a specific value. The transient behavior of the current density is
also investigated.
"
How to determine whether a Hermitian manifold is of constant sectional curvatures?,"  In dimension greater than four, we prove that if a Hermitian non-Kaehler
manifold is of pointwise constant antiholomorphic sectional curvatures, then it
is of constant sectional curvatures.
"
What is the origin of the renormalized band widths of TTF-TCNQ in the one-dimensional Hubbard model?,"  We have performed angle-dependent near-edge x-ray absorption fine structure
measurements in the Auger electron yield mode on the correlated
quasi-one-dimensional organic conductor TTF-TCNQ in order to determine the
orientation of the molecules in the topmost surface layer. We find that the
tilt angles of the molecules with respect to the one-dimensional axis are
essentially the same as in the bulk. Thus we can rule out surface relaxation as
the origin of the renormalized band widths which were inferred from the
analysis of photoemission data within the one-dimensional Hubbard model.
Thereby recent theoretical results are corroborated which invoke long-range
Coulomb repulsion as alternative explanation to understand the spectral
dispersions of TTF-TCNQ quantitatively within an extended Hubbard model.
"
What are the quantum properties of fractals in quantum systems?,"  The fractal character of some quantum properties has been shown for systems
described by continuous variables. Here, a definition of quantum fractal states
is given that suits the discrete systems used in quantum information
processing, including quantum coding and quantum computing. Several important
examples are provided.
"
What are the elliptic flow and polar anisotropy in a relativistic heavy ion collision?,"  We obtain the initial phase space distribution after relativistic heavy ion
collision by the CGC shattering method incorporating the uncertainty principle
and solve the semi-classical Boltzmann equation which includes the gluon
radiation processes. We present as a function of time the attenuation rate of
high $p_T$ partons, which have transverse momenta over 6 $GeV/c$, in the medium
which is formed after relativistic heavy ion collision. We calculate the
elliptic flow as a function of an impact parameter, time and transverse
momentum and also present the polar anisotropy, which gives the initial
condition for color filamentation.
"
What are the implications of the radio jets in the observed ULIRGs for the growth and evolution of these objects?,"  Recent Spitzer observations have revealed a substantial population of z~2
ULIRGs with deep silicate absorption (\tau_{9.7}>1). This paper reports a 20cm
radio study of such a sample to elucidate their physical nature. We discover
that a substantial fraction (40%) of deep silicate absorption ULIRGs at z~2 are
moderately radio-loud with L_{1.4GHz}=10^{25}--10^{26}WHz^{-1}. This is in
strong contrast with z<1 radio galaxies and radio-loud quasars where none of
the sources with available IRS spectra have \tau_{9.7}>1. In addition, we
observe radio jets in two of our sources where one has a double lobe structure
~200kpc in extent, and another shows a one-sided jet extending ~90kpc from the
nucleus. The likely high inclination of the latter, coupled with its deep
silicate absorption, implies the mid-IR obscuration does not share an axis with
the radio jets. These sources are highly obscured quasars, observed in the
transition stage after the birth of the radio source, but before feedback
effects dispel the ISM and halt the black hole accretion and starburst
activity.
"
What are the challenges in equivalence-checking for quantum circuits?,"  Quantum computing promises exponential speed-ups for important simulation and
optimization problems. It also poses new CAD problems that are similar to, but
more challenging, than the related problems in classical (non-quantum) CAD,
such as determining if two states or circuits are functionally equivalent.
While differences in classical states are easy to detect, quantum states, which
are represented by complex-valued vectors, exhibit subtle differences leading
to several notions of equivalence. This provides flexibility in optimizing
quantum circuits, but leads to difficult new equivalence-checking issues for
simulation and synthesis. We identify several different equivalence-checking
problems and present algorithms for practical benchmarks, including quantum
communication and search circuits, which are shown to be very fast and robust
for hundreds of qubits.
"
What are the possible reasons for the difference in dust temperature between the two galaxies?,"  Far-infrared (IR) images of the nearby Sb galaxy NGC2841 and the Sc galaxy
NGC2976 at wavelengths of 65, 90, 140, and 160 um have been obtained with the
Far-Infrared Surveyor (FIS) onboard AKARI. Both galaxies reveal similar
morphologies of dust rings. They are, however, significantly different in the
dust temperature: a cold (21 K) ring for NGC2841 and a warm (30 K) ring for
NGC2976, which presumably reflects the difference in the origin of the ring
structure for the different Hubble type of the galaxy. In addition to the dust
ring structure, a warm dust component is detected from the central region of
NGC2841, which may be attributed to the heating by its Low-Ionization Nuclear
Emission-line Region nucleus. As for NGC2976, an extended dust component is
observed along the minor axis, which shows a distribution somewhat asymmetrical
to the galactic disk; this might be associated with the HI bridge in the
M81/M82 group that NGC2976 belongs to. By taking advantage of a wealth of the
far-IR bands of the FIS, it is demonstrated that the spectral energy
distribution of NGC2841 is spatially more variable than that of NGC2976.
"
What are the experimental variables of optical tweezers instrumentation that affect RNA folding/unfolding kinetics?,"  Experimental variables of optical tweezers instrumentation that affect RNA
folding/unfolding kinetics were investigated. A model RNA hairpin, P5ab, was
attached to two micron-sized beads through hybrid RNA/DNA handles; one bead was
trapped by dual-beam lasers and the other was held by a micropipette. Several
experimental variables were changed while measuring the unfolding/refolding
kinetics, including handle lengths, trap stiffness, and modes of force applied
to the molecule. In constant-force mode where the tension applied to the RNA
was maintained through feedback control, the measured rate coefficients varied
within 40% when the handle lengths were changed by 10 fold (1.1 to 10.2 Kbp);
they increased by two- to three-fold when the trap stiffness was lowered to one
third (from 0.1 to 0.035 pN/nm). In the passive mode, without feedback control
and where the force applied to the RNA varied in response to the end-to-end
distance change of the tether, the RNA hopped between a high-force folded-state
and a low-force unfolded-state. In this mode, the rates increased up to
two-fold with longer handles or softer traps. Overall, the measured rates
remained with the same order-of-magnitude over the wide range of conditions
studied. In the companion paper (1), we analyze how the measured kinetics
parameters differ from the intrinsic molecular rates of the RNA, and thus how
to obtain the molecular rates.
"
What is the role of Cu dimers in the indirect Fe-Fe exchange coupling?,"  Cu$_2$Fe$_2$Ge$_4$O$_{13}$ is a bicomponent compound that consists of Cu
dimers and Fe chains with separate energy scale. By inelastic neutron
scattering technique with high-energy resolution we observed the indirect Fe -
Fe exchange coupling by way of the Cu dimers. The obtained parameters of the
effective indirect interaction and related superexchange interactions are
consistent with those estimated semi-statically. The consistency reveals that
the Cu dimers play the role of nonmagnetic media in the indirect magnetic
interaction.
"
What is the purpose of the two wrists in the haptic device?,"  This paper is devoted to the kinematic design of a new six degree-of-freedom
haptic device using two parallel mechanisms. The first one, called orthoglide,
provides the translation motions and the second one, called agile eye, produces
the rotational motions. These two motions are decoupled to simplify the direct
and inverse kinematics, as it is needed for real-time control. To reduce the
inertial load, the motors are fixed on the base and a transmission with two
universal joints is used to transmit the rotational motions from the base to
the end-effector. Two alternative wrists are proposed (i), the agile eye with
three degrees of freedom or (ii) a hybrid wrist made by the assembly of a
two-dof agile eye with a rotary motor. The last one is optimized to increase
its stiffness and to decrease the number of moving parts.
"
What are the implications of the bow-shock nebula for the pulsar's energetics?,"  We have studied the nearby old pulsar PSR B1929+10 and its surrounding
interstellar medium utilizing the sub-arcsecond angular resolution of the
Chandra X-ray Observatory. The Chandra data are found to be fully consistent
with the results obtained from deep XMM-Newton observations as far as the
pulsar is concerned. We confirm the non-thermal emission nature of the pulsar's
X-radiation. In addition to the X-ray trail already seen in previous
observations by the ROSAT and XMM-Newton X-ray observatories, we discovered an
arc-like nebula surrounding the pulsar. We interpret the feature as a bow-shock
nebula and discuss its energetics in the context of standard shock theory.
"
What are the assumptions on the bounded harmonic functions of anisotropic fractional Laplacians?,"  We prove that bounded harmonic functions of anisotropic fractional Laplacians
are H\""older continuous under mild regularity assumptions on the corresponding
L\'evy measure. Under some stronger assumptions the Green function, Poisson
kernel and the harmonic functions are even differentiable of order up to three.
"
What is the electromagnetic coupling between self-assembled quantum dots?,"  We report on the experimental observation of a hitherto ignored long-range
electromagnetic coupling between self-assembled quantum dots. A 12 times
enhancement of the quantum dot exciton lifetime is observed by means of
time-resolved differential reflection spectroscopy. The enhancement is
explained by utilizing and extending the local field effects as developed in
\emph{Phys. Rev. B \textbf{64},125326 (2001)}. The electromagnetic coupling of
the quantum dots results in a collective polarizability, and is observed as a
suppression of the emission rate. Our results reveal that the coupling is
established over a distance exceeding 490 nm. Moreover, the mutual coupling
strength is optically tuned by varying the pump excitation density and enables
us to optically tune the exciton lifetime.
"
What is the comparison between the energies obtained via dynamics and the ground state energy?,"  Different sets of metastable states can be reached in glassy systems below
some transition temperature depending on initial conditions and details of the
dynamics. This is investigated for the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick spin glass model
with long ranged interactions. In particular, the time dependent local field
distribution and energy are calculated for zero temperature. This is done for a
system quenched to zero temperature, slow cooling or simulated annealing, a
greedy algorithm and repeated tapping. Results are obtained from Monte-Carlo
simulations and a Master-Fokker-Planck approach. A comparison with replica
symmetry broken theory, evaluated in high orders, shows that the energies
obtained via dynamics are higher than the ground state energy of replica
theory. Tapping and simulated annealing yield on the other hand results which
are very close to the ground state energy. The local field distribution tends
to zero for small fields. This is in contrast to the Edwards flat measure
hypothesis. The distribution of energies obtained for different tapping
strengths does again not follow the canonical form proposed by Edwards.
"
What is the law of large numbers that SVMs require to learn from realizations of an i.i.d. process?,"  In most papers establishing consistency for learning algorithms it is assumed
that the observations used for training are realizations of an i.i.d. process.
In this paper we go far beyond this classical framework by showing that support
vector machines (SVMs) essentially only require that the data-generating
process satisfies a certain law of large numbers. We then consider the
learnability of SVMs for $\a$-mixing (not necessarily stationary) processes for
both classification and regression, where for the latter we explicitly allow
unbounded noise.
"
What is the Laplace transform of the diffusivity D(t) of finite-range asymmetric exclusion processes?,"  The diffusivity $D(t)$ of finite-range asymmetric exclusion processes on
$\mathbb Z$ with non-zero drift is expected to be of order $t^{1/3}$.
Sepp\""{a}l\""ainen and Bal\'azs recently proved this conjecture for the nearest
neighbor case. We extend their results to general finite range exclusion by
proving that the Laplace transform of the diffusivity is of the conjectured
order. We also obtain a pointwise upper bound for $D(t)$ the correct order.
"
What is the concept of accumulation horizons in phase diagrams of single-mode semiconductors?,"  We study the hierarchical structuring of islands of stable periodic
oscillations inside chaotic regions in phase diagrams of single-mode
semiconductor lasers with optical injection. Phase diagrams display remarkable
{\it accumulation horizons}: boundaries formed by the accumulation of infinite
cascades of self-similar islands of periodic solutions of ever-increasing
period. Each cascade follows a specific period-adding route. The riddling of
chaotic laser phases by such networks of periodic solutions may compromise
applications operating with chaotic signals such as e.g. secure communications.
"
What is the stochastic approach for analyzing the dynamics of transcriptional noise in genetic regulatory networks?,"  Recently, several studies have investigated the transcription process
associated to specific genetic regulatory networks. In this work, we present a
stochastic approach for analyzing the dynamics and effect of negative feedback
loops (FBL) on the transcriptional noise. First, our analysis allows us to
identify a bimodal activity depending of the strength of self-repression
coupling D. In the strong coupling region D>>1, the variance of the
transcriptional noise is found to be reduced a 28 % more than described
earlier. Secondly, the contribution of the noise effect to the abundance of
regulating protein becomes manifest when the coefficient of variation is
computed. In the strong coupling region, this coefficient is found to be
independent of all parameters and in fair agreement with the experimentally
observed values. Finally, our analysis reveals that the regulating protein is
significantly induced by the intrinsic and external noise in the strong
coupling region. In short, it indicates that the existence of inherent noise in
FBL makes it possible to produce a basal amount of proteins even though the
repression level D is very strong.
"
What is the symplectic kernel that governs both the real and complex correlations?,"  We give a simple derivation of all $n$-point densities for the eigenvalues of
the real Ginibre ensemble with even dimension $N$ as quaternion determinants. A
very simple symplectic kernel governs both, the real and complex correlations.
1-and-2-point correlations are discussed in more detail. Scaling forms for
large dimension $N$ are derived.

What is the single-index model used to cope with high-dimensional problems in nonparametric regression?,"  For the past two decades, single-index model, a special case of projection
pursuit regression, has proven to be an efficient way of coping with the high
dimensional problem in nonparametric regression. In this paper, based on weakly
dependent sample, we investigate the single-index prediction (SIP) model which
is robust against deviation from the single-index model. The single-index is
identified by the best approximation to the multivariate prediction function of
the response variable, regardless of whether the prediction function is a
genuine single-index function. A polynomial spline estimator is proposed for
the single-index prediction coefficients, and is shown to be root-n consistent
and asymptotically normal. An iterative optimization routine is used which is
sufficiently fast for the user to analyze large data of high dimension within
seconds. Simulation experiments have provided strong evidence that corroborates
with the asymptotic theory. Application of the proposed procedure to the rive
flow data of Iceland has yielded superior out-of-sample rolling forecasts.
"
What is the relationship between a sequence of cones of positive operators in a *-representation of an algebra $\mathcal{A}$ on a Hilbert space?,"  We study the question when for a given *-algebra $\mathcal{A}$ a sequence of
cones $C_n\in M_n(\mathcal{A})$ can be realized as cones of positive operators
in a faithful *-representation of $\mathcal{A}$ on a Hilbert space. A
characterization of operator algebras which are completely boundedly isomorphic
to $C\sp*$-algebras is presented.
"
What is the comparison between the performance of CDMA and BIAWGN channels?,"  Sparse Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA), a variation on the standard CDMA
method in which the spreading (signature) matrix contains only a relatively
small number of non-zero elements, is presented and analysed using methods of
statistical physics. The analysis provides results on the performance of
maximum likelihood decoding for sparse spreading codes in the large system
limit. We present results for both cases of regular and irregular spreading
matrices for the binary additive white Gaussian noise channel (BIAWGN) with a
comparison to the canonical (dense) random spreading code.
"
What are cofibrations in the category of Frölicher spaces?,"  Cofibrations are defined in the category of Fr\""olicher spaces by weakening
the analog of the classical definition to enable smooth homotopy extensions to
be more easily constructed, using flattened unit intervals. We later relate
smooth cofibrations to smooth neighborhood deformation retracts. The notion of
smooth neighborhood deformation retract gives rise to an analogous result that
a closed Fr\""olicher subspace $A$ of the Fr\""olicher space $X$ is a smooth
neighborhood deformation retract of $X$ if and only if the inclusion $i:
A\hookrightarrow X$ comes from a certain subclass of cofibrations. As an
application we construct the right Puppe sequence.
"
What is the entropy formula for extremal black holes in spherically symmetric?,"  In this paper we elaborate on the relation between the entropy formula of
Wald and the ""entropy function"" method proposed by A. Sen. For spherically
symmetric extremal black holes, it is shown that the expression of extremal
black hole entropy given by A. Sen can be derived from the general entropy
definition of Wald, without help of the treatment of rescaling the AdS_2 part
of near horizon geometry of extremal black holes. In our procedure, we only
require that the surface gravity approaches to zero, and it is easy to
understand the Legendre transformation of f, the integration of Lagrangian
density on the horizon, with respect to the electric charges. Since the Noether
charge form can be defined in an ""off-shell"" form, we define a corresponding
entropy function, with which one can discuss the attractor mechanism for
extremal black holes with scalar fields.
"
What are the updated values of the axial form factor obtained from neutrino experiments?,"  We present new parameterizations of vector and axial nucleon form factors. We
maintain an excellent descriptions of the form factors at low momentum
transfers, where the spatial structure of the nucleon is important, and use the
Nachtman scaling variable \xi to relate elastic and inelastic form factors and
impose quark-hadron duality constraints at high momentum transfers where the
quark structure dominates. We use the new vector form factors to re-extract
updated values of the axial form factor from neutrino experiments on deuterium.
We obtain an updated world average value from neutrino and pion
electroproduction experiments of M_A = 1.0144 +- 0.0136 GeV/c2. Our
parameterizations are useful in modeling atmospheric neutrino interactions
(e.g. for neutrino oscillations experiments)
"
What is the property of the graph G_r^σ that makes it an edge-disjoint union of copies of X_i?,"  Let $r>2$ and $\sigma\in(0,r-1)$ be integers. We require $t<2s$, where
$t=2^{\sigma+1}-1$ and $s=2^{r-\sigma-1}$. Generalizing a known
$\{K_4,T_{6,3}\}$-ultrahomogenous graph $G_3^1$, we find that a finite,
connected, undirected, arc-transitive graph $G_r^\sigma$ exists each of whose
edges is shared by just two maximal subgraphs, namely a clique $X_0=K_{2s}$ and
a $t$-partite regular-Tur\'an graph $X_1=T_{st,t}$ on $s$ vertices per part.
Each copy $Y$ of $X_i$ ($i=0,1$) in $G_r^\sigma$ shares each edge with just one
copy of $X_{1-i}$ and all such copies of $X_{1-i}$ are pairwise distinct.
Moreover, $G_r^\sigma$ is an edge-disjoint union of copies of $X_i$, for
$i=0,1$. We prove that $G_r^\sigma$ is $\{K_{2s},T_{st,t}\}$-homogeneous if
$t<2s$, and just $\{T_{st,t}\}$-homogeneous otherwise, meaning that there is an
automorphism of $G_r^\sigma$ between any two such copies of $X_i$ relating two
preselected arcs.
"
"What are the observational implications of this mechanism, including its effects on galaxy evolution, star formation, and the growth of SMBHs?","  Steady state accretion discs larger than ~ 0.01-0.1 pc are known to be
gravitationally unstable for the accretion rates needed to explain
super-massive black hole (SMBH) activity. We propose that SMBH are fed by a
succession of mass deposition events with randomly directed angular momenta.
Because of incomplete angular momentum cancellation a warped accretion disc
forms in the inner few parsec. The orientation of the disc performs a random
walk. Deposition of new material promotes SMBH accretion at rates much faster
than viscous. Observational implications of this picture include: (i) lighter
accretion discs that can fuel AGN and quasars and yet avoid star formation at R
>> 0.1 pc; (ii) star formation inside the disc is not a function of mass
accretion rate only. It can take place at high or low accretion rates, e.g.,
when too few clouds arrive in the inner region. An example of this might be the
central parsec of our Galaxy. (iii) The discs can form Compton-thick obscuring
structures of ~ parsec size as required in AGN unification models; (iv) faster
black hole growth resulting from misalignment of the disc and the black hole
spin in the early Universe; (v) Isotropic deposition of SMBH energy and
momentum feedback in the galaxy bulge. This may help explain the high
efficiency with which it seems to be operating in the Universe. (vi) No
correlation between SMBH activity and the presence of kiloparsec scale bars or
gaseous discs in galactic bulges; (vii) Bodily collisions between gaseous
components of merging galaxies facilitate production of gas streams feeding the
centre of the combined galaxy. Mergers should thus be catalysts of SMBH growth.
(viii) Conversely, galaxies experiencing fewer mergers are more likely to form
massive nuclear star clusters than feed their SMBHs.
"
What are the roles of the Agile Measurement Index in the Agile Adoption Framework?,"  Many organizations aspire to adopt agile processes to take advantage of the
numerous benefits that it offers to an organization. Those benefits include,
but are not limited to, quicker return on investment, better software quality,
and higher customer satisfaction. To date however, there is no structured
process (at least in the public domain) that guides organizations in adopting
agile practices. To address this problem we present the Agile Adoption
Framework. The framework consists of two components: an agile measurement
index, and a 4-Stage process, that together guide and assist the agile adoption
efforts of organizations. More specifically, the agile measurement index is
used to identify the agile potential of projects and organizations. The 4-Stage
process, on the other hand, helps determine (a) whether or not organizations
are ready for agile adoption, and (b) guided by their potential, what set of
agile practices can and should be introduced.
"
What are the implications of the charge shift in black hole solutions for the 5D black hole?,"  We construct spinning black hole solutions in five dimensions that take into
account the mixed gauge-gravitational Chern-Simons term and its supersymmetric
completion. The resulting entropy formula is discussed from several points of
view. We include a Taub-NUT base space in order to test recent conjectures
relating 5D black holes to 4D black holes and the topological string. Our
explicit results show that certain charge shifts have to be taken into account
for these relations to hold. We also compute corrections to the entropy of
black rings in terms of near horizon data.
"
What are the implications of the in-degree distribution for the attractiveness of a network?,"  We compute the stationary in-degree probability, $P_{in}(k)$, for a growing
network model with directed edges and arbitrary out-degree probability. In
particular, under preferential linking, we find that if the nodes have a light
tail (finite variance) out-degree distribution, then the corresponding
in-degree one behaves as $k^{-3}$. Moreover, for an out-degree distribution
with a scale invariant tail, $P_{out}(k)\sim k^{-\alpha}$, the corresponding
in-degree distribution has exactly the same asymptotic behavior only if
$2<\alpha<3$ (infinite variance). Similar results are obtained when
attractiveness is included. We also present some results on descriptive
statistics measures %descriptive statistics such as the correlation between the
number of in-going links, $D_{in}$, and outgoing links, $D_{out}$, and the
conditional expectation of $D_{in}$ given $D_{out}$, and we calculate these
measures for the WWW network. Finally, we present an application to the
scientific publications network. The results presented here can explain the
tail behavior of in/out-degree distribution observed in many real networks.
"
What is the system of reaction-diffusion equations for morphogenesis?,"  This article is concerned with the stability and long-time dynamics of
structures arising from a structureless state. The paradigm is suggested by
developmental biology, where morphogenesis is thought to result from a
competition between chemical reactions and spatial diffusion. A system of two
reaction-diffusion equations for the concentrations of two morphogens is
reduced to a finite system of ordinary differential equations. The stability of
bifurcated solutions of this system is analyzed, and the long-time asymptotic
behavior of the bifurcated solutions is established rigorously. The
Schnakenberg and Gierer-Meinhardt equations are discussed as examples.
"
What is the control landscape of a bichromatically driven double well in the presence of strong fields?,"  We numerically construct and study the control landscape of a
$(\omega,2\omega)$ bichromatically driven double well in the presence of strong
fields. The control landscape is obtained by correlating the overlap
intensities between the floquet states and an initial phase space coherent
state with the parametric motion of the quasienergies {\it i.e.,}
intensity-level velocity correlator. ""Walls"" of no control, robust under
variations of the relative phase between the fields, are seen in the control
landscape and associated with multilevel interactions involving chaotic floquet
states.
"
"What are the theorems of Foata and Sch\""utzenberger related to Coxeter groups of type B and D?","  We generalize some identities and q-identities previously known for the
symmetric group to Coxeter groups of type B and D. The extended results include
theorems of Foata and Sch\""utzenberger, Gessel, and Roselle on various
distributions of inversion number, major index, and descent number. In order to
show our results we provide caracterizations of the systems of minimal coset
representatives of Coxeter groups of type B and D.
"
What are the results on real algebraic structures that can be obtained using real algebraic tools?,"  Using the Cartan-Kahler theory, and results on real algebraic structures, we
prove two embedding theorems. First, the interior of a smooth, compact
3-manifold may be isometrically embedded into a G_2-manifold as an associative
submanifold. Second, the interior of a smooth, compact 4-manifold K, whose
double has a trivial bundle of self-dual 2-forms, may be isometrically embedded
into a Spin(7)-manifold as a Cayley submanifold. Along the way, we also show
that Bochner's Theorem on real analytic approximation of smooth differential
forms, can be obtained using real algebraic tools developed by Akbulut and
King.
"
What is the dual of a space of sections of a Riemann surface of positive genus?,"  For a compact Riemann surface X of positive genus, the space of sections of
certain theta bundle on moduli of bundles of rank r and level k admits a
natural map to (the dual of) a similar space of sections of rank k and level r
(the strange duality isomorphism). Both sides of the isomorphism carry
projective connections as X varies in a family. We prove that this map is
(projectively) flat.
"
What is the concept of a Valdivia compact group in relation to a product of metrizable compacta?,"  It is shown that every Valdivia compact group is homeomorphic to a product of
metrizable compacta.
"
What is the relationship between the Lucas-Washburn and the square root of time?,"  We present measurements on the spontaneous imbibition (capillary rise) of
water, a linear hydrocarbon (n-C16H34) and a liquid crystal (8OCB) into the
pore space of monolithic, nanoporous Vycor glass (mean pore radius 5 nm).
Measurements on the mass uptake of the porous hosts as a function of time,
m(t), are in good agreement with the Lucas-Washburn square root of time
prediction, typical of imbibition of liquids into porous hosts. The relative
capillary rise velocities scale as expected from the bulk fluid parameters.
"
What is the effect of dark matter subhalos on the escape of compact binaries from their host galaxies in a galaxy cluster?,"  One of the possible origins of short gamma-ray bursts (SGRBs) is merging of
compact binaries, and the effect of large kick velocity is a signature that can
be used as an observational test for this hypothesis. Intracluster SGRBs that
escaped from a host galaxy in a galaxy cluster are interesting in this context,
since they would escape more easily by cluster tidal force, and would have
brighter afterglow luminosity by dense intracluster gas, than those in general
field galaxies. Here we calculate the escape fraction of compact binaries from
their host galaxies in a galaxy cluster, and discuss some observational
implications. We found that the escape fraction strongly depends on the nature
of dark matter subhalos associated with member galaxies. If the amount of dark
matter around member galaxies is not large and the gravitational potential for
an escaping binary is determined mostly by stellar mass, most of SGRBs should
escape and be observed as hostless, which is a much higher fraction than those
in the field. Hence, statistics of intracluster SGRBs could give important
information about the dark matter distribution in galaxy clusters, as well as
hints for the origin of SGRBs.
"
"What is the preferred scenario for the supernova remnant RX J0852.0-4622, and why is it preferred?","  Explicitly time-dependent, nonlinear kinetic theory of cosmic ray (CR)
acceleration in supernova remnants (SNRs) has been used to investigate the
properties of the very large SNR RX J0852.0-4622. The available observations do
not clearly distinguish between a ``nearby'' (at $\sim 200$ pc) and a
``distant'' (at $\sim 1$ kpc) source scenario. Therefore two correspondingly
different models were analyzed. While the 200 pc solution can not be a priory
excluded, the 1 kpc solution turns out to be clearly preferable for physical
reasons. It requires a core collapse supernova (SN) with a massive progenitor
in a molecular cloud $\sim 4000$ yrs ago. The overall synchrotron spectrum and
the filamentary structures in hard X-rays both consistently lead to an
amplified magnetic field $B > 100 \mu$G in the SNR interior. This implies a
suppression of the leptonic TeV $\gamma$-ray emission to about 1 percent of the
flux measured by the H.E.S.S. telescope system which therefore must be
hadronic, consistent with the theoretical solution. Up to the present the 1 kpc
solution has already converted $\sim 10$ percent of the explosion energy into
nonthermal energy, as expected for a Galactic CR source. Also the derived
$\gamma$-ray morphology is consistent with the H.E.S.S. measurements. For the
``nearby'' solution the leptonic and hadronic $\gamma$ ray fluxes are in the
ratio 1:10 which means that this case is also hadronically dominated. However,
the magnetic field strength, consistent with the overall synchrotron spectrum,
differs significantly from that derived from the X-ray filaments. Finally, the
total mechanical energy released amounts to only $1.8 \times 10^{50}$ erg,
uncomfortably low even for a core collapse event.
"
What is the family of knots and links arising from a single round of recombination?,"  We develop a topological model of knots and links arising from a single (or
multiple processive) round(s) of recombination starting with an unknot, unlink,
or (2,m)-torus knot or link substrate. We show that all knotted or linked
products fall into a single family, and prove that the size of this family
grows linearly with the cube of the minimum number of crossings. Additionally,
we prove that the only possible products of an unknot substrate are either
clasp knots and links or (2,m)-torus knots and links. Finally, in the (common)
case of (2,m)-torus knot or link substrates whose products have minimal
crossing number m+1, we prove that the types of products are tightly
prescribed, and use this to examine previously uncharacterized experimental
data.
"
How does the clumping affect the mass-loss rate and the terminal velocity of O-type stars?,"  We study the influence of clumping on the predicted wind structure of O-type
stars. For this purpose we artificially include clumping into our stationary
wind models. When the clumps are assumed to be optically thin, the radiative
line force increases compared to corresponding unclumped models, with a similar
effect on either the mass-loss rate or the terminal velocity (depending on the
onset of clumping). Optically thick clumps, alternatively, might be able to
decrease the radiative force.
"
What is the method to tune the orientation of in-plane magnetic domains and domain walls in ferromagnetic strips?,"  We report on a method to tune the orientation of in-plane magnetic domains
and domain walls in thin ferromagnetic strips by manipulating the magnetic
anisotropy. Uniaxial in-plane anisotropy is induced in a controlled way by
oblique evaporation of magnetic thin strips. A direct correlation between the
magnetization direction and the domain wall orientation is found experimentally
and confirmed by micromagnetic simulations. The domain walls in the strips are
always oriented along the oblique evaporation-induced easy axis, in spite of
the shape anisotropy. The controlled manipulation of domain wall orientations
could open new possibilities for novel devices based on domain-wall
propagation.
"
What is the structure of the spectrum of a two-level quantum system weakly coupled to a boson field?,"  We study the structure of the spectrum of a two-level quantum system weakly
coupled to a boson field (spin-boson model). Our analysis allows to avoid the
cutoff in the number of bosons, if their spectrum is bounded below by a
positive constant. We show that, for small coupling constant, the lower part of
the spectrum of the spin-boson Hamiltonian contains (one or two) isolated
eigenvalues and (respectively, one or two) manifolds of atom $+ 1$-boson states
indexed by the boson momentum $q$. The dispersion laws and generalized
eigenfunctions of the latter are calculated.
"
"What is the iron abundance in the inner Galactic bulge at (l,b) = (0°,-1°)?","  We report the first abundance analysis of 17 M giant stars in the inner
Galactic bulge at $(l,b)=(0\deg,-1\deg)$, based on $R=25,000$ infrared
spectroscopy $(1.5-1.8 ~\mu \rm m)$ using NIRSPEC at the Keck telescope. Based
on their luminosities and radial velocities, we identify these stars with a
stellar population older than 1 Gyr. We find the iron abundance $\rm < [Fe/H] >
= -0.22 \pm 0.03$, with a $1\sigma$ dispersion of $0.14\pm 0.024$. We also find
the bulge stars have enhanced [$\rm alpha$/Fe] abundance ratio at the level of
+0.3 dex relative to the Solar stars, and low $\rm <^{12}C/^{13}C>\approx
6.5\pm 0.3$. The derived iron abundance and composition for this inner bulge
sample is indistinguishable from that of a sample of M giants our team has
previously studied in Baade's Window $(l,b)=(0.9,-4)$. We find no evidence of
any major iron abundance or abundance ratio gradient between this inner field
and Baade's window.
"
What is the realization of a 5 MHz frequency difference x10 pre-multiplier?,"  This paper reports the realization of a 5 MHz frequency difference x10
pre-multiplier, developed in the laboratory to replace an obsolete one. The
principle we chose is to synthesize a 45 MHz and a 50 MHz from a reference
signal and from the signal to be measured, and to subtract one to the other to
generate a 5 MHz, whose precision on the measurement is increased by a factor
10. Obtained Allan variance &#61555;y(&#61556;) at 1 s is 5.10-14 and output
spectral density of phase noise floor is about -160 dBc/Hz at 5 MHz.
"
What is the non-relativistic limit of the linear wave equation for zero and unity spin bosons of mass $m$ in the Duffin-Kemmer-Petiau representation?,"  The non-relativistic limit of the linear wave equation for zero and unity
spin bosons of mass $m$ in the Duffin-Kemmer-Petiau representation is
investigated by means of a unitary transformation, analogous to the
Foldy-Wouthuysen canonical transformation for a relativistic electron. The
interacting case is also analyzed, by considering a power series expansion of
the transformed Hamiltonian, thus demonstrating that all features of particle
dynamics can be recovered if corrections of order $1/m^{2}$ are taken into
account through a recursive iteration procedure.
"
What is the mechanical behavior of platinum monatomic chains investigated by a newly developed technique?,"  The mechanical properties of platinum monatomic chains were investigated by
simultaneous measurement of an effective stiffness and the conductance using
our newly developed mechanically controllable break junction (MCBJ) technique
with a tuning fork as a force sensor. When stretching a monatomic contact
(two-atom chain), the stiffness and conductance increases at the early stage of
stretching and then decreases just before breaking, which is attributed to a
transition of the chain configuration and bond weakening. A statistical
analysis was made to investigate the mechanical properties of monatomic chains.
The average stiffness shows minima at the peak positions of the
length-histogram. From this result we conclude that the peaks in the
length-histogram are a measure of the number of atoms in the chains, and that
the chains break from a strained state. Additionally, we find that the smaller
the initial stiffness of the chain is, the longer the chain becomes. This shows
that softer chains can be stretched longer.
"
What is the aim of the photometry campaign in the globular cluster M4?,"  To expand the range in the colour-magnitude diagram where asteroseismology
can be applied, we organized a photometry campaign to find evidence for
solar-like oscillations in giant stars in the globular cluster M4. The aim was
to detect the comb-like p-mode structure characteristic for solar-like
oscillations in the amplitude spectra. The two dozen main target stars are in
the region of the bump stars and have luminosities in the range 50-140 Lsun. We
collected 6160 CCD frames and light curves for about 14000 stars were
extracted. We obtain high quality light curves for the K giants, but no clear
oscillation signal is detected. High precision differential photometry is
possible even in very crowded regions like the core of M4. Solar-like
oscillations are probably present in K giants, but the amplitudes are lower
than classical scaling laws predict.
"
What do galaxy formation models predict about the evolution of galaxy luminosity density over time?,"  Recent galaxy formation models successfully reproduce the local luminosity
function (LF) of galaxies by invoking mechanisms to suppress star formation in
low- and high-mass galaxies. As these models are optimized to fit the LF at low
redshift, a crucial question is how well they predict the LF at earlier times.
Here we compare recently measured rest-frame V-band LFs of galaxies at
redshifts 2.0<z<3.3 to predictions of semianalytic models by De Lucia & Blaizot
and Bower et al. and hydrodynamic simulations by Dave et al.. The models
succeed for some luminosity and redshift ranges and fail for others. A notable
success is that the Bower et al. model provides a good match to the observed LF
at z~3. However, all models predict an increase with time of the rest-frame
V-band luminosity density, whereas the observations show a decrease. The models
also have difficulty matching the observed rest-frame colors of galaxies. In
all models the luminosity density of red galaxies increases sharply from z~3 to
z~2.2, whereas it is approximately constant in the observations. Conversely, in
the models the luminosity density of blue galaxies is approximately constant,
whereas it decreases in the observations. These discrepancies cannot be
entirely remedied by changing the treatment of dust and suggest that current
models do not yet provide a complete description of galaxy formation and
evolution since z~3.
"
What is the observed brightness statistics of neutral hydrogen in the Milky Way-like galaxy?,"  Simulations of an isolated Milky Way-like galaxy, in which supernovae power a
galactic fountain, reproduce the observed velocity and 21cm brightness
statistics of galactic neutral hydrogen (HI). The simulated galaxy consists of
a thin HI disk, similar in extent and brightness to that observed in the Milky
Way, and extra-planar neutral gas at a range of velocities due to the galactic
fountain. Mock observations of the neutral gas resemble the HI flux
measurements from the Leiden-Argentine-Bonn (LAB) HI, survey, including a
high-velocity tail which matches well with observations of high-velocity
clouds. The simulated high-velocity clouds are typically found close to the
galactic disk, with a typical line-of-sight distance of 13kpc from observers on
the solar circle. The fountain efficiently cycles matter from the centre of the
galaxy to its outskirts at a rate of around 0.5 M_sun/yr
"
What are the implications of the security of QSS schemes for sharing not only a private key but also an unknown quantum state?,"  Security of the three-party quantum secret sharing (QSS) schemes based on
entanglement and a collective eavesdropping check is analyzed in the case of
considerable quantum channel losses. An opaque attack scheme is presented for
the dishonest agent to eavesdrop the message obtained by the other agent
freely, which reveals that these QSS schemes are insecure for transmission
efficiencies lower than 50%, especially when they are used to share an unknown
quantum state. Finally, we present a general way to improve the security of QSS
schemes for sharing not only a private key but also an unknown quantum state.
"
What are the key features of the perturbative expansion in the Parametric Perturbation Theory?,"  We present a {\sl non--perturbative} method, called {\sl Parametric
Perturbation Theory} (PPT), which is alternative to the ordinary perturbation
theory. The method relies on a principle of simplicity for the observable
solutions, which are constrained to be linear in a certain (unphysical)
parameter. The perturbative expansion is carried out in this parameter and not
in the physical coupling (as in ordinary perturbation theory). We show that the
method is capable to resum the divergent perturbative series, to {\sl extract}
the leading asymptotic (strong coupling) behavior and {\sl predict} with high
accuracy the coefficients of the perturbative series.
"
What is the relationship between the Schroedinger operator and the quantum decay rate?,"  In this article we prove that for a large class of operators, including
Schroedinger operators, with hyperbolic classical flows, the smallness of
dimension of the trapped set implies that there is a gap between the resonances
and the real axis. In other words, the quantum decay rate is bounded from below
if the classical repeller is sufficiently filamentary. The higher dimensional
statement is given in terms of the topological pressure. Under the same
assumptions we also prove a resolvent estimate with a logarithmic loss compared
to nontrapping estimates.
"
What is the composite nature of the dimers appearing only in the next order term proportional to n^2?,"  We present an exact theory of the BEC-BCS crossover in the BEC regime, which
treats explicitely dimers as made of two fermions. We apply our framework, at
zero temperature, to the calculation of the equation of state. We find that,
when expanding the chemical potential in powers of the density n up to the
Lee-Huang-Yang order, proportional to n^3/2, the result is identical to the one
of elementary bosons in terms of the dimer-dimer scattering length a_M, the
composite nature of the dimers appearing only in the next order term
proportional to n^2 .
"
What are the CNOT operations used in the quantum cloning machine?,"  We propose a scheme to realize $1\to 2$ universal quantum cloning machine
(UQCM) with superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) qubits, embeded
in a high-Q cavity. CNOT operations are derived to present our scheme, and the
two-photon Raman resonance processes are used to increase the operation rate.
Compared with previous works, our scheme has advantages in the experimental
realization and further utilization.
"
What is the relationship between the expected number of bit comparisons and the number of keys?,"  When algorithms for sorting and searching are applied to keys that are
represented as bit strings, we can quantify the performance of the algorithms
not only in terms of the number of key comparisons required by the algorithms
but also in terms of the number of bit comparisons. Some of the standard
sorting and searching algorithms have been analyzed with respect to key
comparisons but not with respect to bit comparisons. In this paper, we
investigate the expected number of bit comparisons required by Quickselect
(also known as Find). We develop exact and asymptotic formulae for the expected
number of bit comparisons required to find the smallest or largest key by
Quickselect and show that the expectation is asymptotically linear with respect
to the number of keys. Similar results are obtained for the average case. For
finding keys of arbitrary rank, we derive an exact formula for the expected
number of bit comparisons that (using rational arithmetic) requires only finite
summation (rather than such operations as numerical integration) and use it to
compute the expectation for each target rank.
"
What is the entanglement of continuous positive definite functions on products of compact groups?,"  We define and study entanglement of continuous positive definite functions on
products of compact groups. We formulate and prove an infinite-dimensional
analog of Horodecki Theorem, giving a necessary and sufficient criterion for
separability of such functions. The resulting characterisation is given in
terms of mappings of the space of continuous functions, preserving positive
definiteness. The relation between the developed group-theoretical formalism
and the conventional one, given in terms of density matrices, is established
through the non-commutative Fourier analysis.
"
What are the implications of alternative logics on the scientific,"  This article discusses two books on the topic of alternative logics in
science: ""Deviant Logic"", by Susan Haack, and ""Alternative Logics: Do Sciences
Need Them?"", edited by Paul Weingartner.
"
What is the influence of aerosol module parameterizations on aerosol concentrations in the MICS2 intercomparison study?,"  In the framework of the model inter-comparison study - Asia Phase II (MICS2),
where eight models are compared over East Asia, this paper studies the
influence of different parameterizations used in the aerosol module on the
aerosol concentrations of sulfate and nitrate in PM10. An intracomparison of
aerosol concentrations is done for March 2001 using different configurations of
the aerosol module of one of the model used for the intercomparison. Single
modifications of a reference setup for model configurations are performed and
compared to a reference case. These modifications concern the size
distribution, i.e. the number of sections, and physical processes, i.e.
coagulation, condensation/evaporation, cloud chemistry, heterogeneous reactions
and sea-salt emissions. Comparing monthly averaged concentrations at different
stations, the importance of each parameterization is first assessed. It is
found that sulfate concentrations are little sensitive to sea-salt emissions
and to whether condensation is computed dynamically or by assuming
thermodynamic equilibrium. Nitrate concentrations are little sensitive to cloud
chemistry. However, a very high sensitivity to heterogeneous reactions is
observed. Thereafter, the variability of the aerosol concentrations to the use
of different chemistry transport models (CTMs) and the variability to the use
of different parameterizations in the aerosol module are compared. For sulfate,
the variability to the use of different parameterizations in the aerosol module
is lower than the variability to the use of different CTMs. However, for
nitrate, for monthly averaged concentrations averaged over four stations, these
two variabilities have the same order of magnitude.
"
What is the effect of a peculiar motion with respect to the Hubble flow on the mass estimate of a cluster?,"  Gravitational lensing provides an efficient tool for the investigation of
matter structures, independent of the dynamical or hydrostatic equilibrium
properties of the deflecting system. However, it depends on the kinematic
status. In fact, either a translational motion or a coherent rotation of the
mass distribution can affect the lensing properties. Here, light deflection by
galaxy clusters in motion is considered. Even if gravitational lensing mass
measurements of galaxy clusters are regarded as very reliable estimates, the
kinematic effect should be considered. A typical peculiar motion with respect
to the Hubble flow brings about a systematic error < 0.3%, independent of the
mass of the cluster. On the other hand, the effect of the spin increases with
the total mass. For cluster masses ~ 10^{15}M_{sun}, the effect of the
gravitomagnetic term is < 0.04% on strong lensing estimates and < 0.5% in the
weak lensing analyses. The total kinematic effect on the mass estimate is then
< 1%, which is negligible in current statistical studies. In the weak lensing
regime, the rotation imprints a typical angular modulation in the tangential
shear distortion. This would allow in principle a detection of the
gravitomagnetic field and a direct measurement of the angular velocity of the
cluster but the required background source densities are well beyond current
tecnological capabilities.
"
What is the population fraction of a genotype obtained within the quasispecies model and the shell model?,"  We consider an asexual population evolving on rugged fitness landscapes which
are defined on the multi-dimensional genotypic space and have many local
optima. We track the most populated genotype as it changes when the population
jumps from a fitness peak to a better one during the process of adaptation.
This is done using the dynamics of the shell model which is a simplified
version of the quasispecies model for infinite populations and standard
Wright-Fisher dynamics for large finite populations. We show that the
population fraction of a genotype obtained within the quasispecies model and
the shell model match for fit genotypes and at short times, but the dynamics of
the two models are identical for questions related to the most populated
genotype. We calculate exactly several properties of the jumps in infinite
populations some of which were obtained numerically in previous works. We also
present our preliminary simulation results for finite populations. In
particular, we measure the jump distribution in time and find that it decays as
$t^{-2}$ as in the quasispecies problem.
"
What is the relationship between the medium-independent and medium-dependent contributions to the two-body interaction?,"  By examining the structure in momentum and coordinate space of a two-body
interaction spherically symmetric in its local coordinate, we demonstrate that
it can be disentangled into two distinctive contributions. One of them is a
medium-independent and momentum-conserving term, whereas the other is
functionally --and exclusively-- proportional to the radial derivative of the
reduced matrix element. As example, this exact result was applied to the
unabridged optical potential in momentum space, leading to an explicit
separation between the medium-free and medium-dependent contributions. The
latter does not depend on the strength of the reduced effective interaction but
only on its variations with respect to the density. The modulation of radial
derivatives of the density enhances the effect in the surface and suppresses it
in the saturated volume. The generality of this result may prove to be useful
for the study of surface-sensitive phenomena.
"
What is the current understanding of the parton structure of the nucleon and its implications for colliders?,"  An overview is given of recent progress on a variety of fronts in the global
QCD analysis of the parton structure of the nucleon and its implication for
collider phenomenology, carried out by various subgroups of the CTEQ
collaboration.
"
What is the relationship between the dilaton potential and the dilaton in the effective field theory?,"  We discuss an effective field theory background containing the gravitational
field, the dilaton and a closed string tachyon, and couple this background to a
gas of fundamental strings and D strings. Allowing for the possibility of a
non-vanishing dilaton potential of Casimir type, we demonstrate the possibility
of obtaining a nonsingular, static tachyon condensate phase with fixed dilaton.
The time reversal of our solution provides a candidate effective field theory
description of a Hagedorn phase of string gas cosmology with fixed dilaton.
"
What is the use of rockets in relation to the event horizon of a black hole?,"  It has long been known that once you cross the event horizon of a black hole,
your destiny lies at the central singularity, irrespective of what you do.
Furthermore, your demise will occur in a finite amount of proper time. In this
paper, the use of rockets in extending the amount of time before the collision
with the central singularity is examined. In general, the use of such rockets
can increase your remaining time, but only up to a maximum value; this is at
odds with the ``more you struggle, the less time you have'' statement that is
sometimes discussed in relation to black holes. The derived equations are
simple to solve numerically and the framework can be employed as a teaching
tool for general relativity.
"
What are the results of the analysis of electron localization in two coupled quantum dots?,"  Analysis of quantum dot structures is a current topic with important
applications in solid-state digital logic design, quantum information
technology and quantum optics. In this work, we show a variational formulation
for the solution of the effective two-level approach of the analysis of
electron localization in two coupled quantum dots. Numerical results are
presented as well the use of electron localization in the realization of a
configurable logic circuit using quantum-dot cellular automata.
"
What are the implications of the addition of sterile neutrinos on the predictions of mass-related observables in the MiniBooNE and LSND experiments?,"  The MiniBooNE and LSND experiments are compatible with each other when two
sterile neutrinos are added to the three active ones. In this case there are
eight possible mass orderings. In two of them both sterile neutrinos are
heavier than the three active ones. In the next two scenarios both sterile
neutrinos are lighter than the three active ones. The remaining four scenarios
have one sterile neutrino heavier and another lighter than the three active
ones. We analyze all scenarios with respect to their predictions for
mass-related observables. These are the sum of neutrino masses as constrained
by cosmological observations, the kinematic mass parameter as measurable in the
KATRIN experiment, and the effective mass governing neutrinoless double beta
decay. It is investigated how these non-oscillation probes can distinguish
between the eight scenarios. Six of the eight possible mass orderings predict
positive signals in the KATRIN and future neutrinoless double beta decay
experiments. We also remark on scenarios with three sterile neutrinos. In
addition we make some comments on the possibility of using decays of high
energy astrophysical neutrinos to discriminate between the mass orderings in
presence of two sterile neutrinos.
"
What are the differences between the phase behavior of mixtures of soft repulsive spheres and hard spheres?,"  We consider binary mixtures of soft repulsive spherical particles and
calculate the depletion interaction between two big spheres mediated by the
fluid of small spheres, using different theoretical and simulation methods. The
validity of the theoretical approach, a virial expansion in terms of the
density of the small spheres, is checked against simulation results. Attention
is given to the approach toward the hard-sphere limit, and to the effect of
density and temperature on the strength of the depletion potential. Our results
indicate, surprisingly, that even a modest degree of softness in the pair
potential governing the direct interactions between the particles may lead to a
significantly more attractive total effective potential for the big spheres
than in the hard-sphere case. This might lead to significant differences in
phase behavior, structure and dynamics of a binary mixture of soft repulsive
spheres. In particular, a perturbative scheme is applied to predict the phase
diagram of an effective system of big spheres interacting via depletion forces
for a size ratio of small and big spheres of 0.2; this diagram includes the
usual fluid-solid transition but, in the soft-sphere case, the metastable
fluid-fluid transition, which is probably absent in hard-sphere mixtures, is
close to being stable with respect to direct fluid-solid coexistence. From
these results the interesting possibility arises that, for sufficiently soft
repulsive particles, this phase transition could become stable. Possible
implications for the phase behavior of real colloidal dispersions are
discussed.
"
What is the effect of stellar-mass black holes on the scattering of black holes in cluster halos?,"  We present the results of realistic N-body modelling of massive star clusters
in the Magellanic Clouds, aimed at investigating a dynamical origin for the
radius-age trend observed in these systems. We find that stellar-mass black
holes, formed in the supernova explosions of the most massive cluster stars,
can constitute a dynamically important population. If a significant number of
black holes are retained (here we assume complete retention), these objects
rapidly form a dense core where interactions are common, resulting in the
scattering of black holes into the cluster halo, and the ejection of black
holes from the cluster. These two processes heat the stellar component,
resulting in prolonged core expansion of a magnitude matching the observations.
Significant core evolution is also observed in Magellanic Cloud clusters at
early times. We find that this does not result from the action of black holes,
but can be reproduced by the effects of mass-loss due to rapid stellar
evolution in a primordially mass segregated cluster.
"
What is the intrinsic definition of the fundamental group of a linear category over a ring as the automorphism group of the fibre functor on Galois coverings?,"  We provide an intrinsic definition of the fundamental group of a linear
category over a ring as the automorphism group of the fibre functor on Galois
coverings. If the universal covering exists, we prove that this group is
isomorphic to the Galois group of the universal covering. The grading deduced
from a Galois covering enables us to describe the canonical monomorphism from
its automorphism group to the first Hochschild-Mitchell cohomology vector
space.
"
What are the implications of the large equivalent widths of Ly-alpha sources for their young ages?,"  Spatially extended Ly-alpha sources that are faint and/or compact in coninuum
are candidates for extremely young (~< 10^7 yrs) galaxies at high redshifts. We
present medium-resolution (R~2000) spectroscopy of such extended Ly-alpha
sources found in our previous study at z~3-5, using VLT/VIMOS. The deep
spectroscopy showed that all 18 objects we observed have large equivalent
widths (EWs) exceeding 100 A. For about 30% of our sample (five objects), we
identified conspicuous asymmetry on the profiles of the Ly-alpha line. They
show broad wing emission components on the red side, and sharp cut-off on the
blue side of the Ly-alpha line. Such asymmetry is often seen in superwind
galaxies known to date, and also consistent with a theoretical prediction of
superwind activity. There are eight objects (8/18 ~ 40%) that have large EWs
exceeding 200 A, and no clear signature of superwind activities. Such large EWs
cannot be explained in terms of photo-ionization by a moderately old (>10^7
yrs) stellar population, even with a top-heavy IMF or an extremely low
metallicity. These eight objects clearly show a positive correlation between
the Ly-alpha luminosity and the velocity width. This suggests that these eight
objects are good candidates for forming-galaxies in a gas-cooling phase.
"
What is the expression of the expected conditional response time for the BPS queue?,"  We study Batch Processor-Sharing (BPS) queuing model with hyper-exponential
service time distribution and Poisson batch arrival process. One of the main
goals to study BPS is the possibility of its application in size-based
scheduling, which is used in differentiation between Short and Long flows in
the Internet. In the case of hyper-exponential service time distribution we
find an analytical expression of the expected conditional response time for the
BPS queue. We show, that the expected conditional response time is a concave
function of the service time. We apply the received results to the Two Level
Processor-Sharing (TLPS) model with hyper-exponential service time distribution
and find the expression of the expected response time for the TLPS model. TLPS
scheduling discipline can be applied to size-based differentiation in TCP/IP
networks and Web server request handling.
"
What is the relationship between the set of closed half planes and the higher rank numerical range of matrices?,"  Results on matrix canonical forms are used to give a complete description of
the higher rank numerical range of matrices arising from the study of quantum
error correction. It is shown that the set can be obtained as the intersection
of closed half planes (of complex numbers). As a result, it is always a convex
set in $\mathcal C$. Moreover, the higher rank numerical range of a normal
matrix is a convex polygon determined by the eigenvalues. These two
consequences confirm the conjectures of Choi et al. on the subject. In
addition, the results are used to derive a formula for the optimal upper bound
for the dimension of a totally isotropic subspace of a square matrix, and
verify the solvability of certain matrix equations.
"
What is the new technique for generating minimally coupled Einstein-scalar field solutions in 4 dimensions?,"  This paper generalizes two previously known techniques for generating
minimally coupled Einstein-scalar field solutions in 4 dimensions; the Buchdahl
and Fonarev transformations. By applying this solution generation technique,
minimally coupled Einstein-scalar field solutions can be generated from vacuum
solutions with arbitrary cosmological constant in arbitrary dimension. The only
requirement to a seed solution is that it posesses a hypersurface-orthogonal
Killing vector field. The generalization that allows us to use seed solutions
with arbitrary cosmological constant uncovers a new class of Einstein-scalar
field solutions that has previously not been studied. We apply the new solution
transformation to the (A)dS4 vacuum solution. Transforming the resulting
Einstein-scalar field solution to the conformal frame, a two-parameter family
of spatially finite, expanding and accelerating cosmological solutions are
found that are conformally isometric to the Einstein static universe RxS^3. We
study null geodesics and find that for any observer, the solution has a
cosmological horizon at an angular distance of pi/2 away from the observer. We
find that a subset of these solutions can be naturally interpreted as expanding
cosmologies in which a scalar black hole is formed at late times. The
conformally coupled scalar field satisfies the weak energy condition as long as
the energy density is positive, while the strong energy condition is generally
violated.
"
What is the theorem of Singhof that determines the classical Lusternik-Schnirelmann category for U(n) and SU(n)?,"  We will provide a lower bound for the equivariant Lusternik-Schnirelmann
category of an arbitrary proper action in terms of the stratification by orbit
types, and an upper bound for proper polar actions in terms of the equivariant
Lusternik-Schnirelmann category of its generalized Weyl group. As an
application we reprove a theorem of Singhof that determines the classical
Lusternik-Schnirelmann category for U(n) and SU(n).
"
What are the varieties with a nef tangent bundle that satisfy Murre's conjectures?,"  In this paper, we investigate Murre's conjectures on the structure of
rational Chow groups and exhibit explicit Chow--Kuenneth projectors for some
examples. More precisely, the examples we study are the varieties which have a
nef tangent bundle. For surfaces and threefolds which have a nef tangent bundle
explicit Chow--Kuenneth projectors are obtained which satisfy Murre's
conjectures and the motivic Hard Lefschetz theorem is verified.
"
What are the characteristic tools of the noncommutative infinitesimal calculus used to define a d-energy functional?,"  The aim of the present work is to show how, using the differential calculus
associated to Dirichlet forms, it is possible to construct Fredholm modules on
post critically finite fractals by regular harmonic structures. The modules are
d-summable, the summability exponent d coinciding with the spectral dimension
of the generalized laplacian operator associated with the regular harmonic
structures. The characteristic tools of the noncommutative infinitesimal
calculus allow to define a d-energy functional which is shown to be a
self-similar conformal invariant.
"
What is a generalization of the argument principle for holomorphic mappings from the standard complex disc to a complex manifold?,"  Let $\Omega$ be a smooth real analytic submanifold of a complex manifold $X$.
We establish and study the link between the following 3 subjects: 1)
topological properties of smooth families of attached analytic discs, the
manifold $\Omega$ admits, 2) lower bounds for dimensions of complex tangent
spaces of $\Omega$, 3) a generalization of the argument principle for smooth
families of holomorphic mappings from the standard complex disc to $X$.
  In particular, we obtain characterization of complex manifolds and their
boundaries in terms of attached analytic discs. The special case when $\Omega$
is the graph, leads to new characterizations of holomorphic and $CR$ functions,
and in particular, to solutions of some open problems about such functions.
"
What is the Robertson-Walker Universe described by a conformal mechanical system?,"  Using a novel, string theory-inspired formalism based on a Hamiltonian
constraint, we obtain a conformal mechanical system for the spatially flat
four-dimensional Robertson-Walker Universe. Depending on parameter choices,
this system describes either a relativistic particle in the Robertson-Walker
background, or metric fluctuations of the Robertson-Walker geometry. Moreover
we derive a tree-level M-theory matrix model in this time-dependent background.
Imposing the Hamiltonian constraint forces the spacetime geometry to be fuzzy
near the big bang, while the classical Robertson-Walker geometry emerges as the
Universe expands. From our approach we also derive the temperature of the
Universe interpolating between the radiation and matter dominated eras.
"
What is the impact of the topology of the metabolic network on the distribution of fluxes?,"  The metabolic networks are very well characterized for a large set of
organisms, a unique case in within the large-scale biological networks. For
this reason they provide a a very interesting framework for the construction of
analytically tractable statistical mechanics models.
  In this paper we introduce a solvable model for the distribution of fluxes in
the metabolic network. We show that the effect of the topology on the
distribution of fluxes is to allow for large fluctuations of their values, a
fact that should have implications on the robustness of the system.
"
What is the theorem on the continuous dependence of a semigroup on its generator?,"  Let $\Omega$ be an operator semigroup with generator $A$ in a sequentially
complete locally convex topological vector space $E$. For a semigroup with
generator $A+D$, where $D$ is a bounded linear operator on $E$, two integral
equations are derived. A theorem on continuous dependence of a semigroup on its
generator is proved. An application to random walk on $\mathbb{Z}$ is given.
"
What is the nature of the break in the X-ray lightcurve of GRB 050802?,"  This paper investigates GRB 050802, one of the best examples of a it Swift
gamma-ray burst afterglow that shows a break in the X-ray lightcurve, while the
optical counterpart decays as a single power-law. This burst has an optically
bright afterglow of 16.5 magnitude, detected throughout the 170-650nm spectral
range of the UVOT on-board Swift. Observations began with the XRT and UVOT
telescopes 286s after the initial trigger and continued for 1.2 x 10^6s. The
X-ray lightcurve consists of three power-law segments: a rise until 420s,
followed by a slow decay with alpha_2 = 0.63 +/- 0.03 until 5000s, after which,
the lightcurve decays faster with a slope of alpha_3 = 1.59 +/- 0.03. The
optical lightcurve decays as a single power-law with alpha_O = 0.82 +/- 0.03
throughout the observation. The X-ray data on their own are consistent with the
break at 5000s being due to the end of energy injection. Modelling the optical
to X-ray spectral energy distribution, we find that the optical afterglow can
not be produced by the same component as the X-ray emission at late times,
ruling out a single component afterglow. We therefore considered two-component
jet models and find that the X-ray and optical emission is best reproduced by a
model in which both components are energy injected for the duration of the
observed afterglow and the X-ray break at 5000s is due to a jet break in the
narrow component. This bright, well-observed burst is likely a guide for
interpreting the surprising finding of Swift that bursts seldom display
achromatic jet breaks.

What are the equilibrium properties of mesoscopic quantum conductors?,"  Review article on equilibrium properties of mesoscopic quantum conductors.
"
What are the implications of the technique for cubically shaped particles?,"  We propose an extrapolation technique that allows accuracy improvement of the
discrete dipole approximation computations. The performance of this technique
was studied empirically based on extensive simulations for 5 test cases using
many different discretizations. The quality of the extrapolation improves with
refining discretization reaching extraordinary performance especially for
cubically shaped particles. A two order of magnitude decrease of error was
demonstrated. We also propose estimates of the extrapolation error, which were
proven to be reliable. Finally we propose a simple method to directly separate
shape and discretization errors and illustrated this for one test case.
"
"What is the optimal distance (r_{opt}) at which the effects on the inferred signal, S(r_{opt}), of the uncertainties on true core location, are minimized?","  The normalization constant of the lateral distribution function (LDF) of an
extensive air shower is a monotonous (almost linear) increasing function of the
energy of the primary. Therefore, the interpolated signal at some fixed
distance from the core can be calibrated to estimate the energy of the shower.
There is, somehow surprisingly, a reconstructed optimal distance, r_{opt}, at
which the effects on the inferred signal, S(r_{opt}), of the uncertainties on
true core location, LDF functional form and shower-to-shower fluctuations are
minimized. We calculate the value of r_{opt} as a function of surface detector
separation, energy and zenith angle and we demonstrate the advantage of using
the r_{opt} value of each individual shower instead of a same fixed distance
for every shower, specially in dealing with events with saturated stations. The
effects on the determined spectrum are also shown.

"
What is the Szlenk index of a Banach space?,"  For a countable ordinal a we denote by C_a the class of separable, reflexive
Banach spaces whose Szlenk index and the Szlenk index of their dual are bounded
by a. We show that each C_a admits a separable, reflexive universal space. We
also show that spaces in the class C_{omega^{a*omega}} embed into spaces of the
same class with a basis. As a consequence we deduce that each C_a is analytic
in the Effros-Borel structure of subspaces of C[0,1].
"
What is the physical mechanism of glassy arrest in a colloidal system of spheres?,"  A colloidal system of spheres interacting with both a deep and narrow
attractive potential and a shallow long-ranged barrier exhibits a prepeak in
the static structure factor. This peak can be related to an additional
mesoscopic length scale of clusters and/or voids in the system. Simulation
studies of this system have revealed that it vitrifies upon increasing the
attraction into a gel-like solid at intermediate densities. The dynamics at the
mesoscopic length scale corresponding to the prepeak represents the slowest
mode in the system. Using mode coupling theory with all input directly taken
from simulations, we reveal the mechanism for glassy arrest in the system at
40% packing fraction. The effects of the low-q peak and of polydispersity are
considered in detail. We demonstrate that the local formation of physical bonds
is the process whose slowing down causes arrest.
  It remains largely unaffected by the large-scale heterogeneities, and sets
the clock for the slow cluster mode. Results from mode-coupling theory without
adjustable parameters agree semi-quantitatively with the local density
correlators but overestimate the lifetime of the mesoscopic structure (voids).
"
What are the implications of the mean free-path of the produced (pre)hadron for the nuclear suppression RAA?,"  A new scenario, alternative to energy loss, for the observed suppression of
high-pT hadrons observed at RHIC is proposed. In the limit of a very dense
medium crated in nuclear collisions the mean free-path of the produced
(pre)hadron vanishes, and and the nuclear suppression, R_{AA} is completely
controlled by the production length. The RHIC data are well explained in a
parameter free way, and predictions for LHC are provided.
"
How do the Bianchi identities restrict the properties of type D vacuum spacetimes?,"  We show that all static spacetimes in higher dimensions are of Weyl types G,
I_i, D or O. This applies also to stationary spacetimes if additional
conditions are fulfilled, as for most known black hole/ring solutions. (The
conclusions change when the Killing generator becomes null, such as at Killing
horizons.) Next we demonstrate that the same Weyl types characterize warped
product spacetimes with a one-dimensional Lorentzian (timelike) factor, whereas
warped spacetimes with a two-dimensional Lorentzian factor are restricted to
the types D or O. By exploring the Bianchi identities, we then analyze the
simplest non-trivial case from the above classes - type D vacuum spacetimes,
possibly with a cosmological constant, dropping, however, the assumptions that
the spacetime is static, stationary or warped. It is shown that for ``generic''
type D vacuum spacetimes the corresponding principal null directions are
geodetic in any dimension (this applies also to type II spacetimes). For n>=5,
however, there may exist particular cases of type D spacetimes which admit
non-geodetic multiple principal null directions and we present such examples in
any n>=7. Further studies are restricted to five dimensions, where the type D
Weyl tensor is described by a 3x3 matrix \Phi_{ij}. In the case with
``twistfree'' (A_{ij}=0) principal null geodesics we show that in a ``generic''
case \Phi_{ij} is symmetric and eigenvectors of \Phi_{ij} coincide with those
of the expansion matrix S_{ij}, providing us with three preferred spacelike
directions of the spacetime. Similar results are also obtained when relaxing
the twistfree condition and assuming instead that \Phi_{ij} is symmetric. The
n=5 Myers-Perry black hole and Kerr-NUT-AdS metrics in arbitrary dimension are
briefly studied as specific examples of type D vacuum spacetime.
"
What is the standing wave method used to study circular orbits of compact objects?,"  The periodic standing wave method studies circular orbits of compact objects
coupled to helically symmetric standing wave gravitational fields. From this
solution an approximation is extracted for the strong field, slowly
inspiralling motion of black holes and binary stars. Previous work on this
model has dealt with nonlinear scalar models, and with linearized general
relativity. Here we present the results of the method for the post-Minkowski
(PM) approximation to general relativity, the first step beyond linearized
gravity. We compute the PM approximation in two ways: first, via the standard
approach of computing linearized gravitational fields and constructing from
them quadratic driving sources for second-order fields, and second, by solving
the second-order equations as an ``exact'' nonlinear system. The results of
these computations have two distinct applications: (i) The computational
infrastructure for the ``exact'' PM solution will be directly applicable to
full general relativity. (ii) The results will allow us to begin supplying
initial data to collaborators running general relativistic evolution codes.
"
How does the rupture time depend on the applied force and temperature?,"  We present experiments on the slow growth of a single crack in a fax paper
sheet submitted to a constant force $F$. We find that statistically averaged
crack growth curves can be described by only two parameters : the mean rupture
time $\tau$ and a characteristic growth length $\zeta$. We propose a model
based on a thermally activated rupture process that takes into account the
microstructure of cellulose fibers. The model is able to reproduce the shape of
the growth curve, the dependence of $\zeta$ on $F$ as well as the effect of
temperature on the rupture time $\tau$. We find that the length scale at which
rupture occurs in this model is consistently close to the diameter of cellulose
microfibrils.
"
What are the Hofstadter butterfly states of the MI-SF transition boundary?,"  We consider the Bose-Hubbard model in a two dimensional rotating optical
lattice and investigate the consequences of the effective magnetic field
created by rotation. Using a Gutzwiller type variational wavefunction, we find
an analytical expression for the Mott insulator(MI)-Superfluid(SF) transition
boundary in terms of the maximum eigenvalue of the Hofstadter butterfly. The
dependence of phase boundary on the effective magnetic field is complex,
reflecting the self-similar properties of the single particle energy spectrum.
Finally, we argue that fractional quantum Hall phases exist close to the MI-SF
transition boundaries, including MI states with particle densities greater than
one.
"
What is the nature of the low-energy photons produced from the galactic center?,"  Anomalous production of low-energy photons from the galactic center have
fueled speculations on the nature and properties of dark matter particles. In
particular, it has been proposed that light scalars may be responsible for the
bulk of the matter density of the universe, and that they couple to ordinary
matter through a light spin-1 boson. If this is the case, then such particles
may be produced in the quasi-elastic low-energy scattering of electrons off
protons. We present a proposal for an experiment to search for this process and
assess its viability.
"
What is the mechanism of the phase transition in MgV_2O_4?,"  On the basis of experimental thermoelectric power results and ab initio
calculations, we propose that a metal-insulator transition takes place at high
pressure (approximately 6 GPa) in MgV_2O_4.
"
What is the method proposed for determining the position and inclination angles of a spiral galaxy?,"  A method is proposed for the determination of the position and inclination
angles of the plane of a spiral galaxy based on the assumption that every
spiral arm is a monotonic function of the radius versus azimuthal angle. This
method may yield more accurate results than the more commonly employed isophote
method, which is fraught with various drawbacks. The use of the new method is
illustrated by applying it to a sample of 43 objects, and the results agree
well with data from other sources.
"
What are the implications of the zero point energy for the present time in the universe?,"  We study the cosmic time evolution of an effective quantum field theory
energy-momentum tensor T_{\mu\nu} and show that, as a consequence of the
effective nature of the theory, the structure of T_{\mu\nu} is such that the
vacuum energy decreases with time. We find that the zero point energy at
present time is washed out by the cosmological evolution. The implications of
this finding for the cosmological constant problem are investigated.
"
What happens to the Bragg resonance in a system with an asymmetry?,"  Coquelin et al. studied biperiodic semiconductor superlattices, which consist
of alternating cell types, one with wide wells and the other narrow wells,
separated by equal strength barriers. If the wells were identical, it would be
a simply periodic system of $N = 2n$ half-cells. When asymmetry is introduced,
an allowed band splits at the Bragg point into two disjoint allowed bands. The
Bragg resonance turns into a transparent state located close to the band edge
of the lower(upper) band when the first(second) well is the wider. Analysis of
this system gives insight into how band splitting occurs. Further we consider
semi-periodic systems having $N= 2n+1$ half-cells. Surprisingly these have very
different transmission properties, with an envelope of maximum transmission
probability that crosses the envelope of minima at the transparent point.
"
What are the necessary and sufficient conditions for the isogenous relation for a surface S?,"  A projective surface S is said to be isogenous to a product if there exist
two smooth curves C, F and a finite group G acting freely on C \times F so that
S=(C \times F)/G. In this paper we classify all surfaces with p_g=q=1 which are
isogenous to a product.
"
What is the concentration of damage in microfractured elastic media?,"  We want to understand he concentration of damage in microfractured elastic
media. Due to the different scallings of the volume and area (or area and
length in two dimensions) the traditional method of homogenization using
periodic arrays of cells seems to fail when applied to the Mumford-Shah
functional and to periodically fractured domains.
  In the present paper we are departing from traditional homogenization. The
main result implies the use of Mumford-Shah energies and leads to an
explanation of the observed concentration of damage in microfractured elastic
bodies.
"
What is the relationship between General Relativity and string theory?,"  We discuss how, in a Universe restricted to the causal region connected to
the observer, General Relativity implies the quantum nature of physical
phenomena and directly leads to a string theory scenario, whose dynamics is
ruled by a functional that weights all configurations according to their
entropy. The most favoured configurations are those of minimal entropy. Along
this class of vacua a four-dimensional space-time is automatically selected;
when, at large volume, a description of space-time in terms of classical
geometry can be recovered, the entropy-weighted sum reduces to the ordinary
Feynman's path integral. What arises is a highly predictive scenario,
phenomenologically compatible with the experimental observations and
measurements, in which everything is determined in terms of the fundamental
constants and the age of the Universe, with no room for freely-adjustable
parameters. We discuss how this leads to the known spectrum of particles and
interactions. Besides the computation of masses and couplings, CKM matrix
elements, cosmological constant, expansion parameters of the Universe etc...,
all resulting, within the degree of the approximation we used, in agreement
with the experimental observations, we also discuss how this scenario passes
the tests provided by cosmology and the constraints imposed by the physics of
the primordial Universe.

How do the counter terms in ChPT arise from the Wilsonian renormalization group equation?,"  In nuclear chiral perturbation theory (ChPT), an operator is defined in a
space with a cutoff which may be varied within a certain range. The operator
runs as a result of the variation of the cutoff [renormalization group (RG)
running]. In order for ChPT to be useful, the operator should run in a way
consistent with the counting rule; that is, the running of chiral counter terms
have to be of natural size. We vary the cutoff using the Wilsonian
renormalization group (WRG) equation, and examine this consistency. As an
example, we study the s-wave pion production operator for NN\to d pi, derived
in ChPT. We demonstrate that the WRG running does not generate any
chiral-symmetry-violating (CSV) interaction, provided that we start with an
operator which does not contain a CSV term. We analytically show how the
counter terms are generated in the WRG running in case of the infinitesimal
cutoff reduction. Based on the analytic result, we argue a range of the cutoff
variation for which the running of the counter terms is of natural size. Then,
we numerically confirm this.
"
What are the properties of the combined Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati (DGP) model and the Chaplygin gas model of dark energy?,"  The expansion of the Universe is accelerating, as testified by observations
of supernovae of type Ia as a function of redshift. Explanations are of two
types: modifications of Einstein gravity or new forms of energy, coined dark
energy.The accelerated expansion is explained here by a combination of
Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati (DGP) model gravity and Chaplygin gas dark energy. Both
models are characterized by a length scale L which may be the same. The
continuity equation for the combined model is derived in flat geometry, and
solved by numerical methods. The solution is shown to have the expected
properties: at very small scales (a<<L) the energy density behaves as
pressureless dust, at very large scales (a>>L) as a cosmological constant. The
modifications to the DGP model and the Chaplygin gas model occur for values of
a L. The results show an increase in the present dark energy density relative
to the plain DGP model.
"
What is the performance of space-time codes with high performance?,"  A new class of space time codes with high performance is presented. The code
design utilizes tailor-made permutation codes, which are known to have large
minimal distances as spherical codes. A geometric connection between spherical
and space time codes has been used to translate them into the final space time
codes. Simulations demonstrate that the performance increases with the block
lengths, a result that has been conjectured already in previous work. Further,
the connection to permutation codes allows for moderate complex en-/decoding
algorithms.

"What are the implications of the stripped mass, the ratio of the stripped mass to the companion mass, and the kick velocity of the companion on the spatial velocity of the companion?","  Using a simple analytic method, we calculate the impact effect between the
ejecta of a SN Ia and its companion to survey the influence of initial
parameters of the progenitor's system, which is useful for searching the
companion in a explosion remnant. The companion models are obtained from
Eggleton's evolution code.The results are divided into two groups based on mass
transfer stage. For a given condition, more hydrogen-rich material is stripped
from the envelope of a Hertzsprung-gap companion than that of a main-sequence
companion, while a larger kick velocity and a larger luminosity are gained for
a main-sequence companion. The kick velocity is too low to significantly affect
the final spatial velocity of the companion, which is mainly affected by the
initial parameters of the progenitor systems. The spatial velocity of the
stripped material has an upper limit within the range of 8000 - 9500 km/s,
which only depends on the total kinetic energy of the explosion.The stripped
mass, the ratio of the stripped mass to the companion mass and the kick
velocity of the companion all significantly depend on the initial companion
mass and orbital period. Our model may naturally explain the spatial velocity
of the star G in the remnant of Tycho's supernova, while an energy-loss
mechanism is needed to interpret its luminosity.
"
What is the implication of the low submillimeter dust opacity index beta for the grain size in the disk surrounding MWC 297?,"  We present the results of the interferometric observations of the
circumstellar disk surrounding MWC 297 in the continuum at 230 GHz (1.3 mm) and
in the (J=2-1) rotational transitions of $^{12}$CO,$^{13}$CO and C$^{18}$O
using the Submillimeter Array. At a distance of 250 pc, MWC 297 is one of the
closest, young massive stars (M$_{\star}$ $\sim$10 M$_{\odot}$) to us. Compact
continuum emission is detected towards MWC 297 from which we estimate a disk
mass (gas+dust) of 0.07 M$_{\odot}$ and a disk radius of $\le$ 80 AU. Our
result demonstrates that circumstellar disks can survive around massive stars
well into their main sequence phase even after they have become optically
visible. Complementing our observations with the data compiled from the
literature, we find the submm dust opacity index $\beta$ to be between 0.1 and
0.3. If the emission is optically thin, the low value of $\beta$ indicates the
presence of relatively large grains in the disk, possibly because of grain
growth. We do not detect any CO emission associated with the continuum source.
We argue that the $^{13}$CO emission from the disk is likely optically thin, in
which case, we derive an upper limit to the gas mass which implies significant
depletion of molecular gas in the disk. The mass of this disk and the
evolutionary trends observed are similar to those found for intermediate mass
Herbig Ae stars and low mass T Tauri stars.
"
What are the key features of the stochastic model of the bacterial chemotaxis system?,"  Bacterial chemotaxis in Escherichia coli is a canonical system for the study
of signal transduction. A remarkable feature of this system is the coexistence
of precise adaptation in population with large fluctuating cellular behavior in
single cells (Korobkova et al. 2004, Nature, 428, 574). Using a stochastic
model, we found that the large behavioral variability experimentally observed
in non-stimulated cells is a direct consequence of the architecture of this
adaptive system. Reversible covalent modification cycles, in which methylation
and demethylation reactions antagonistically regulate the activity of
receptor-kinase complexes, operate outside the region of first-order kinetics.
As a result, the receptor-kinase that governs cellular behavior exhibits a
sigmoidal activation curve. This curve simultaneously amplifies the inherent
stochastic fluctuations in the system and lengthens the relaxation time in
response to stimulus. Because stochastic fluctuations cause large behavioral
variability and the relaxation time governs the average duration of runs in
response to small stimuli, cells with the greatest fluctuating behavior also
display the largest chemotactic response. Finally, Large-scale simulations of
digital bacteria suggest that the chemotaxis network is tuned to simultaneously
optimize the random spread of cells in absence of nutrients and the cellular
response to gradients of attractant.
"
What is the impact of using the Wisconsin H-alpha Mapper (WHAM) Northern Sky Survey as a tracer of the ionized medium on the determination of the cosmic infrared background (CIB)?,"  Determination of the cosmic infrared background (CIB) at far infrared
wavelengths using COBE/DIRBE data is limited by the accuracy to which
foreground interplanetary and Galactic dust emission can be modeled and
subtracted. Previous determinations of the far infrared CIB (e.g., Hauser et
al. 1998) were based on the detection of residual isotropic emission in skymaps
from which the emission from interplanetary dust and the neutral interstellar
medium were removed. In this paper we use the Wisconsin H-alpha Mapper (WHAM)
Northern Sky Survey as a tracer of the ionized medium to examine the effect of
this foreground component on determination of the CIB. We decompose the DIRBE
far infrared data for five high Galactic latitude regions into H I and H-alpha
correlated components and a residual component. We find the H-alpha correlated
component to be consistent with zero for each region, and we find that addition
of an H-alpha correlated component in modeling the foreground emission has
negligible effect on derived CIB results. Our CIB detections and 2 sigma upper
limits are essentially the same as those derived by Hauser et al. and are given
by nu I_nu (nW m-2 sr-1) < 75, < 32, 25 +- 8, and 13 +- 3 at 60, 100, 140, and
240 microns, respectively. Our residuals have not been subjected to a detailed
anisotropy test, so our CIB results do not supersede those of Hauser et al. We
derive upper limits on the 100 micron emissivity of the ionized medium that are
typically about 40% of the 100 micron emissivity of the neutral atomic medium.
This low value may be caused in part by a lower dust-to-gas mass ratio in the
ionized medium than in the neutral medium, and in part by a shortcoming of
using H-alpha intensity as a tracer of far infrared emission.
"
What are the equations of motion of a fermionic system closed and analytical expressions for the Green's functions obtained in terms of a finite number of parameters?,"  In this paper, we show that there is a large class of fermionic systems for
which it is possible to find, for any dimension, a finite closed set of
eigenoperators and eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian. Then, the hierarchy of the
equations of motion closes and analytical expressions for the Green's functions
are obtained in terms of a finite number of parameters, to be self-consistently
determined. Several examples are given. In particular, for these examples it is
shown that in the one-dimensional case it is possible to derive by means of
algebraic constraints a set of equations which allow us to determine the
self-consistent parameters and to obtain a complete exact solution.
"
What are the implications of the stability criterion for gravity theories?,"  A fundamental criterion of viability of any gravity theory is existence of a
stable ground-state solution being either Minkowski, dS or AdS space. Stability
of the ground state is independent of which frame is physical. In general, a
given theory has multiple ground states and splits into independent physical
sectors. All metric gravity theories with the Lagrangian being a function of
Ricci tensor are dynamically equivalent to Einstein gravity with a source and
this allows us to study the stability problem using methods developed in GR. We
apply these methods to f(R) theories. As is shown in 13 cases of Lagrangians
the stability criterion works simply and effectively whenever the curvature of
the ground state is determined. An infinite number of gravity theories have a
stable ground state and further viability criteria are necessary.
"
What are the implications of the Casimir operators for the number of invariants of semisimple algebras?,"  We analyze under which conditions the missing label problem associated to a
reduction chain $\frak{s}^{\prime}\subset \frak{s}$ of (simple) Lie algebras
can be completely solved by means of an In\""on\""u-Wigner contraction $\frak{g}$
naturally related to the embedding. This provides a new interpretation of the
missing label operators in terms of the Casimir operators of the contracted
algebra, and shows that the available labeling operators are not completely
equivalent. Further, the procedure is used to obtain upper bounds for the
number of invariants of affine Lie algebras arising as contractions of
semisimple algebras.
"
What are the elements of the partial transpose of the density matrix?,"  Quantum entanglement is an enigmatic and powerful property that has attracted
much attention due to its usefulness in new ways of communications, like
quantum teleportation and quantum key distribution. Much effort has been done
to quantify entanglement. Indeed, there exist some well-established
separability criterion and analytical formulas for the entanglement of
bipartite systems. In some of these, the crucial elements are the eigenvalues
of the partial transpose of the density matrix. In this paper, we show that one
can also have information about the entanglement of bipartite state, in C2xC2,
looking at the minimal principals of the partial transpose.
"
What is the relationship between the linear temperature dependence of the resistivity in superconductors and the linear temperature dependence of the resistivity in superconductors?,"  Both the highest- and the linear temperature dependence of the resistivity in
wide temperature range appear at the optimally doped regions of Cu-based
superconductors1,2,3,4,5, and the highest- of Fe-based superconductors6,7 are
also associated with the linear temperature dependence of the resistivity in
normal states near superconducting states. This means that the high temperature
superconductivity and the linear temperature dependence of the resistivity
should be dominated by the same mechanism. This letter on theoretic calculation
clearly shows that strong spin-charge correlation dominated resistivity behaves
the linear temperature dependence, thus high-temperature superconductivity
should be induced by strong spin-charge correlation.
"
What is the theory of acoustic wave scattering by many small bodies?,"  The theory of acoustic wave scattering by many small bodies is developed for
bodies with impedance boundary condition. It is shown that if one embeds many
small particles in a bounded domain, filled with a known material, then one can
create a new material with the properties very different from the properties of
the original material. Moreover, these very different properties occur although
the total volume of the embedded small particles is negligible compared with
the volume of the original material.
"
What is the classical theory of electron confinement in conducting nanoparticles?,"  We develop a classical theory of electron confinement in conducting
nanoparticles. The theory is used to compute the nonlinear optical response of
the nanoparticle to a harmonic external field.
"
What are the Sivers and Boer-Mulders functions used to explore the partonic spin structure of the nucleon?,"  In order to illustrate the capabilities of COMPASS using a hadronic beam, I
review some of the azimuthal asymmetries in hadronic collisions, that allow for
the extraction of transversity, Sivers and Boer-Mulders functions, necessary to
explore the partonic spin structure of the nucleon. I also report on some Monte
Carlo simulations of such asymmetries for the production of Drell-Yan lepton
pairs from the collision of high-energy pions on a transversely polarized
proton target.
"
What are the astrophysical and cosmological bounds on the weakly interacting light particles mentioned above?,"  Recently the PVLAS collaboration reported the observation of a rotation of
linearly polarized laser light induced by a transverse magnetic field -- a
signal being unexpected within standard QED. In this review, we emphasize two
mechanisms which have been proposed to explain this result: production of a
single light neutral spin-zero particle or pair production of light minicharged
particles. We discuss a class of models, involving, in addition to our familiar
``visible'' photon, further light ``hidden paraphotons'', which mix
kinematically with the visible one, and further light paracharged particles. In
these models, very strong astrophysical and cosmological bounds on the weakly
interacting light particles mentioned above can be evaded. In the upcoming
year, a number of decisive laboratory based tests of the particle
interpretation of the PVLAS anomaly will be done. More generally, such
experiments, exploiting high fluxes of low-energy photons and/or large
electromagnetic fields, will dig into previously unconstrained parameter space
of the above mentioned models.
"
What are the implications of the equation of evolution for the power spectrum of the cosmic microwave background?,"  The angular power spectra of cosmic microwave background are analyzed under
the light of the evolutional scenario of the universe based on the
renormalizable quantum theory of gravity in four dimensions. The equation of
evolution is solved numerically fixing the power law spectrum predicted by the
conformal gravity for the initial condition. The equation requires to introduce
a dynamical energy scale about 10^{17}GeV, where the inflationary space-time
evolution makes a transition to the big-bang of the conventional Friedmann
universe. The quality of fit to the three-year data of WMAP implies the
possibility to understand the observation by quantum gravity.
"
What is the relationship between the pion-nucleon sigma and pion-Delta sigma terms in quantum chromodynamics?,"  We evaluate the pion-nucleon and the pion-Delta sigma terms by employing the
method of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) sum rules. The obtained value of the
pion-nucleon sigma term is compatible with the larger values already
anticipated by the recent calculations. It is also found that the pion-Delta
sigma term is as large as the pion-nucleon sigma term.
"
What is the connection between matrix product factorizations and matrix multiplication?,"  A diagram is introduced for visualizing matrix product states which makes
transparent a connection between matrix product factorizations of states and
operators, and complex weighted finite state automata. It is then shown how one
can proceed in the opposite direction: writing an automaton that ``generates''
an operator gives one an immediate matrix product factorization of it. Matrix
product factorizations have the advantage of reducing the cost of computing
expectation values by facilitating caching of intermediate calculations. Thus
our connection to complex weighted finite state automata yields insight into
what allows for efficient caching in matrix product algorithms. Finally, these
techniques are generalized to the case of multiple dimensions.
"
What are the spectral changes observed in the bulk spectra of CaRuO$_3$?,"  We investigate the role of long range ferromagnetic order in the electronic
structure of Sr$_{1-x}$Ca$_x$RuO$_3$ using high resolution photoemission
spectroscopy. SrRuO$_3$ is a ferromagnetic metal but isostructural,
isoelectronic CaRuO$_3$ is an enhanced paramagnet. Surface spectra of CaRuO$_3$
exhibit temperature induced modifications. This is not significant in other
compositions. This may be attributed to the structural changes observed in
previous studies. Interestingly, the bulk spectra reveal unusual spectral
changes exhibiting large decrease in the coherent feature intensity
corresponding to only ferromagnetic samples, although the Ru moment is very
similar in all the compositions.
"
What is the SDSS J102146.44+234926.3 classified as a WZ Sge type dwarf nova?,"  We report CCD photometry and spectroscopy during 2006 outburst of the dwarf
nova SDSS J102146.44+234926.3 (SDSS J1021). The photographic plates from the
MAO, SAI and CrAO plate archives, which cover the position of the SDSS J1021,
were inspected for the presence of previous outbursts. We also present the
BVRcIc photometric calibration of 52 stars in SDSS J1021 vicinity, which have
V-magnitude in the range of 11.21-17.23m and can serve as comparison stars. The
large amplitude of the SDSS J1021 outburst of 7m, superhumps with a period
below the ''period gap'', rebrightening during the declining stage of
superoutburst, rarity of outbursts and obtained spectrum allow to classify this
object as a WZ Sge type dwarf nova.
"
What are the possible sources of r-process nuclei in the neutrino-driven winds of nascent neutron stars?,"  We present a review of the possible sources for r-process nuclei. It is known
that there is as yet no self-consistent mechanism to provide abundant neutrons
for a robust r-process in the neutrino-driven winds from nascent neutron stars.
We consider that the heavy r-nuclei with mass numbers A>130 (Ba and above)
cannot be produced in the neutrino-driven winds. Nonetheless, the r-process and
the neutrino-driven winds may be directly or indirectly related by some unknown
additional mechanism, which, for example, could provide ejecta with very short
dynamic timescales of <0.004 s. This undetermined mechanism must supply a
neutron source within the same general stellar sites that undergo core collapse
to produce the neutron star. Observational data on low-metallicity stars in the
Galactic halo show that sites producing the heavy r-nuclei do not produce Fe or
any other elements between N and Ge. Insofar as a forming neutron star is key
to producing the heavy r-nuclei, then the only possible sources are supernovae
resulting from collapse of O-Ne-Mg cores or accretion-induced collapse of white
dwarfs, neither of which produce the elements of the Fe group or those of
intermediate mass (above C and N). Using a template star with high enrichments
of heavy r-nuclei and another with low enrichments we develop a two-component
model based on the abundances of Eu (from sources for heavy r-nuclei) and Fe
(from Fe core-collapse supernovae). This model gives very good quantitative
predictions for the abundances of all the other elements in those metal-poor
stars with [Fe/H]<-1.5 for which the Eu and Fe abundances are known. (Abridged)
"
What are the implications of correcting for the different progenitor routes in future supernovae surveys?,"  We use the VESPA algorithm and spectra from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey to
investigate the star formation history of the host galaxies of 257 Type Ia
supernovae. We find 5$\sigma$ evidence for a short-lived population of
progenitors with lifetimes of less than 180 Myr, indicating a Type Ia supernova
channel arising from stars in the mass range $\sim$3.5-8 $M_\odot$. As
standardizeable candles, Type Ia supernovae play an important role in
determining the expansion history of the Universe, but to be useful for future
cosmological surveys, the peak luminosity needs to be free of uncorrected
systematic effects at the level of 1-2%. If the different progenitor routes
lead to supernovae with even moderately small differences in properties, then
these need to be corrected for separately, or they could lead to a systematic
bias in future supernovae surveys, as the prompt route is likely to increase in
importance at high redshift. VESPA analysis of hosts could be a valuable tool
in this, by identifying which progenitor route is most likely.
"
What is the theory of QED x QCD resummation and its interplay with shower/matrix element matching in precision LHC physics scenarios?,"  We present the theory of QED x QCD resummation and its interplay with
shower/matrix element matching in precision LHC physics scenarios. We
illustrate the theory using single heavy gauge boson production at hadron
colliders.
"
What are the implications of the entanglement generation for the accelerated atoms in vacuum?,"  We study, in the framework of open systems, the entanglement generation of
two independent uniformly accelerated atoms in interaction with the vacuum
fluctuations of massless scalar fields subjected to a reflecting plane
boundary. We demonstrate that, with the presence of the boundary, the
accelerated atoms exhibit distinct features from static ones in a thermal bath
at the corresponding Unruh temperature in terms of the entanglement creation at
the neighborhood of the initial time. In this sense, accelerated atoms in
vacuum do not necessarily have to behave as if they were static in a thermal
bath at the Unruh temperature.
"
What are the statefinder parameters of the Lambda-CDM model?,"  In this paper we have considered the Universe to be filled with Modified Gas
and the Cosmological Constant $\Lambda$ to be time-dependent with or without
the Gravitational Constant $G$ to be time-dependent. We have considered various
phenomenological models for $\Lambda$, viz., $\Lambda\propto\rho,
\Lambda\propto\frac{\dot{a}^{2}}{a^{2}}$ and
$\Lambda\propto\frac{\ddot{a}}{a}$. Using these models it is possible to show
the accelerated expansion of the Universe at the present epoch. Also we have
shown the natures of $G$ and $\Lambda$ over the total age of the Universe.
Using the statefinder parameters we have shown the diagramamtical
representation of the evolution of the Universe starting from radiation era to
$\Lambda$CDM model.
"
What is the physical interpretation of the loss of coherence of superpositions of momentum eigenstates?,"  Recently the general form of a translation-covariant quantum Boltzmann
equation has been derived which describes the dynamics of a tracer particle in
a quantum gas. We develop a stochastic wave function algorithm that enables
full three-dimensional Monte Carlo simulations of this equation. The simulation
method is used to study the approach to equilibrium for various scattering
cross sections and to determine dynamical deviations from Gaussian statistics
through an investigation of higher-order cumulants. Moreover, we examine the
loss of coherence of superpositions of momentum eigenstates and determine the
corresponding decoherence time scales to quantify the transition from quantum
to classical behavior of the state of the test particle.
"
What are the consequences of the Coulomb repulsion between charge carriers in FETs?,"  Recent experiments have demonstrated that the performances of organic FETs
strongly depend on the dielectric properties of the gate insulator. In
particular, it has been shown that the temperature dependence of the mobility
evolves from a metallic-like to an insulating behavior upon increasing the
dielectric constant of the gate material. This phenomenon can be explained in
terms of the formation of small polarons, due to the polar interaction of the
charge carriers with the phonons at the organic/dielectric interface. Building
on this model, the possible consequences of the Coulomb repulsion between the
carriers at high concentrations are analyzed.
"
What are the extremal limits of the measures of maximum entropy?,"  We study Abelian sandpiles on graphs of the form $G \times I$, where $G$ is
an arbitrary finite connected graph, and $I \subset \Z$ is a finite interval.
We show that for any fixed $G$ with at least two vertices, the stationary
measures $\mu_I = \mu_{G \times I}$ have two extremal weak limit points as $I
\uparrow \Z$. The extremal limits are the only ergodic measures of maximum
entropy on the set of infinite recurrent configurations. We show that under any
of the limiting measures, one can add finitely many grains in such a way that
almost surely all sites topple infinitely often. We also show that the extremal
limiting measures admit a Markovian coding.
"
What are the atmospheric monitoring instruments used at the Pierre Auger Observatory?,"  A wide range of atmospheric monitoring instruments is employed at the Pierre
Auger Observatory: two laser facilities, elastic lidar stations, aerosol phase
function monitors, a horizontal attenuation monitor, star monitors, weather
stations, and balloon soundings. We describe the impact of analyzed atmospheric
data on the accuracy of shower reconstructions, and in particular study the
effect of the data on the shower energy and the depth of shower maximum (Xmax).
These effects have been studied using the subset of golden hybrid events -
events observed with high quality in the fluorescence and surface detector -
used in the calibration of the surface detector energy spectrum.
"
What is the mass loss rate of carbon rich AGB stars as a function of stellar parameters?,"  It is well established that mass loss from AGB stars due to dust driven winds
cannot be arbitrarily low. We model the mass loss from carbon rich AGB stars
using detailed frequency-dependent radiation hydrodynamics including dust
formation. We present a study of the thresholds for the mass loss rate as a
function of stellar parameters based on a subset of a larger grid of such
models and compare these results to previous observational and theoretical
work. Furthermore, we demonstrate the impact of the pulsation mechanism and
dust formation for the creation of a stellar wind and how it affects these
thresholds and briefly discuss the consequences for stellar evolution.
"
What is the parameter $\delta$ in the Hamiltonian constraint?,"  In the context of loop quantum cosmology, we parametrise the lattice
refinement by a parameter, $A$, and the matter Hamiltonian by a parameter,
$\delta$. We then solve the Hamiltonian constraint for both a self-adjoint, and
a non-self-adjoint Hamiltonian operator. Demanding that the solutions for the
wave-functions obey certain physical restrictions, we impose constraints on the
two-dimensional, $(A,\delta)$, parameter space, thereby restricting the types
of matter content that can be supported by a particular lattice refinement
model.
"
What is the relationship between econophysics and the amplification principle from applied physics?,"  Most of the econometric and econophysics models have been borrowed from the
statistical physics, and as a cosequence, a new interdisciplinary science
called econophysics has emerged. In this paper we planned to extend the analogy
between different economic processes or phenomena and processes and phenomena
from different fields of physics, other than statistical physics. On the basis
of the economic development process and amplification phenomenon analogy, a new
econophysics model, named economic amplifier, on the electronic amplification
principle from applied physics was proposed und largely analyzed.
"
What is the fraction of planets detectable through the new channels of detecting planetary signals?,"  We classify various types of planetary lensing signals and the channels of
detecting them. We estimate the relative frequencies of planet detections
through the individual channels with special emphasis on the new channels to be
additionally provided by future lensing experiments that will survey wide
fields continuously at high cadence by using very large-format imaging cameras.
  From this investigation, we find that the fraction of wide-separation planets
that would be discovered through the new channels of detecting planetary
signals as independent and repeating events would be substantial. We estimate
that the fraction of planets detectable through the new channels would comprise
~15 -- 30% of all planets depending on the models of the planetary separation
distribution and mass ratios of planets. Considering that a significant
fraction of planets might exist in the form of free-floating planets, the
frequency of planets to be detected through the new channel would be even
higher. With the expansion of the channels of detecting planet, future lensing
surveys will greatly expand the range of planets to be probed.
"
What is the global polarization of Lambda and anti-Lambda hyperons observed in Au+Au collisions?,"  The system created in non-central relativistic nucleus-nucleus collisions
possesses large orbital angular momentum. Due to spin-orbit coupling, particles
produced in such a system could become globally polarized along the direction
of the system angular momentum. We present the results of Lambda and
anti-Lambda hyperon global polarization measurements in Au+Au collisions at
sqrt{s_NN}=62.4 GeV and 200 GeV performed with the STAR detector at RHIC. The
observed global polarization of Lambda and anti-Lambda hyperons in the STAR
acceptance is consistent with zero within the precision of the measurements.
The obtained upper limit, |P_{Lambda,anti-Lambda}| <= 0.02, is compared to the
theoretical values discussed recently in the literature.

saturation magnetization.,"  In this paper we present some recent work performed at ""Carlo Novero"" lab on
Quantum Information and Foundations of Quantum Mechanics.
"
What is the nature of the discontinuity for C_V when passing from a superconducting phase to the other one?,"  The recently proposed theoretical model of superconductors endowed with two
distinct superconducting phases and critical temperatures is further analyzed
by introducing two distinct order parameters, described by two scalar fields
which condensate at different temperatures. We find some deviations in basic
thermodynamical quantities with respect to the Ginzburg-Landau one-phase
superconductors. In particular, by contrast to the usual case where only one
jump in specific heat takes place at the normal-superconductor transition
temperature, we actually predict an additional discontinuity for C_V when
passing from a superconducting phase to the other one.
"
"What are the completeness levels for detecting planets in the survey, and what can be inferred about theoretical planet distributions?","  We present the results of a survey of 45 young (<250 Myr), close (<50 pc)
stars with the Simultaneous Differential Imager (SDI) implemented at the VLT
and the MMT for the direct detection of extrasolar planets. As part of the
survey, we observed 54 objects total, of which 45 were close, young stars, 2
were somewhat more distant (<150 pc), very young (<10 Myr) stars, 3 were stars
with known radial velocity planets, and 4 were older, very nearby (<20 pc)
solar analogues. Our SDI devices use a double Wollaston prism and a quad filter
to take images simultaneously at 3 wavelengths surrounding the 1.62 um methane
absorption bandhead found in the spectrum of cool brown dwarfs and gas giant
planets. In our VLT data, we achieved H band contrasts > 10 mag (5 sigma) at a
separation of 0.5"" from the primary star on 45% of our targets and H band
contrasts of > 9 mag at a separation of 0.5'' on 80% of our targets. With this
degree of attenuation, we should be able to image (5sigma detection) a 5
M_{Jup} planet 15 AU from a 70 Myr K1 star at 15 pc or a 5 M_{Jup} planet at 2
AU from a 12 Myr M star at 10 pc. We believe that our SDI images are the
highest contrast astronomical images ever made from ground or space for methane
rich companions <1'' from their star. For the best 20 of our survey stars, we
attained 50% 5 sigma completeness for 6-10 M_Jup planets at semi-major axes of
20-40 AU. Thus, our completeness levels are sufficient to significantly test
theoretical planet distributions. From our survey null result, we can rule out
(at the 98% confidence/2.0sigma level) a model planet population using a planet
distribution where N(a) $\propto$ constant out to a distance of 45 AU (further
model assumptions discussed within).
"
What is the typical duration of the overlapping period of two consecutive solar cycles?,"  Solar magnetic synoptic charts obtained by NSO/Kitt Peak and SOHO/MDI are
analyzed for studying the appearance of bipolar magnetic regions (BMRs) during
solar minima. As a result, we find the emergence of long-lived BMRs has three
typical features. (1) BMRs' emerging rates of the new cycles increase about 3
times faster than those of the old cycles decrease. (2) Two consecutive solar
cycles have an overlapping period of near 10 Carrington rotations. During this
very short overlapping time interval, BMRs of two cycles tend to concentrate in
the same longitudes. (3) About 53% BMRs distribute with a longitudinal distance
of 1/8 solar rotation. Such phenomenon suggests a longitudinal mode of m=8
existing during solar minima.
"
What are the elementary functions that represent flat rings structures?,"  Pairs potential-density in terms of elementary functions that represents flat
rings structures are presented. We study structures representing one or several
concentric flat rings. Also disks surrounded by concentric flat rings are
exhibited. The stability of concentrically circular orbits of particles moving
on a flat ring structure is analyzed for radial perturbations.
"
What is the main challenge in using Friedmann-Lemaître cosmology to model the observable patch of the Universe?,"  Observational cosmology provides us with a large number of high precision
data which are used to derive models trying to reproduce ``on the mean'' our
observable patch of the Universe. Most of these attempts are achieved in the
framework of a Friedmann-Lema\^itre cosmology where large scale homogeneity is
assumed. However, we know, from the observation of structures at increasing
scales, that these models are only approximations of a smoothed or averaged
inhomogeneous underlying patern. Anyhow, when modelling the Universe, the usual
method is to use continuous functions representing the kinematical scalars of
the velocity field, implicitly assuming that they represent volume averages of
the corresponding fine-scale inhomogeneous quantities, then put them into the
Einstein equations which are solved to give the model and its dependance upon a
number of parameters arbitrarily defined. In General Relativity, such a method
is very much involved since the equations which determine the metric tensor and
the quantities calculated from it are highly nonlinear. The question raised by
the method consisting of determining the parameters of an a priori assumed FLRW
model from observational data is the ``fitting problem'' brought to general
attention by Ellis and Stoeger in the 80's. This problem has recently
experienced a reniewed attention due to the amount of available data and the
increase of the minimum scale at which homogeneity can be assumed. We propose a
discussion of this issue in the light of the latest developments of
observational and theoretical cosmology.
"
What are the properties of the generator of the canonical dual in the Wiener amalgam space?,"  We use a generalization of Wiener's $1/f$ theorem to prove that for a Gabor
frame with the generator in the Wiener amalgam space $W(L^{\infty},
\ell^{1}_{\nu})(\mathbb{R}^{d})$, the corresponding frame operator is
invertible on this space. Therefore, for such a Gabor frame, the generator of
the canonical dual belongs also to $W(L^{\infty},
\ell^{1}_{\nu})(\mathbb{R}^{d}) $
"
What are the advantages of using a few-cycle laser pulse in combination with a controlling field?,"  A new method to coherently control the electron dynamics is proposed using a
few-cycle laser pulse in combination with a controlling field. It is shown that
this method not only broadens the attosecond pulse bandwidth, but also reduces
the chirp, then an isolated 80-as pulse is straightforwardly obtained and even
shorter pulse is achievable by increasing the intensity of the controlling
field. Such ultrashort pulses allow one to investigate ultrafast electronic
processes which have never be achieved before. In addition, the few-cycle
synthesized pulse is expected to manipulate a wide range of laser-atom
interactions.
"
"What is the equation of state of the universe, which is a key to understanding the ultimate fate of the universe?","  Our universe is observed to be accelerating due to the dominant dark energy
with negative pressure. The dark energy equation of state (w) holds a key to
understanding the ultimate fate of the universe. The cosmic voids behave like
bubbles in the universe so that their shapes must be quite sensitive to the
background cosmology. Assuming a flat universe and using the priors on the
matter density parameter (Omega_m) and the dimensionless Hubble parameter (h),
we demonstrate analytically that the ellipticity evolution of cosmic voids may
be a sensitive probe of the dark energy equation of state. We also discuss the
parameter degeneracy between w and Omega_m.
"
What is the optimal decoder that minimizes the average of the transmission error probability over all channel estimation errors?,"  The optimal decoder achieving the outage capacity under imperfect channel
estimation is investigated. First, by searching into the family of nearest
neighbor decoders, which can be easily implemented on most practical coded
modulation systems, we derive a decoding metric that minimizes the average of
the transmission error probability over all channel estimation errors. This
metric, for arbitrary memoryless channels, achieves the capacity of a composite
(more noisy) channel. Next, according to the notion of estimation-induced
outage capacity (EIO capacity) introduced in our previous work, we characterize
maximal achievable information rates associated to the proposed decoder. The
performance of the proposed decoding metric over uncorrelated Rayleigh fading
MIMO channels is compared to both the classical mismatched maximum-likelihood
(ML) decoder and the theoretical limits given by the EIO capacity (i.e. the
best decoder in presence of channel estimation errors). Numerical results show
that the derived metric provides significant gains, in terms of achievable
information rates and bit error rate (BER), in a bit interleaved coded
modulation (BICM) framework, without introducing any additional decoding
complexity.
"
What is the relationship between the generators of the diffeomorphism group and the algebra of infinitely differentiable functions on the manifold?,"  A unique classification of the topological effects associated to quantum
mechanics on manifolds is obtained on the basis of the invariance under
diffeomorphisms and the realization of the Lie-Rinehart relations between the
generators of the diffeomorphism group and the algebra of infinitely
differentiable functions on the manifold. This leads to a unique
(""Lie-Rinehart"") C* algebra as observable algebra; its regular representations
are shown to be locally Schroedinger and in one to one correspondence with the
unitary representations of the fundamental group of the manifold. Therefore, in
the absence of spin degrees of freedom and external fields, the first homotopy
group of the manifold appears as the only source of topological effects.
"
What is the key result of the proof?,"  In this paper, we prove that the general tiling problem of the hyperbolic
plane is undecidable by proving a slightly stronger version using only a
regular polygon as the basic shape of the tiles. The problem was raised by a
paper of Raphael Robinson in 1971, in his famous simplified proof that the
general tiling problem is undecidable for the Euclidean plane, initially proved
by Robert Berger in 1966.
"
How does the nonlinearity of the problem manifest itself in the result that a non-zero circulation is possible with zero total phase around the loop?,"  We investigate the problem of vortex trapping in cyclically coupled
Bose-Josephson junctions. Starting with $N$ independent BECs we couple the
condensates through Josephson links and allow the system to reach a stable
circulation by adding a dissipative term in our semiclassical equations of
motion. The central question we address is what is the probability to trap a
vortex with winding number $m$. Our numerical simulations reveal that the final
distribution of winding numbers is narrower than the initial distribution of
total phases, indicating an increased probability for no-vortex configurations.
Further, the nonlinearity of the problem manifests itself in the somewhat
counter-intuitive result that it is possible to obtain a non-zero circulation
starting with zero total phase around the loop. The final width of the
distribution of winding numbers for $N$ sites scales as $\lambda N^{\alpha}$,
where $\alpha=0.47\pm 0.01$ and $\lambda <0.67$ (value predicted for the
initial distribution) indicating a shrinking of the final distribution. The
actual value of $\lambda$ is found to depend on the strength of dissipation.
"
What is the rectification degree in a bipolar nanofluidic diode?,"  We have investigated ion current rectification properties of a recently
prepared bipolar nanofluidic diode. This device is based on a single conically
shaped nanopore in a polymer film whose pore walls contain a sharp boundary
between positively and negatively charged regions. A semi-quantitative model
that employs Poisson and Nernst-Plank equations predicts current-voltage curves
as well as ionic concentrations and electric potential distributions in this
system. We show that under certain conditions the rectification degree, defined
as a ratio of currents recorded at the same voltage but opposite polarities,
can reach values of over a 1000 at a voltage range <-2 V, +2 V>. The role of
thickness and position of the transition zone on the ion current rectification
is discussed as well. We also show that rectification degree scales with the
applied voltage.
"
What is the relationship between the magnetic field in supernova remnants and cosmic ray acceleration?,"  Nonlinear kinetic theory of cosmic ray (CR) acceleration in supernova
remnants is employed to calculate CR spectra. The magnetic field in SNRs is
assumed to be significantly amplified by the efficiently accelerating nuclear
CR component. It is shown that the calculated CR spectra agree in a
satisfactory way with the existing measurements up to the energy $10^{17}$ eV.
The power law spectrum of protons extends up to the energy $3\times 10^{15}$ eV
with a subsequent exponential cutoff. It gives a natural explanation for the
observed knee in the Galactic CR spectrum. The maximum energy of the
accelerated nuclei is proportional to their charge number $Z$. Therefore the
break in the Galactic CR spectrum is the result of the contribution of
progressively heavier species in the overall CR spectrum so that at $10^{17}$
eV the CR spectrum is dominated by iron group nuclei. It is shown that this
component plus a suitably chosen extragalactic CR component can give a
consistent description for the entire Galactic CR spectrum.
"
What are the implications of the observed redshift distributions of the SNe in the Subaru Deep Field and the Hubble Space Telescope/GOODS sample?,"  Large samples of high-redshift supernovae (SNe) are potentially powerful
probes of cosmic star formation, metal enrichment, and SN physics. We present
initial results from a new deep SN survey, based on re-imaging in the R, i', z'
bands, of the 0.25 deg2 Subaru Deep Field (SDF), with the 8.2-m Subaru
telescope and Suprime-Cam. In a single new epoch consisting of two nights of
observations, we have discovered 33 candidate SNe, down to a z'-band magnitude
of 26.3 (AB). We have measured the photometric redshifts of the SN host
galaxies, obtained Keck spectroscopic redshifts for 17 of the host galaxies,
and classified the SNe using the Bayesian photometric algorithm of Poznanski et
al. (2007) that relies on template matching. After correcting for biases in the
classification, 55% of our sample consists of Type Ia supernovae and 45% of
core-collapse SNe. The redshift distribution of the SNe Ia reaches z ~ 1.6,
with a median of z ~ 1.2. The core-collapse SNe reach z ~ 1.0, with a median of
z ~ 0.5. Our SN sample is comparable to the Hubble Space Telescope/GOODS sample
both in size and redshift range. The redshift distributions of the SNe in the
SDF and in GOODS are consistent, but there is a trend (which requires
confirmation using a larger sample) for more high-z SNe Ia in the SDF. This
trend is also apparent when comparing the SN Ia rates we derive to those based
on GOODS data. Our results suggest a fairly constant rate at high redshift that
could be tracking the star-formation rate. Additional epochs on this field,
already being obtained, will enlarge our SN sample to the hundreds, and
determine whether or not there is a decline in the SN Ia rate at z >~ 1.
"
What is the MSA theory used to describe ion mixtures?,"  Ion mixtures require an exclusion core to avoid collapse. The Debye Hueckel
theory, where ions are point charges, is accurate only in the limit of infinite
dilution. The MSA is the embedding of hard cores into DH, is valid for higher
densities. In the MSA the properties of any ionic mixture can be represented by
a single screening parameter $\Gamma$. For equal ionic size restricted model is
obtained from the Debye parameter $\kappa$. This one parameter representation
(BIMSA) is valid for complex and associating systems, such as the general
n-polyelectrolytes. The BIMSA is the only theory that satisfies the infinite
dilution limit of the DH theory for any chain length. The contact pair
distribution function of hard ions mixture is a functional of $\Gamma$ and a
small mean field parameter. This yields good agreement with the Monte Carlo
(Bresme et al. Phys. Rev. E {\textbf 51} 289 (1995)) .
"
How does the magnetostriction of a quantum magnet depend on the magnetic exchange coupling?,"  We report a method for determining the spatial dependence of the magnetic
exchange coupling, $dJ/dr$, from magnetostriction measurements of a quantum
magnet. The organic Ni $S = 1$ system NiCl$_2$-4SC(NH$_2$)$_2$ exhibits lattice
distortions in response to field-induced canted antiferromagnetism between
$H_{c1} = 2.1$ T and $H_{c2} = 12.6$ T. We are able to model the
magnetostriction in terms of uniaxial stress on the sample created by magnetic
interactions between neighboring Ni atoms along the c-axis. The uniaxial strain
is equal to $(1/E)dJ_c/dx_c < S_{\bf r} \cdot S_{{\bf r}+ {\bf e}_c} >$, where
$E$, $J_c$, $x_c$ and ${\bf e}_c$ are the Young's modulus, the nearest neighbor
(NN) exchange coupling, the variable lattice parameter, and the relative vector
between NN sites along the c-axis. We present magnetostriction data taken at 25
mK together with Quantum Monte Carlo calculations of the NN spin-spin
correlation function that are in excellent agreement with each other. We have
also measured Young's modulus using resonant ultrasound, and we can thus
extract $dJ_c/dx_c = 2.5$ K/$\AA$, yielding a total change in $J_c$ between
$H_{c1}$ and $H_{c2}$ of 5.5 mK or 0.25% in response to an 0.022% change in
length of the sample.
"
What are the conditions for the transition from normal to super-radiance phase in the fermion Dicke model?,"  The Dicke model describes an ensemble of N identical two-level atoms (qubits)
coupled to a single mode of a bosonic field. The fermion Dicke model should be
obtained by changing the atomic pseudo-spin operators by a linear combination
of Fermi operators. The generalized fermion Dicke model is defined introducing
different coupling constants between the single mode of the bosonic field and
the reservoir. In the thermodynamic limit, the fermion Dicke model can be
analized using the path integral approach with functional method. The system
exhibits a second order phase transition from normal to superrandiance at some
critical temperature with the presence of a condensate. We evaluate the
critical transition temperature and present the spectrum of the collective
bosonic excitations. There is quantum phantum critical behavior when the
coupling constants satisfy an especific condition. Two particular situations
are analyzed. First, we present the spectrum of the collective bosonic
excitations in the case using the rotating-wave approximation, recovering the
well know results. Second, the case only considering virtual processes. In the
last case, it is possible to have a superradiance phase when only virtual
processes are introduced in the interaction Hamiltonian. Here also appears a
quantum phase transition at some critical coupling, and for larger values for
the critical coupling, the system enter in this superradiant phase with a
Goldstone mode.
"
What is the nature of gap-acoustic solitons (GASs) in optical fiber?,"  Optical gap solitons, which exist due to a balance of nonlinearity and
dispersion due to a Bragg grating, can couple to acoustic waves through
electrostriction. This gives rise to a new species of ``gap-acoustic'' solitons
(GASs), for which we find exact analytic solutions. The GAS consists of an
optical pulse similar to the optical gap soliton, dressed by an accompanying
phonon pulse. Close to the speed of sound, the phonon component is large. In
subsonic (supersonic) solitons, the phonon pulse is a positive (negative)
density variation. Coupling to the acoustic field damps the solitons'
oscillatory instability, and gives rise to a distinct instability for
supersonic solitons, which may make the GAS decelerate and change direction,
ultimately making the soliton subsonic.
"
What is the Mass Varying Neutrinos (MaVaNs) model in supersymmetric theory?,"  We consider a Mass Varying Neutrinos (MaVaNs) model in supersymmetric theory.
The model includes effects of supersymmetry breaking transmitted by the
gravitational interaction from the hidden sector, in which supersymmetry was
broken, to the dark energy sector. Then evolutions of the neutrino mass and the
equation of state parameter of the dark energy are presented in the model. It
is remarked that only the mass of a sterile neutrino is variable in the case of
the vanishing mixing between the left-handed and a sterile neutrino on
cosmological time scale. The finite mixing makes the mass of the left-handed
neutrino variable.
"
What are the gluonic phases in the cold neutral two flavor dense quark matter?,"  A numerical analysis of several phases in the cold neutral two flavor dense
quark matter is realized. In the analysis, besides the normal, single plane
wave LOFF, and color superconducting 2SC/g2SC phases, we also include two
gluonic phases (the gluonic cylindrical phase II and the gluonic color-spin
locked one). It is shown that these two gluonic phases are dynamically realized
and, on the basis of this analysis, the phase diagram with respect to the
coupling strength in this medium is suggested. In particular, it is shown that
the gluonic phases are energetically favorable in a wide region of the
parameter space. On the other hand, there also exists a window where the LOFF
phase is stable. The 2SC state and the normal one are realized in the strong
and weak coupling regimes, respectively, as was expected.
"
What are the implications of the observed spectral indices for the nature of the winds in the massive young stellar objects?,"  We present high-resolution observations made with the Very Large Array (VLA)
in its A configuration at frequencies between 5 and 43 GHz of a sample of five
massive young stellar objects (YSOs): LkHa101, NGC2024-IRS2, S106-IR, W75N and
S140-IRS1. The resolution varied from 0.04 arcsec (at 43 GHz) to 0.5 arcsec (at
5 GHz), corresponding to a linear resolution as high as 17 AU for our nearest
source. A MERLIN observation of S106-IR at 23 GHz with 0.03-arcsec resolution
is also presented. S106-IR and S140-IRS1 are elongated at 43 GHz perpendicular
to their large scale bipolar outflows. This confirms the equatorial wind
picture for these sources seen previously in MERLIN 5 GHz observations. The
other sources are marginally resolved at 43 GHz. The spectral indices we derive
for the sources in our sample range from +0.2 to +0.8, generally consistent
with ionized stellar winds. We have modelled our sources as uniform, isothermal
spherical winds, with LkHa101 and NGC2024-IRS2 yielding the best fits. However,
in all cases our fits give wind temperatures of only 2000 to 5000 K, much less
than the effective temperatures of main-sequence stars of the same luminosity,
a result which is likely due to the clumpy nature of the winds.
"
What is the generalized definition of the temperature in a nonequilibrium system?,"  The laws of thermodynamics provide a clear concept of the temperature for an
equilibrium system in the continuum limit. Meanwhile, the equipartition theorem
allows one to make a connection between the ensemble average of the kinetic
energy and the uniform temperature. When a system or its environment is far
from equilibrium, however, such an association does not necessarily apply. In
small systems, the regression hypothesis may not even apply. Herein, we show
that in small nonequilibrium systems, the regression hypothesis still holds
though with a generalized definition of the temperature. The latter must now be
defined for each such manifestation.
"
What is the two-parameter Poisson-Dirichlet model for exchangeable random partitions?,"  We study fragmentation trees of Gibbs type. In the binary case, we identify
the most general Gibbs-type fragmentation tree with Aldous' beta-splitting
model, which has an extended parameter range $\beta>-2$ with respect to the
${\rm beta}(\beta+1,\beta+1)$ probability distributions on which it is based.
In the multifurcating case, we show that Gibbs fragmentation trees are
associated with the two-parameter Poisson--Dirichlet models for exchangeable
random partitions of $\mathbb {N}$, with an extended parameter range
$0\le\alpha\le1$, $\theta\ge-2\alpha$ and $\alpha<0$, $\theta =-m\alpha$, $m\in
\mathbb {N}$.
"
What is the relationship between magnetic fields and the dielectric properties of manganites?,"  Charge-ordered rare earth manganites Nd0.5Ca0.5MnO3, La0.25Nd0.25Ca0.5MnO3,
Pr0.7Ca0.3MnO3 and Pr0.6Ca0.4MnO3 are found to exhibit dielectric constant
anomalies around the charge-ordering or the magnetic transition temperatures.
Magnetic fields have a marked effect on the dielectric properties, indicating
the presence of coupling between the magnetic and electrical order parameters.
The observation of magnetoferroelectricity in these manganites is in accord
with the recent theoretical predictions of Khomskii and coworkers.
"
What are the implications of geo-neutrinos for the origins of the Earth?,"  The deepest hole that has ever been dug is about 12 km deep. Geochemists
analyze samples from the Earth's crust and from the top of the mantle.
Seismology can reconstruct the density profile throughout all Earth, but not
its composition. In this respect, our planet is mainly unexplored.
Geo-neutrinos, the antineutrinos from the progenies of U, Th and K40 decays in
the Earth, bring to the surface information from the whole planet, concerning
its content of natural radioactive elements. Their detection can shed light on
the sources of the terrestrial heat flow, on the present composition, and on
the origins of the Earth. Geo-neutrinos represent a new probe of our planet,
which can be exploited as a consequence of two fundamental advances that
occurred in the last few years: the development of extremely low background
neutrino detectors and the progress on understanding neutrino propagation. We
review the status and the prospects of the field.
"
"What is the conditional distribution of the number of edges in H_d(n,p) given connectivity?","  Let $H_d(n,p)$ signify a random $d$-uniform hypergraph with $n$ vertices in
which each of the ${n}\choose{d}$ possible edges is present with probability
$p=p(n)$ independently, and let $H_d(n,m)$ denote a uniformly distributed with
$n$ vertices and $m$ edges. We derive local limit theorems for the joint
distribution of the number of vertices and the number of edges in the largest
component of $H_d(n,p)$ and $H_d(n,m)$ for the regime ${{n-1}\choose{d-1}}
p,dm/n >(d-1)^{-1}+\epsilon$. As an application, we obtain an asymptotic
formula for the probability that $H_d(n,p)$ or $H_d(n,m)$ is connected. In
addition, we infer a local limit theorem for the conditional distribution of
the number of edges in $H_d(n,p)$ given connectivity. While most prior work on
this subject relies on techniques from enumerative combinatorics, we present a
new, purely probabilistic approach.
"
What are the implications of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle for quantum fluctuations?,"  This note is sketching a simple and natural mathematical construction for
explaining the probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics. It employs
nonstandard analysis and is based on Feynman's interpretation of the Heisenberg
uncertainty principle, i.e., of the quantum fluctuations, which was brought to
the forefront in some fractal approaches. It results, as in Nelson's stochastic
mechanics, in stochastic differential equations which are deduced from
infinitesimal random walks. An extended english abstract gives most of the
details.
"
What are the rheological properties in terms of the coefficient of restitution and the reduced shear rate for Maxwell models?,"  The Boltzmann equation for inelastic Maxwell models is considered to
determine the velocity moments through fourth degree in the simple shear flow
state. First, the rheological properties (which are related to the
second-degree velocity moments) are {\em exactly} evaluated in terms of the
coefficient of restitution $\alpha$ and the (reduced) shear rate $a^*$. For a
given value of $\alpha$, the above transport properties decrease with
increasing shear rate. Moreover, as expected, the third-degree and the
asymmetric fourth-degree moments vanish in the long time limit when they are
scaled with the thermal speed. On the other hand, as in the case of elastic
collisions, our results show that, for a given value of $\alpha$, the scaled
symmetric fourth-degree moments diverge in time for shear rates larger than a
certain critical value $a_c^*(\alpha)$ which decreases with increasing
dissipation. The explicit shear-rate dependence of the fourth-degree moments
below this critical value is also obtained.
"
What is the radius of the planet Neptune GJ 436b derived from the Spitzer Space Telescope data?,"  We present Spitzer Space Telescope infrared photometry of a primary transit
of the hot Neptune GJ 436b. The observations were obtained using the 8 microns
band of the InfraRed Array Camera (IRAC). The high accuracy of the transit data
and the weak limb-darkening in the 8 microns IRAC band allow us to derive
(assuming M = 0.44 +- 0.04 Msun for the primary) a precise value for the
planetary radius (4.19 +0.21-0.16 Rearth), the stellar radius (0.463
+0.022-0.017 Rsun), the orbital inclination (85.90 +0.19-0.18 degrees) and
transit timing (2454280.78186 +0.00015-0.00008 HJD). Assuming current planet
models, an internal structure similar to that of Neptune with a small H/He
envelope is necessary to account for the measured radius of GJ 436b.
"
What is the implementation of data-parallel clause evaluation for Aleph through the MPI interface?,"  This is to present work on modifying the Aleph ILP system so that it
evaluates the hypothesised clauses in parallel by distributing the data-set
among the nodes of a parallel or distributed machine. The paper briefly
discusses MPI, the interface used to access message- passing libraries for
parallel computers and clusters. It then proceeds to describe an extension of
YAP Prolog with an MPI interface and an implementation of data-parallel clause
evaluation for Aleph through this interface. The paper concludes by testing the
data-parallel Aleph on artificially constructed data-sets.
"
What is the effect of stellar compactness on the threshold for the onset of dynamical instabilities in neutron stars?,"  We present new results on dynamical instabilities in rapidly rotating
neutron-stars. In particular, using numerical simulations in full General
Relativity, we analyse the effects that the stellar compactness has on the
threshold for the onset of the dynamical bar-mode instability, as well as on
the appearance of other dynamical instabilities. By using an extrapolation
technique developed and tested in our previous study [1], we explicitly
determine the threshold for a wide range of compactnesses using four sequences
of models of constant baryonic mass comprising a total of 59 stellar models.
Our calculation of the threshold is in good agreement with the Newtonian
prediction and improves the previous post-Newtonian estimates. In addition, we
find that for stars with sufficiently large mass and compactness, the m=3
deformation is the fastest growing one. For all of the models considered, the
non-axisymmetric instability is suppressed on a dynamical timescale with an m=1
deformation dominating the final stages of the instability. These results,
together with those presented in [1], suggest that an m=1 deformation
represents a general and late-time feature of non-axisymmetric dynamical
instabilities both in full General Relativity and in Newtonian gravity.
"
"What is the color correction factor in X-ray binaries, and how is it determined observationally?","  We critically examine issues associated with determining the fundamental
properties of the black hole and the surrounding accretion disk in an X-ray
binary based on modeling the disk X-ray continuum of the source. We base our
work mainly on two XMM-Newton observations of GX 339-4, because they provided
high-quality data at low energies (below 1 keV) which are critical for reliably
modeling the spectrum of the accretion disk. A key issue examined is the
determination of the so-called ""color correction factor"", which is often
empirically introduced to account for the deviation of the local disk spectrum
from a blackbody (due to electron scattering). This factor cannot be
pre-determined theoretically because it may vary with, e.g., mass accretion
rate, among a number of important factors. We follow up on an earlier
suggestion to estimate the color correction observationally by modeling the
disk spectrum with saturated Compton scattering. We show that the spectra can
be fitted well and the approach yields reasonable values for the color
correction factor. For comparison, we have also attempted to fit the spectra
with other models. We show that even the high-soft-state continuum (which is
dominated by the disk emission) cannot be satisfactorily fitted by
state-of-the-art disk models. We discuss the implication of the results.
"
What is the role of the LSCC in the transcription network of S. cerevisiae?,"  We investigate the cycles in the transcription network of S. cerevisiae.
Unlike a similar network of E. coli, it contains many cycles. We characterize
properties of these cycles and their place in the regulatory mechanism of the
cell. Almost all cycles in the transcription network of S. cerevisiae are
contained in a single strongly connected component, which we call LSCC (L for
``largest''), except for a single cycle of two transcription factors. Among
different physiological conditions, cell cycle has the most significant
relationship with LSCC, as the set of 64 transcription interactions that are
active in all phases of the cell cycle has overlap of 27 with the interactions
of LSCC (of which there are 49). Conversely, if we remove the interactions that
are active in all phases of the cell cycle (fewer than 1% of the total), the
LSCC would have only three nodes and 5 edges, 4 of which are active only in the
stress response subnetwork. LSCC has a special place in the topology of the
network and it can be used to define a natural hierarchy in the network; in
every physiological subnetwork LSCC plays a pivotal role. Apart from those
well-defined conditions, the transcription network of S. cerevisiae is devoid
of cycles. It was observed that two conditions that were studied and that have
no cycles of their own are exogenous: diauxic shift and DNA repair, while cell
cycle, sporulation are endogenous.
"
What is the relationship between the k-cosymplectic and the k-symplectic Hamiltonian and Lagrangian formalisms?,"  The objective of this work is twofold: First, we analyze the relation between
the k-cosymplectic and the k-symplectic Hamiltonian and Lagrangian formalisms
in classical field theories. In particular, we prove the equivalence between
k-symplectic field theories and the so-called autonomous k-cosymplectic field
theories, extending in this way the description of the symplectic formalism of
autonomous systems as a particular case of the cosymplectic formalism in
non-autonomous mechanics. Furthermore, we clarify some aspects of the geometric
character of the solutions to the Hamilton-de Donder-Weyl and the
Euler-Lagrange equations in these formalisms. Second, we study the equivalence
between k-cosymplectic and a particular kind of multisymplectic Hamiltonian and
Lagrangian field theories (those where the configuration bundle of the theory
is trivial).
"
What are the conditions for the maximum oscillations of Tc?,"  When combining the BCS expression of Tc with a shear modulus constant model,
we can demonstrate that Tc oscillates depending on the number of the cuprate
planes and that it reaches its first maximum for three planes. This is in good
agreement with experimental data and suggests that the electron- phonon
coupling is essential to the superconductivity of the cuprates.
"
What are the parametric equations of the biharmonic Legendre curves?,"  We classify the biharmonic Legendre curves in a Sasakian space form, and
obtain their explicit parametric equations in the $(2n+1)$-dimensional unit
sphere endowed with the canonical and deformed Sasakian structures defined by
Tanno. Then, composing with the flow of the Reeb vector field, we transform a
biharmonic integral submanifold into a biharmonic anti-invariant submanifold.
Using this method we obtain new examples of biharmonic submanifolds in spheres
and, in particular, in $\mathbb{S}^{7}$.
"
What are the implications of the new experiments for the state of our knowledge of the $\nu p$ elastic cross section?,"  The recent parity-violating $ep$ forward-scattering elastic asymmetry data
from Jefferson Lab (HAPPEx and G0), when combined with the $\nu p$ elastic
cross section data from Brookhaven (E734), permit an extraction of the
strangeness contribution to the vector and axial nucleon form factors for
momentum transfers in the range $0.45 < Q^2 < 1.0$ GeV$^2$. These results,
combined with the recent determination of the strange vector form factors at
$Q^2 = 0.1$ GeV$^2$ (SAMPLE, HAPPEx, PVA4, G0) have been interpreted in terms
of $uuds\bar{s}$ configurations very different from the kaon-loop
configurations usually associated with strangeness in the nucleon. New
experiments are being proposed to improve the state of our knowledge of the
$\nu p$ elastic cross section -- these new experiments will push the range of
$Q^2$ to much lower values, and greatly increase the precision of the $\nu p$
elastic data. One outcome of this can be a measurement of the strangeness
contribution to the nucleon spin, $\Delta s$. Nuclear targets (e.g. C or Ar)
are to be used in these neutrino experiments, and so a deep understanding of
the nuclear physics, particularly in regard to final state effects, is needed
before the potential of these precision experiments can be fully realized.
"
What is the relationship between the renormalization prescriptions and the vacuum dependence on boundary conditions in quantum field theories?,"  The vacuum dependence on boundary conditions in quantum field theories is
analysed from a very general viewpoint. From this perspective the
renormalization prescriptions not only imply the renormalization of the
couplings of the theory in the bulk but also the appearance of a flow in the
space of boundary conditions. For regular boundaries this flow has a large
variety of fixed points and no cyclic orbit. The family of fixed points
includes Neumann and Dirichlet boundary conditions. In one-dimensional field
theories pseudoperiodic and quasiperiodic boundary conditions are also RG fixed
points. Under these conditions massless bosonic free field theories are
conformally invariant. Among all fixed points only Neumann boundary conditions
are infrared stable fixed points. All other conformal invariant boundary
conditions become unstable under some relevant perturbations. In finite volumes
we analyse the dependence of the vacuum energy along the trajectories of the
renormalization group flow providing an interesting framework for dark energy
evolution. On the contrary, the renormalization group flow on the boundary does
not affect the leading behaviour of the entanglement entropy of the vacuum in
one-dimensional conformally invariant bosonic theories.
"
What are the main algebraic properties of invertible modules?,"  After attaching explicitly to the M\""obius strip an invertible module over
the ring of real polynomial functions on the real circle, we expound as
directly as possible the many faces and the main algebraic properties of
invertible modules. The goal is to make this algebraic concept accessible to a
wide mathematical audience.

"What is the spin-lattice relaxation time, T1, of conduction electrons measured as a function of temperature and magnetic field in MgB2?","  The spin-lattice relaxation time, $T_{1}$, of conduction electrons is
measured as a function of temperature and magnetic field in MgB$_2$. The method
is based on the detection of the $z$ component of the conduction electron
magnetization under electron spin resonance conditions with amplitude modulated
microwave excitation. Measurement of $T_{1}$ below $T_c$ at 0.32 T allows to
disentangle contributions from the two Fermi surfaces of MgB$_{2}$ as this
field restores normal state on the Fermi surface part with $\pi$ symmetry only.
"
What is the definition of the ground state in the context of the gravitational field around two black holes?,"  An attempt to construct the ``ground state'' vacuum initial data for the
gravitational field surrounding two black holes is presented. The ground state
is defined as the gravitational initial data minimizing the ADM mass within the
class of data for which the masses of the holes and their distance are fixed.
To parameterize different geometric arrangements of the two holes (and,
therefore, their distance) we use an appropriately chosen scale factor. A
method for analyzing the variations of the ADM mass and the masses (areas) of
the horizons in terms of gravitational degrees of freedom is proposed. The
Misner initial data are analyzed in this context: it is shown that they do not
minimize the ADM mass.
"
What is the celebrated model of social segregation?,"  We investigate the static and dynamic properties of a celebrated model of
social segregation, providing a complete explanation of the mechanisms leading
to segregation both in one- and two-dimensional systems. Standard statistical
physics methods shed light on the rich phenomenology of this simple model,
exhibiting static phase transitions typical of kinetic constrained models,
nontrivial coarsening like in driven-particle systems and percolation-related
phenomena.
"
What is the relationship between Bell inequalities for two parties with binary observables and N possible local settings?,"  Derivation of the full set of Bell inequalities involving correlation
functions, for two parties, with binary observables, and N possible local
settings is not as easy as it seemed. The proof of v1 is wrong. Additionaly one
can find a counterexample, which will be presented soon. Thus our thesis is
dead. Still the series of Bell inequalities discussed in the manuscript (v1)
form a necessary condition for local realism, and are tight. They are tight and
complete (sufficient) only for N=3 settings per observer (as shown in
quant-ph/0611086, fortunately using an entirely different approach).
"
What is the origin of the X-ray activity in T Tauri Stars (TTS)?,"  Several aspects concerning the origin of the very strong X-ray activity of T
Tauri Stars (TTS) are still not well understood. Important new insight came
recently from the Chandra Orion Ultradeep Project (COUP), a unique 10-day long
Chandra observation of the Orion Nebula Cluster, and the XMM-Newton Extended
Survey of the Taurus Molecular Cloud (XEST). Based mainly on the results of
these two large projects, I will discuss our current knowledge about the
location of the X-ray emitting structures in TTS, the nature of their coronal
magnetic fields, inferences for pre-main-sequence magnetic dynamos, and the
relation between accretion processes and X-ray emission.

What are the advantages of the new algorithms implemented within the context of the Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG)?,"  To overcome the limitations of the traditional state-averaging approaches in
excited state calculations, where one solves for and represents all states
between the ground state and excited state of interest, we have investigated a
number of new excited state algorithms. Building on the work of van der Vorst
and Sleijpen (SIAM J. Matrix Anal. Appl., 17, 401 (1996)), we have implemented
Harmonic Davidson and State-Averaged Harmonic Davidson algorithms within the
context of the Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG). We have assessed
their accuracy and stability of convergence in complete active space DMRG
calculations on the low-lying excited states in the acenes ranging from
naphthalene to pentacene. We find that both algorithms offer increased accuracy
over the traditional State-Averaged Davidson approach, and in particular, the
State-Averaged Harmonic Davidson algorithm offers an optimal combination of
accuracy and stability in convergence.

"What are the growth trends of YouTube in various aspects, such as length, access pattern, and active life span?","  Established in 2005, YouTube has become the most successful Internet site
providing a new generation of short video sharing service. Today, YouTube alone
comprises approximately 20% of all HTTP traffic, or nearly 10% of all traffic
on the Internet. Understanding the features of YouTube and similar video
sharing sites is thus crucial to their sustainable development and to network
traffic engineering. In this paper, using traces crawled in a 3-month period,
we present an in-depth and systematic measurement study on the characteristics
of YouTube videos. We find that YouTube videos have noticeably different
statistics compared to traditional streaming videos, ranging from length and
access pattern, to their active life span, ratings, and comments. The series of
datasets also allows us to identify the growth trend of this fast evolving
Internet site in various aspects, which has seldom been explored before. We
also look closely at the social networking aspect of YouTube, as this is a key
driving force toward its success. In particular, we find that the links to
related videos generated by uploaders' choices form a small-world network. This
suggests that the videos have strong correlations with each other, and creates
opportunities for developing novel caching or peer-to-peer distribution schemes
to efficiently deliver videos to end users.
"
What is the saddle-point approximation used to treat larger samples of the weakly interacting Bose gas?,"  Fluctuations of the number of condensed atoms in a finite-size, weakly
interacting Bose gas confined in a box potential are investigated for
temperatures up to the critical region. The canonical partition functions are
evaluated using a recursive scheme for smaller systems, and a saddle-point
approximation for larger samples, that allows to treat realistic size systems
containing up to $N \sim 10^5$ particles. We point out the importance of
particle-number constrain and interactions between out of condensate atoms for
the statistics near the critical region. For sufficiently large systems the
crossover from the anomalous to normal scaling of the fluctuations is observed.
The excitations are described in a self-consistent way within the
Bogoliubov-Popov approximation, and the interactions between thermal atoms are
described by means of the Hartree-Fock method.
"
What are the emission features in the spectrum of a high redshift QSO?,"  We report the first detection of the 6.2micron and 7.7micron infrared `PAH'
emission features in the spectrum of a high redshift QSO, from the Spitzer-IRS
spectrum of the Cloverleaf lensed QSO (H1413+117, z~2.56). The ratio of PAH
features and rest frame far-infrared emission is the same as in lower
luminosity star forming ultraluminous infrared galaxies and in local PG QSOs,
supporting a predominantly starburst nature of the Cloverleaf's huge
far-infrared luminosity (5.4E12 Lsun, corrected for lensing). The Cloverleaf's
period of dominant QSO activity (Lbol ~ 7E13 Lsun) is coincident with an
intense (star formation rate ~1000 Msun/yr) and short (gas exhaustion time
~3E7yr) star forming event.
"
What is the Ricci flow in the Sobolev inequality in dimension 2?,"  In this paper we present our results on the logarithmic Sobolev inequality
along the Ricci flow in dimension 2.
"
How is gauging and reduction implemented in the Hitchin model?,"  We revisit our earlier work on the AKSZ formulation of topological sigma
model on generalized complex manifolds, or Hitchin model. We show that the
target space geometry geometry implied by the BV master equations is
Poisson--quasi--Nijenhuis geometry recently introduced and studied by Sti\'enon
and Xu (in the untwisted case). Poisson--quasi--Nijenhuis geometry is more
general than generalized complex geometry and comprises it as a particular
case. Next, we show how gauging and reduction can be implemented in the Hitchin
model. We find that the geometry resulting form the BV master equation is
closely related to but more general than that recently described by Lin and
Tolman, suggesting a natural framework for the study of reduction of
Poisson--quasi--Nijenhuis manifolds.
"
What is the role of circumstellar disks in regulating the rotation periods of young stars in young clusters?,"  Observations of PMS star rotation periods reveal slow rotators in young
clusters of various ages, indicating that angular momentum is somehow removed
from these rotating masses. The mechanism by which spin-up is regulated as
young stars contract has been one of the longest-standing problems in star
formation. Attempts to observationally confirm the prevailing theory that
magnetic interaction between the star and its circumstellar disk regulates
these rotation periods have produced mixed results. In this paper, we use the
unprecedented disk identification capability of the Spitzer Space Telescope to
test the star-disk interaction paradigm in two young clusters, NGC 2264 and the
Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC). We show that once mass effects and sensitivity
biases are removed, a clear increase in the disk fraction with period can be
observed in both clusters across the entire period range populated by cluster
members. We also show that the long-period peak (P $\sim$8 days) of the bimodal
distribution observed for high-mass stars in the ONC is dominated by a
population of stars possessing a disk, while the short-period peak (P $\sim$2
days) is dominated by a population of stars without a disk. Our results
represent the strongest evidence to date that star-disk interaction regulates
the angular momentum of these young stars. This study will make possible
quantitative comparisons between the observed period distributions of stars
with and without a disk and numerical models of the angular momentum evolution
of young stars.
"
"How do the electroweak radiative corrections affect the transverse momentum distribution of W bosons, particularly at large transverse momenta?","  To match the precision of present and future measurements of W-boson
production at hadron colliders electroweak radiative corrections must be
included in the theory predictions. In this paper we consider their effect on
the transverse momentum (p_T) distribution of W bosons, with emphasis on large
p_T. We evaluate the full electroweak O(alpha) corrections to the processes pp
-> W+jet and p\bar p -> W+jet including virtual and real photonic
contributions. We present the explicit expressions in analytical form for the
virtual corrections and provide results for the real corrections, discussing in
detail the treatment of soft and collinear singularities. We also provide
compact approximate expressions which are valid in the high-energy region,
where the electroweak corrections are strongly enhanced by logarithms of
\hat{s}/M_W^2. These expressions describe the complete asymptotic behaviour at
one loop as well as the leading and next-to-leading logarithms at two loops.
Numerical results are presented for proton-proton collisions at 14 TeV and
proton-antiproton collisions at 2 TeV. The corrections are negative and their
size increases with p_T. At the LHC, where transverse momenta of 2 TeV or more
can be reached, the one- and two-loop corrections amount up to -40% and +10%,
respectively, and will be important for a precise analysis of W production. At
the Tevatron, transverse momenta up to 300 GeV are within reach. In this case
the electroweak corrections amount up to -10% and are thus larger than the
expected statistical error.
"
What are the characteristics of the polarized sources detected in the ELAIS N1 region?,"  We present deep polarimetric observations at 1420 MHz of the European Large
Area ISO Survey North 1 region (ELAIS N1) as part of the Dominion Radio
Astrophysical Observatory Planck Deep Fields project. By combining closely
spaced aperture synthesis fields, we image a region of 7.43 square degrees to a
maximum sensitivity in Stokes Q and U of 78 microJy/beam, and detect 786
compact sources in Stokes I. Of these, 83 exhibit polarized emission. We find
that the differential source counts (log N - log p) for polarized sources are
nearly constant down to p > 500 microJy, and that these faint polarized radio
sources are more highly polarized than the strong source population. The median
fractional polarization is (4.8 +/- 0.7)% for polarized sources with Stokes I
flux density between 1 and 30 mJy; approximately three times larger than
sources with I > 100 mJy. The majority of the polarized sources have been
identified with galaxies in the Spitzer Wide Area Infrared Extragalactic Survey
(SWIRE) image of ELAIS N1. Most of the galaxies occupy regions in the IRAC
5.8/3.6 micron vs. 8.0/4.5 micron color-color diagram associated with dusty
AGNs, or with ellipticals with an aging stellar population. A few host galaxies
have colors that suggests significant PAH emission in the near-infrared. A
small fraction, 12%, of the polarized sources are not detected in the SWIRE
data. None of the polarized sources in our sample appears to be associated with
an actively star-forming galaxy.
"
What is the power law in the Mdot - Z relation of Wolf-Rayet stars?,"  To better understand Wolf-Rayet stars as progenitors of gamma-ray bursts, an
understanding of the effect metallicity has on Wolf-Rayet mass loss is needed.
Using simple analytic models, we study the Mdot - Z relation of a WN star and
compare the results to similar models. We find that Mdot roughly follows a
power law in Z with index 0.88 from -2.5 < log Z/Z_sun < -1 and appears to
flatten by log Z/Z_sun ~ -0.5.
"
What are the results of non-radiative cosmological simulations of a preheated intracluster medium?,"  We perform a set of non--radiative cosmological simulations of a preheated
intracluster medium in which the entropy of the gas was uniformly boosted at
high redshift. The results of these simulations are used first to test the
current analytic techniques of preheating via entropy input in the smooth
accretion limit. When the unmodified profile is taken directly from
simulations, we find that this model is in excellent agreement with the results
of our simulations. This suggests that preheated efficiently smoothes the
accreted gas, and therefore a shift in the unmodified profile is a good
approximation even with a realistic accretion history. When we examine the
simulation results in detail, we do not find strong evidence for entropy
amplification, at least for the high-redshift preheating model adopted here. In
the second section of the paper, we compare the results of the preheating
simulations to recent observations. We show -- in agreement with previous work
-- that for a reasonable amount of preheating, a satisfactory match can be
found to the mass-temperature and luminosity-temperature relations. However --
as noted by previous authors -- we find that the entropy profiles of the
simulated groups are much too flat compared to observations. In particular,
while rich clusters converge on the adiabatic self--similar scaling at large
radius, no single value of the entropy input during preheating can
simultaneously reproduce both the core and outer entropy levels. As a result,
we confirm that the simple preheating scenario for galaxy cluster formation, in
which entropy is injected universally at high redshift, is inconsistent with
observations.
"
What is the attractor mechanism for the four-dimensional supergravity black hole solution?,"  The attractor mechanism for the four-dimensional ${\cal N}=2$ supergravity
black hole solution is analyzed in the case of the D0-D4 system. Our analyses
are based on newly derived exact solutions, which exhibit explicitly the
attractor mechanism for extremal non-BPS black holes. Our solutions account for
the moduli as general complex fields, while in almost all non-BPS solutions
obtained previously, the moduli fields are restricted to be purely imaginary.
It is also pointed out that our moduli solutions contain an extra parameter
that is not contained in solutions obtained by replacing the charges in the
double extremal moduli solutions by the corresponding harmonic functions.
"
What is the best-fit photoionization model for the extended emission-line region (EELR) around the quasar 4C 37.43?,"  We present Gemini integral field spectroscopy and Keck II longslit
spectroscopy of the extended emission-line region (EELR) around the quasar 4C
37.43. The velocity structure of the ionized gas is complex and cannot be
explained globally by a simple dynamical model. The spectra from the clouds are
inconsistent with shock or ``shock + precursor'' ionization models, but they
are consistent with photoionization by the quasar nucleus. The best-fit
photoionization model requires a low-metallicity (12+log(O/H) < 8.7) two-phase
medium, consisting of a matter-bounded diffuse component with a unity
filling-factor (N ~ 1 \cc, T ~ 15000 K), in which are embedded small, dense
clouds (N ~ 400 \cc, T ~ 10^4 K). The high-density clouds are transient and can
be re-generated through compressing the diffuse medium by low-speed shocks (V_S
\lesssim 100 \kms). Our photoionization model gives a total mass for the
ionized gas of about 3x10^{10} M_sun, and the total kinetic energy implied by
this mass and the observed velocity field is ~2x10^{58} ergs. The fact that
luminous EELRs are confined to steep-spectrum radio-loud quasars, yet show no
morphological correspondence to the radio jets, suggests that the driving force
producing the 4C 37.43 EELR was a roughly spherical blast wave initiated by the
production of the jet. That such a mechanism seems capable of ejecting a mass
comparable to that of the total interstellar medium of the Milky Way suggests
that ``quasar-mode'' feedback may indeed be an efficient means of regulating
star formation in the early universe.
"
What are the Hamilton equations of motion of the Universe from the graviton-matter gas viewpoint?,"  We present basics of conceptually new-type way for explaining of the origin,
evolution and current physical properties of our Universe from the
graviton-matter gas viewpoint. Quantization method for the Friedmann-Lemaitre
Universe based on the canonical Hamilton equations of motion is proposed and
quantum information theory way to physics of the Universe is showed. The
current contribution from the graviton-matter gas temperature in quintessence
approximation is discussed.
"
What is the set of integers below $x$ composed only of prime factors below $y$?,"  For a wide range of $x$ and $y$ we show that ${\Cal S}(x,y)$, the set of
integers below $x$ composed only of prime factors below $y$, is equidistributed
in the reduced residue classes $\pmod q$ for all $q<y^{4\sqrt{e}-\epsilon}$.
This improves earlier work of Granville; any improvement of this range of $q$
would have interesting consequences for Vinogradov's conjecture on the least
quadratic non-residue. For larger ranges of $q$ we prove the existence of a
large subgroup of the group of reduced residues such that ${\Cal S}(x,y)$ is
equidistributed within cosets of that subgroup.
"
What is the relationship between the classical construction of the Gauss-Manin connection and the localized category of differential complexes?,"  In the dictionary between the language of (algebraic integrable) connections
and that of (algebraic) $\cD$-modules, to compare the definitions of inverse
images for connections and $\cD$-modules is easy. But the comparison between
direct images for connections (the classical construction of the Gauss-Manin
connection for smooth morphisms) and for $\cD$-modules, although known to
specialists, has been explicitly proved only recently in a paper of Dimca,
Maaref, Sabbah and Saito in 2000, where the authors' main technical tool was M.
Saito's equivalence between the derived category of $\cD$-modules and a
localized category of differential complexes. The aim of this short paper is to
give a simplified summary of the [DMSS] argument, and to propose an alternative
proof of this comparison which is simpler, in the sense that it does not use
Saito equivalence. Moreover, our alternative strategy of comparison works in a
context which is a precursor to the Gauss-Manin connection (at the level of
$f^{-1}\cD_Y$-modules, for a morphism $f:X\to Y$), and may be of some intrinsic
interest.
"
What is the role of the U(1) ghost field in the 1/Nc expansion of QCD?,"  The 1/Nc expansion is one of the very few methods we have for generating a
systematic expansion of QCD at the energy scale relevant to hadron structure.
The present formulation of this theory relies on the double-line notation for
calculating the leading order of a diagram in the 1/Nc expansion, where the
local SU(Nc) gauge symmetry is substituted by a U(Nc) symmetry and the
associated U(1) ghost field is ignored. In the current work we demonstrate the
insufficiency of this formulation for describing certain non-planar diagrams.
We derive a more complete set of Feynman rules that include the U(1) ghost
field and provide a useful tool for calculating both color factors and 1/Nc
orders of all color-singlet diagrams.
"
What is the quantum interference of multiple scattering amplitudes in hadronic collisions?,"  We calculate the multiple scattering effect on single hadron production in
semi-inclusive lepton-nucleus deeply inelastic scattering. We show that the
quantum interference of multiple scattering amplitudes leads to suppression in
hadron productions. At the leading power in medium length, the suppression can
be approximately expressed in terms of a shift in $z$ of the fragmentation
function $D(z)$, and could be therefore interpreted as the collisional energy
loss. We compare our calculation with existing experimental data. We also
discuss the effect of quark mass on the suppression. Our approach can be
extended to other observables in hadronic collisions.
"
What are the kinematics of the remnant of SN 1987A analyzed by matching individual filaments to the echelle spectra obtained at CTIO?,"  We present a multiwavelength analysis of the supernova remnant N49 in the
Large Magellanic Cloud. Using high-resolution Hubble Space Telescope WFPC2
images of H-alpha, [S II] and [O III] emission, we study the morphology of the
remnant and calculate the rms electron densities in different regions. We
detect an offset of [O III] and H-alpha emission of about 0.5 arcsec, and
discuss possible scenarios that could give rise to such high values. The
kinematics of the remnant is analyzed by matching individual filaments to the
echelle spectra obtained at CTIO. We detect narrow H-alpha emission component
which we identify as the diffuse post-shock recombination radiation, and
discrete broad emission features that correspond to the shocked gas in
filaments. The overall expansion of the remnant is about 250 km/s. The dense
clouds are shocked up to line-of-sight velocities of 250 km/s and the less
dense gas up to 300 km/s. A few cloudlets have even higher radial velocities,
reaching up to 350 km/s. We confirm the presence of the cavity in the remnant,
and identify the center of explosion. Using archival Chandra and XMM-Newton
data, we observe the same trends in surface brightness distribution for the
optical and X-ray images. We carry out the spectral analysis of three regions
that represent the most significant optical features.
"
What is the geometry of the flux rope that determines the magnetic field orientation and helicity of the flux rope?,"  We describe a method to measure the magnetic field orientation of coronal
mass ejections (CMEs) using Faraday rotation (FR). Two basic FR profiles,
Gaussian-shaped with a single polarity or ""N""-like with polarity reversals, are
produced by a radio source occulted by a moving flux rope depending on its
orientation. These curves are consistent with the Helios observations,
providing evidence for the flux-rope geometry of CMEs. Many background radio
sources can map CMEs in FR onto the sky. We demonstrate with a simple flux rope
that the magnetic field orientation and helicity of the flux rope can be
determined 2-3 days before it reaches Earth, which is of crucial importance for
space weather forecasting. An FR calculation based on global
magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of CMEs in a background heliosphere shows
that FR mapping can also resolve a CME geometry curved back to the Sun. We
discuss implementation of the method using data from the Mileura Widefield
Array (MWA).
"
What are the frequencies of the harmonics emitted by the graphene layer?,"  It is shown that the massless energy spectrum of electrons and holes in
graphene leads to the strongly non-linear electromagnetic response of this
system. We predict that the graphene layer, irradiated by electromagnetic
waves, emits radiation at higher frequency harmonics and can work as a
frequency multiplier. The operating frequency of the graphene frequency
multiplier can lie in a broad range from microwaves to the infrared.
"
What are the implications of the internal conversion of the stau-nucleus in the bound state?,"  Modification of standard big-bang nucleosynthesis is considered in the
minimal supersymmetric standard model to resolve the excessive theoretical
prediction of the abundance of primordial lithium 7. We focus on the stau as a
next-lightest superparticle, which is long lived due to its small mass
difference with the lightest superparticle. It provides a number of additional
decay processes of $\mathrm{^{7}Li}$ and $\mathrm{^{7}Be}$. A particularly
important process is the internal conversion in the stau-nucleus bound state,
which destroys the $\mathrm{^{7}Li}$ and $\mathrm{^{7}Be}$ effectively. We show
that the modification can lead to a prediction consistent with the observed
abundance of $\mathrm{^{7}Li}$.
"
What is the role of supernova feedback in the collapse of isolated dwarf galaxies?,"  We simulate the collapse of isolated dwarf galaxies using SPH + N-Body
simulations including a physically motivated description of the effects of
supernova feedback. As the gas collapses and stars form, the supernova feedback
disrupts enough gas to temporarily quench star formation. The gas flows outward
into a hot halo, where it cools until star formation can continue once more and
the cycle repeats. The star formation histories of isolated Local Group dwarf
galaxies exhibit similar episodic bursts of star formation. We examine the mass
dependence of the stellar velocity dispersions and find that they are no less
than half the velocity of the halos measured at the virial radius.
"
What are the peculiar motions of clusters of galaxies in the Ursa Major supercluster?,"  We have investigated the peculiar motions of clusters of galaxies in the Ursa
Major (UMa) supercluster and its neighborhood. Based on SDSS (Sloan Digital Sky
Survey) data, we have compiled a sample of early-type galaxies and used their
fundamental plane to determine the cluster distances and peculiar velocities.
The samples of early-type galaxies in the central regions (within R_200) of 12
UMa clusters of galaxies, in three main subsystems of the supercluster -- the
filamentary structures connecting the clusters, and in nine clusters from the
nearest UMa neighborhood have similar parameters. The fairly high overdensity
(3 by the galaxy number and 15 by the cluster number) suggests that the
supercluster as a whole is gravitationally bound, while no significant peculiar
motions have been found: the peculiar velocities do not exceed the measurement
errors by more than a factor of 1.5-2. The mean random peculiar velocities of
clusters and the systematic deviations from the overall Hubble expansion in the
supercluster are consistent with theoretical estimates. For the possible
approach of the three UMa subsystems to be confirmed, the measurement accuracy
must be increased by a factor of 2-3.
"
power series with coefficients in the Poisson center of K[X]^G?,"  Let G be a connected reductive group over an algebraically closed field K of
characteristic 0, X an affine symplectic variety equipped with a Hamiltonian
action of G. Further, let * be a G-invariant Fedosov star-product on X such
that the Hamiltonian action is quantized. We establish an isomorphism between
the center of the associative algebra K[X][[h]]^G and the algebra of formal
power series with coefficients in the Poisson center of K[X]^G.
"
What role do phase relationships of small scales play in the Large Eddy Simulation model?,"  We present a new version of a dynamical spectral model for Large Eddy
Simulation based on the Eddy Damped Quasi Normal Markovian approximation
\cite{sao,chollet_lesieur}. Three distinct modifications are implemented and
tested. On the one hand, whereas in current approaches, a Kolmogorov-like
energy spectrum is usually assumed in order to evaluate the nonlocal transfer,
in our method the energy spectrum of the subgrid scales adapts itself
dynamically to the large-scale resolved spectrum; this first modification
allows in particular for a better treatment of transient phases and
instabilities, as shown on one specific example. Moreover, the model takes into
account the phase relationships of the small-scales, embodied for example in
strong localized structures such as vortex filaments. To that effect, phase
information is implemented in the treatment of the so-called eddy noise in the
closure model. Finally, we also consider the role that helical small scales may
play in the evaluation of the transfer of energy and helicity, the two
invariants of the primitive equations in the inviscid case; this leads as well
to intrinsic variations in the development of helicity spectra. Therefore, our
model allows for simulations of flows for a variety of circumstances and a
priori at any given Reynolds number. Comparisons with Direct Numerical
Simulations of the three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equation are performed on
fluids driven by an ABC (Beltrami) flow which is a prototype of fully helical
flows. Good agreements are obtained for physical and spectral behavior of the
large scales.
"
What is the relationship between the charge dynamics and the optical parameters in the metal-to-insulator transition in La(2/3)Sr(1/3)Mn(1-x)Ga(x)O(3)?,"  In a metallic manganite like La(2/3)Sr(1/3)MnO(3), the substitution of Mn(+3)
by Ga(+3) dilutes the ferromagnetic order and locally cancels the Jahn-Teller
distortion, without heavily affecting the crystal structure. One can thus
follow the changes in the charge dynamics induced by Ga, until the
ferro-metallic manganite is turned into an insulator. Here this phenomenon is
studied in detail through the infrared reflectivity of five samples of
La(2/3)Sr(1/3)Mn(1-x)Ga(x)O(3), with x increasing from 0 to 0.30 and for 50 < T
< 320 K. A simple model which links the measured optical parameters to the
magnetization M(x, T) well describes the behavior of the plasma frequency, the
scattering rate, and the mid-infrared absorption along the metal-to-insulator
transition.
"
How is the distinct spin wave modes observed in a ferromagnet with finite size?,"  We explore the possibility to manipulate massive, i.e. motional, degrees of
freedom of trapped ions. In particular, we demonstrate that, if local control
of the trapping frequencies is achieved, one can reproduce the full toolbox of
linear optics on radial modes. Furthermore, assuming only global control of the
trapping potential, we show that unprecedented degrees of continuous variable
entanglement can be obtained and that nonlocality tests with massive degrees of
freedom can be carried out.
"
What is the relationship between the control of the velocity and the direction of the vorticity in a flow?,"  In this short note, we give a link between the regularity of the solution $u$
to the 3D Navier-Stokes equation, and the behavior of the direction of the
velocity $u/|u|$. It is shown that the control of $\Div (u/|u|)$ in a suitable
$L_t^p(L_x^q)$ norm is enough to ensure global regularity. The result is
reminiscent of the criterion in terms of the direction of the vorticity,
introduced first by Constantin and Fefferman. But in this case the condition is
not on the vorticity, but on the velocity itself. The proof, based on very
standard methods, relies on a straightforward relation between the divergence
of the direction of the velocity and the growth of energy along streamlines.
"
What are the implications of the periodic arrangement of particles for the propagation of solitary waves?,"  We report the propagation of highly nonlinear solitary waves in
heterogeneous, periodic granular media using experiments, numerical
simulations, and theoretical analysis. We examine periodic arrangements of
particles in experiments in which stiffer/heavier beads (stainless steel) are
alternated with softer/lighter ones (PTFE beads). We find excellent agreement
between experiments and numerics in a model with Hertzian interactions between
adjacent beads, which in turn agrees very well with a theoretical analysis of
the model in the long-wavelength regime that we derive for heterogeneous
environments and general bead interactions. Our analysis encompasses
previously-studied examples as special cases and also provides key insights on
the influence of the dimer lattice on the properties (width and propagation
speed) of the obtained highly nonlinear wave solutions.
"
What are the implications of the quantum Zeno effect on the average decay rate of a metastable quantum system?,"  This article deals with the problem of gathering information on the time
evolution of a single metastable quantum system whose evolution is impeded by
the quantum Zeno effect. It has been found it is in principle possible to
obtain some information on the time evolution and, depending on the specific
system, even to measure its average decay rate, even if the system does not
undergo any evolution at all.
"
What is the relationship between corruption level and economic factors such as country wealth and foreign investment?,"  We report quantitative relations between corruption level and economic
factors, such as country wealth and foreign investment per capita, which are
characterized by a power law spanning multiple scales of wealth and investments
per capita. These relations hold for diverse countries, and also remain stable
over different time periods. We also observe a negative correlation between
level of corruption and long-term economic growth. We find similar results for
two independent indices of corruption, suggesting that the relation between
corruption and wealth does not depend on the specific measure of corruption.
The functional relations we report have implications when assessing the
relative level of corruption for two countries with comparable wealth, and for
quantifying the impact of corruption on economic growth and foreign
investments.
"
How have the accelerations of the high velocity maser components been measured?,"  A wealth of new information about the structure of the maser disk in NGC 4258
has been obtained from a series of 18 VLBA observations spanning three years,
as well as from 32 additional epochs of spectral monitoring data from 1994 to
the present, acquired with the VLA, Effelsberg, and GBT. The warp of the disk
has been defined precisely. The thickness of the maser disk has been measured
to be 12 microarcseconds (FWHM), which is slightly smaller than previously
quoted upper limits. Under the assumption that the masers trace the true
vertical distribution of material in the disk, from the condition of
hydrostatic equilibrium the sound speed is 1.5 km/s, corresponding to a thermal
temperature of 600K. The accelerations of the high velocity maser components
have been accurately measured for many features on both the blue and red side
of the spectrum. The azimuthal offsets of these masers from the midline (the
line through the disk in the plane of the sky) and derived projected offsets
from the midline based on the warp model correspond well with the measured
offsets. This result suggests that the masers are well described as discrete
clumps of masing gas, which accurately trace the Keplerian motion of the disk.
However, we have continued to search for evidence of apparent motions caused by
``phase effects.'' This work provides the foundation for refining the estimate
of the distance to NGC 4258 through measurements of feature acceleration and
proper motion. The refined estimate of this distance is expected to be
announced in the near future.
"
What is the relationship between the phase transition of the alkanol monolayer and the interfacial structure at the oil/water interface?,"  This study of adsorption of normal alkanols at the oil/water interface with
x-ray reflectivity and tensiometry demonstrates that the liquid to gas
monolayer phase transition at the hexane/water interface is thermodynamically
favorable only for long-chain alkanols. As the alkanol chain length is
decreased, the change in excess interfacial entropy per area decreases to zero.
Systems with small values of excess interfacial entropy form multi-molecular
layers at the interface instead of the monolayer formed by systems with much
larger excess interfacial entropy. Substitution of n-hexane by n-hexadecane
significantly alters the interfacial structure for a given alkanol surfactant,
but this substitution does not change fundamentally the phase transition
behavior of the monolayers. These data show that the critical alkanol carbon
number, at which the change in excess interfacial entropy per area decreases to
zero, is approximately six carbons larger than the number of carbons in the
alkane solvent molecules.
"
What is the Cauchy-Riemann operator in Clifford variables?,"  In this thesis, we show the existence of a sequence of differential operators
starting with with the Dirac operator in k Clifford variables, $D=(D_1,...,
D_k)$, where $D_i=\sum_j e_j\cdot \partial_{ij}: C^\infty((\R^n)^k,\S)\to
C^\infty((\R^n)^k,\S)$ ($\S$ is the spinor module). This operator is the
Cauchy-Riemann operator for n=2 and its resolution is the Dolbeault complex.
For higher n, the resolution of D is not known in general. While this problem
was treated many times in the language of Clifford analysis and some partial
results are known, we give a description of this operator in Parabolic
geometry, which is a special type of Cartan geometry modeled on $G/P$, where P
is a Parabolic subgroup of G. We construct sequences of invariant differential
operators starting with the Dirac operator in several variables and assume that
these sequences coinside in some cases with the resolution. We describe the
structure of these sequences precisely in case the dimension $n$ is odd and
give a conjecture that these sequences have similar structure for n even,
$k\leq n/2$ (the s.c. {\it stable range}). We also give some information about
these sequences in case n even, k>n/2. In the last chapter, explicite formulas
for the operators are derived for the case k=2.
"
What is the neutrino mass matrix in the left-right symmetric model?,"  We propose two Type-II seesaw scenarios for the neutrino mass matrix in the
left-right symmetric model, in which the Higgs triplet Yukawa coupling matrix
takes the appealing Friedberg-Lee texture. We show that the nearly
tri-bimaximal neutrino mixing pattern, which is especially favored by current
neutrino oscillation data, can be obtained from both scenarios. We also show
that the cosmological baryon number asymmetry can naturally be interpreted in
these two scenarios via the flavor-independent leptogenesis mechanism.
"
What is the lifetime of the metastable liquid state estimated based on the classical theory of homogeneous nucleation?,"  A numerical hydrodynamic study of femtosecond laser ablation is presented. A
detailed analysis of material decomposition is performed using a
thermodynamically complete equation of state with separate stable and
metastable phase states and phase boundaries. The lifetime of the metastable
liquid state is estimated based on the classical theory of homogeneous
nucleation. In addition, mechanical fragmentation of the target material is
controlled based on available criteria. As a result, several ablation
mechanisms are observed. A major fraction of the ablated material, however, is
found to originate from the metastable liquid region, which is decomposed
either thermally in the vicinity of the critical point into a liquid-gas
mixture, or mechanically at high strain rate and negative pressure into liquid
droplets and chunks. The calculation results explain available experimental
findings.
"
How do the number of links to other stocks in a network affect the correlation between the stocks in the network?,"  The stock market has been known to form homogeneous stock groups with a
higher correlation among different stocks according to common economic factors
that influence individual stocks. We investigate the role of common economic
factors in the market in the formation of stock networks, using the arbitrage
pricing model reflecting essential properties of common economic factors. We
find that the degree of consistency between real and model stock networks
increases as additional common economic factors are incorporated into our
model. Furthermore, we find that individual stocks with a large number of links
to other stocks in a network are more highly correlated with common economic
factors than those with a small number of links. This suggests that common
economic factors in the stock market can be understood in terms of
deterministic factors.
"
What is the behavior of the scaling functions for the data from BRAHMS?,"  With the experimental data from STAR and PHENIX on the centrality dependence
of the $p_T$ spectra of protons and anti-protons produced at mid-rapidity in
Au+Au collisions at 200 GeV, we show that for protons and anti-protons there
exists a scaling distribution independent of the colliding centrality. The
scaling functions can also describe data from BRAHMS for both proton and
anti-proton spectra at $y=2.2$ and 3.2. The scaling behaviors are shown to be
incompatible with the usual string fragmentation scenario for particle
production.
"
What are the thermoelectric signatures of quantum criticality in the vicinity of the field-induced quantum critical point?,"  We present a study of thermoelectric coefficients in CeCoIn_5 down to 0.1 K
and up to 16 T in order to probe the thermoelectric signatures of quantum
criticality. In the vicinity of the field-induced quantum critical point, the
Nernst coefficient nu exhibits a dramatic enhancement without saturation down
to lowest measured temperature. The dimensionless ratio of Seebeck coefficient
to electronic specific heat shows a minimum at a temperature close to threshold
of the quasiparticle formation. Close to T_c(H), in the vortex-liquid state,
the Nernst coefficient behaves anomalously in puzzling contrast with other
superconductors and standard vortex dynamics.
"
What is the exact analytical description of extreme intensity statistics in complex random states?,"  An exact analytical description of extreme intensity statistics in complex
random states is derived. These states have the statistical properties of the
Gaussian and Circular Unitary Ensemble eigenstates of random matrix theory.
Although the components are correlated by the normalization constraint, it is
still possible to derive compact formulae for all values of the dimensionality
N. The maximum intensity result slowly approaches the Gumbel distribution even
though the variables are bounded, whereas the minimum intensity result rapidly
approaches the Weibull distribution. Since random matrix theory is conjectured
to be applicable to chaotic quantum systems, we calculate the extreme
eigenfunction statistics for the standard map with parameters at which its
classical map is fully chaotic. The statistical behaviors are consistent with
the finite-N formulae.
"
How is the tiling problem related to the undecidability problem?,"  In this paper, we complete the construction of paper arXiv:cs.CG/0701096v2.
Together with the proof contained in arXiv:cs.CG/0701096v2, this paper
definitely proves that the general problem of tiling the hyperbolic plane with
{\it \`a la} Wang tiles is undecidable.
"
What are the assumptions on the initial data used to prove the blow-up?,"  The blow-up in finite time for the solutions to the initial-boundary value
problem associated to the multi-dimensional quantum hydrodynamic model in a
bounded domain is proved. The model consists on conservation of mass equation
and a momentum balance equation equivalent to a compressible Euler equations
corrected by a dispersion term of the third order in the momentum balance. The
proof is based on a-priori estimates for the energy functional for a new
observable constructed with an auxiliary function, and it is shown that, under
suitable boundary conditions and assumptions on the initial data, the solution
blows up after a finite time.
"
What is the period of the accreting white dwarf SDSSJ091945.10+085710.0?,"  We report the discovery of two new accreting pulsating white dwarf stars
amongst the cataclysmic variables of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey:
SDSSJ074531.91+453829.5 and SDSSJ091945.10+085710.0. We observe high amplitude
non-sinusoidal variations of 4.5-7% at a period close to 1230s in the optical
light curves of SDSSJ074531.91+453829.5 and a low amplitude variation of
0.7-1.6% near 260s in the light curves of SDSSJ091945.10+085710.0. We infer
that these optical variations are a consequence of nonradial g-mode pulsations
in the accreting primary white dwarfs of these cataclysmic variables. However
we cannot rule out the remote possibility that the 260s period could be the
spin period of the accreting white dwarf SDSSJ091945.10+085710.0. We also
uncovered a non-variable SDSSJ171145.08+301320.0 during our search; our two
observing runs exclude any pulsation related periodicities in the range of
85-1400s with an amplitude greater than or equal to 0.5%. This discovery paper
brings the total number of known accreting white dwarf pulsators to eleven.
"
What are the implications of generalized Stallings' methods for the amalgams of finite groups?,"  Geometric methods proposed by Stallings for treating finitely generated
subgroups of free groups were successfully used to solve a wide collection of
decision problems for free groups and their subgroups.
  It turns out that Stallings' methods can be effectively generalized for the
class of amalgams of finite groups. In the present paper we employ subgroup
graphs constructed by the generalized Stallings' folding algorithm to solve
various algorithmic problems in amalgams of finite groups.
"
What are the implications of the straggler identification problem on the design of deterministic and randomized solutions?,"  We introduce the straggler identification problem, in which an algorithm must
determine the identities of the remaining members of a set after it has had a
large number of insertion and deletion operations performed on it, and now has
relatively few remaining members. The goal is to do this in o(n) space, where n
is the total number of identities. The straggler identification problem has
applications, for example, in determining the set of unacknowledged packets in
a high-bandwidth multicast data stream. We provide a deterministic solution to
the straggler identification problem that uses only O(d log n) bits and is
based on a novel application of Newton's identities for symmetric polynomials.
This solution can identify any subset of d stragglers from a set of n O(log
n)-bit identifiers, assuming that there are no false deletions of identities
not already in the set. Indeed, we give a lower bound argument that shows that
any small-space deterministic solution to the straggler identification problem
cannot be guaranteed to handle false deletions. Nevertheless, we show that
there is a simple randomized solution using O(d log n log(1/epsilon)) bits that
can maintain a multiset and solve the straggler identification problem,
tolerating false deletions, where epsilon>0 is a user-defined parameter
bounding the probability of an incorrect response. This randomized solution is
based on a new type of Bloom filter, which we call the invertible Bloom filter.
"
What is the criterion for quantifying the resources used by the ensemble implementation?,"  We compare pseudopure state ensemble implementations, quantified by their
initial polarization and ensemble size, of Grover's search algorithm to
probabilistic classical sequential search algorithms in terms of their success
and failure probabilities. We propose a criterion for quantifying the resources
used by the ensemble implementation via the aggregate number of oracle
invocations across the entire ensemble and use this as a basis for comparison
with classical search algorithms. We determine bounds for a critical
polarization such that the ensemble algorithm succeeds with a greater
probability than the probabilistic classical sequential search. Our results
indicate that the critical polarization scales as N^(-1/4) where N is the
database size and that for typical room temperature solution state NMR, the
polarization is such that the ensemble implementation of Grover's algorithm
would be advantageous for N > 10^22
"
What is the eikonal approximation to graviton exchange in AdS_5 space?,"  We explore the eikonal approximation to graviton exchange in AdS_5 space, as
relevant to scattering in gauge theories. We restrict ourselves to the regime
where conformal invariance of the dual gauge theory holds, and to large 't
Hooft coupling where the computation involves pure gravity. We give a heuristic
argument, a direct loop computation, and a shock wave derivation. The scalar
propagator in AdS_3 plays a key role, indicating that even at strong coupling,
two-dimensional conformal invariance controls high-energy four-dimensional
gauge-theory scattering.
"
What are the probabilistic solutions of the semilinear PDE's and PDE's with obstacle under monotonicity condition?,"  We prove the existence and uniqueness of the solution of a semilinear PDE's
and also PDE's with obstacle under monotonicity condition. Moreover we give the
probabilistic interpretation of the Sobolev's solutions in term of Backward SDE
and reflected Backward SDE respectively.
"
How does the environmental temperature affect the quantum oscillations in a double quantum dot system?,"  The quantum oscillations of population in an asymmetric double quantum dots
system coupled to a phonon bath are investigated theoretically. It is shown how
the environmental temperature has effect on the system.
"
What is the quasi-local formula for the linear momentum of black-hole horizons?,"  We propose a quasi-local formula for the linear momentum of black-hole
horizons inspired by the formalism of quasi-local horizons. We test this
formula using two complementary configurations: (i) by calculating the large
orbital linear momentum of the two black holes in an unequal-mass, zero-spin,
quasi-circular binary and (ii) by calculating the very small recoil momentum
imparted to the remnant of the head-on collision of an equal-mass,
anti-aligned-spin binary. We obtain results consistent with the horizon
trajectory in the orbiting case, and consistent with the net radiated linear
momentum for the much smaller head-on recoil velocity.
"
What is the nature of the outbursts in the Supergiant Fast X-ray Transient (SFXT) IGR J11215-5952?,"  IGR J11215-5952 is a hard X-ray transient source discovered in April 2005
with INTEGRAL and a confirmed member of the new class of High Mass X-ray
Binaries, the Supergiant Fast X-ray Transients (SFXTs). Archival INTEGRAL data
and RXTE observations showed that the outbursts occur with a periodicity of
~330 days. Thus, IGR J11215-5952 is the first SFXT displaying periodic
outbursts, possibly related to the orbital period. We performed a Target of
Opportunity observation with Swift with the main aim of monitoring the source
behaviour around the time of the fifth outburst, expected on 2007 Feb 9. The
source field was observed with Swift twice a day (2ks/day) starting from 4th
February, 2007, until the fifth outburst, and then for ~5 ks a day afterwards,
during a monitoring campaign that lasted 23 days for a total on-source exposure
of ~73 ks. This is the most complete monitoring campaign of an outburst from a
SFXT. The spectrum during the brightest flares is well described by an absorbed
power law with a photon index of 1 and N_H~1 10^22 cm^-2. A 1-10 keV peak
luminosity of ~10^36 erg s^-1 was derived (assuming 6.2 kpc, the distance of
the optical counterpart). These Swift observations are a unique data-set for an
outburst of a SFXT, thanks to the combination of sensitivity and time coverage,
and they allowed a study of IGR J11215-5952 from outburst onset to almost
quiescence. We find that the accretion phase lasts longer than previously
thought on the basis of lower sensitivity instruments observing only the
brightest flares. The observed phenomenology is consistent with a smoothly
increasing flux triggered at the periastron passage in a wide eccentric orbit
with many flares superimposed, possibly due to episodic or inhomogeneous
accretion.
"
What is the effect of introducing the rotating potential adiabatically on the rotation frequency of the condensate?,"  We theoretically examine the rotation of an atomic Bose-Einstein condensate
in an elliptical trap, both in the absence and presence of a quantized vortex.
Two methods of introducing the rotating potential are considered -
adiabatically increasing the rotation frequency at fixed ellipticity, and
adiabatically increasing the trap ellipticity at fixed rotation frequency.
Extensive simulations of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation are employed to map out
the points where the condensate becomes unstable and ultimately forms a vortex
lattice. We highlight the key features of having a quantized vortex in the
initial condensate. In particular, we find that the presence of the vortex
causes the instabilities to shift to lower or higher rotation frequencies,
depending on the direction of the vortex relative to the trap rotation.
"
What are the implications of the joint distribution and marginal distributions of default times?,"  In this paper, a geometric function is introduced to reflect the attenuation
speed of impact of one firm's default to its partner. If two firms are
competitions (copartners), the default intensity of one firm will decrease
(increase) abruptly when the other firm defaults. As time goes on, the impact
will decrease gradually until extinct. In this model, the joint distribution
and marginal distributions of default times are derived by employing the change
of measure, so can we value the fair swap premium of a CDS.
"
What is the estimated mass-loss rate of the progenitor star of SN 2004et?,"  We present X-ray, broad band optical and low frequency radio observations of
the bright type IIP supernova SN 2004et. The \cxo observed the supernova at
three epochs, and the optical coverage spans a period of $\sim$ 470 days since
explosion. The X-ray emission softens with time, and we characterise the X-ray
luminosity evolution as $\Lx \propto t^{-0.4}$. We use the observed X-ray
luminosity to estimate a mass-loss rate for the progenitor star of $\sim
\ee{2}{-6} M_\odot \mathrm{yr}^{-1}$. The optical light curve shows a
pronounced plateau lasting for about 110 days. Temporal evolution of
photospheric radius and color temperature during the plateau phase is
determined by making black body fits. We estimate the ejected mass of $^{56}$Ni
to be 0.06 $\pm$ 0.03 M$_\odot$. Using the expressions of Litvinova &
Nad\""{e}zhin (1985) we estimate an explosion energy of (0.98 $\pm$ 0.25)
$\times 10^{51}$ erg. We also present a single epoch radio observation of SN
2004et. We compare this with the predictions of the model proposed by Chevalier
et al. (2006). These multi-wavelength studies suggest a main sequence
progenitor mass of $\sim$ 20 M$_\odot$ for SN 2004et.
"
What is the global existence theorem for the tangential derivative of a wave in three dimensions?,"  We consider wave equations in three space dimensions, and obtain new weighted
$L^\infty$-$L^\infty$ estimates for a tangential derivative to the light cone.
As an application, we give a new proof of the global existence theorem, which
was originally proved by Klainerman and Christodoulou, for systems of nonlinear
wave equations under the null condition. Our new proof has the advantage of
using neither the scaling nor the pseudo-rotation operators.
"
What are the implications of the result of the theorem on the concept of a quasiconformal homeomorphism?,"  By applying holomorphic motions, we prove that a parabolic germ is
quasiconformally rigid, that is, any two topologically conjugate parabolic
germs are quasiconformally conjugate and the conjugacy can be chosen to be more
and more near conformal as long as we consider these germs defined on smaller
and smaller neighborhoods. Before proving this theorem, we use the idea of
holomorphic motions to give a conceptual proof of the Fatou linearization
theorem. As a by-product, we also prove that any finite number of analytic
germs at different points in the Riemann sphere can be extended to a
quasiconformal homeomorphism which can be more and more near conformal as as
long as we consider these germs defined on smaller and smaller neighborhoods of
these points.
"
What are the relationships between the Mathieu and Mathieu groups?,"  We consider the Zassenhaus conjecture for the normalized unit group of the
integral group ring of the Mathieu sporadic group $M_{24}$. As a consequence,
for this group we confirm Kimmerle's conjecture on prime graphs.
"
What are the results of the measurements of the single-particle density of states (SPDOS) in a cold 2DES?,"  Spectroscopic methods involving the sudden injection or ejection of electrons
in materials are a powerful probe of electronic structure and interactions.
These techniques, such as photoemission and tunneling, yield measurements of
the ""single particle"" density of states (SPDOS) spectrum of a system. The SPDOS
is proportional to the probability of successfully injecting or ejecting an
electron in these experiments. It is equal to the number of electronic states
in the system able to accept an injected electron as a function of its energy
and is among the most fundamental and directly calculable quantities in
theories of highly interacting systems. However, the two-dimensional electron
system (2DES), host to remarkable correlated electron states such as the
fractional quantum Hall effect, has proven difficult to probe
spectroscopically. Here we present an improved version of time domain
capacitance spectroscopy (TDCS) that now allows us to measure the SPDOS of a
2DES with unprecedented fidelity and resolution. Using TDCS, we perform
measurements of a cold 2DES, providing the first direct measurements of the
single-particle exchange-enhanced spin gap and single particle lifetimes in the
quantum Hall system, as well as the first observations of exchange splitting of
Landau levels not at the Fermi surface. The measurements reveal the difficult
to reach and beautiful structure present in this highly correlated system far
from the Fermi surface.
"
What are the kinematic properties of the inner and outer halos of the Milky Way?,"  The halo of the Milky Way provides unique elemental abundance and kinematic
information on the first objects to form in the Universe, which can be used to
tightly constrain models of galaxy formation and evolution. Although the halo
was once considered a single component, evidence for its dichotomy has slowly
emerged in recent years from inspection of small samples of halo objects. Here
we show that the halo is indeed clearly divisible into two broadly overlapping
structural components -- an inner and an outer halo -- that exhibit different
spatial density profiles, stellar orbits and stellar metallicities (abundances
of elements heavier than helium). The inner halo has a modest net prograde
rotation, whereas the outer halo exhibits a net retrograde rotation and a peak
metallicity one-third that of the inner halo. These properties indicate that
the individual halo components probably formed in fundamentally different ways,
through successive dissipational (inner) and dissipationless (outer) mergers
and tidal disruption of proto-Galactic clumps.
"
What is the behavior of the carrier density as the wavelength is varied?,"  We report magnetotransport properties of photogenerated electrons in undoped
SrTiO$_3$ single crystals under ultraviolet illumination down to 2 K. By tuning
the light intensity, the steady state carrier density can be controlled, while
tuning the wavelength controls the effective electronic thickness by modulating
the optical penetration depth. At short wavelengths, when the sheet conductance
is close to the two-dimensional Mott minimum conductivity we have observed
critical behavior characteristic of weak localization. Negative
magnetoresistance at low magnetic field is highly anisotropic, indicating
quasi-two-dimensional electronic transport. The high mobility of photogenerated
electrons in SrTiO$_3$ allows continuous tuning of the effective electronic
dimensionality by photoexcitation.
"
What is the role of the Higgs particle in the theory of particle physics?,"  The Higgs particle is a new elementary particle predicted in the Standard
Model of the elementary particle physics. It plays a special role in the theory
of mass generation of quarks, leptons, and gauge bosons. In this article,
theoretical issues on the Higgs mechanism are first discussed, and then
experimental prospects on the Higgs particle study at the future collider
experiments, LHC and ILC, are reviewed. The Higgs coupling determination is an
essential step to establish the mass generation mechanism, which could lead to
a deeper understanding of particle physics.
"
What are the properties of the continuum of mutually nonisomorphic C^*-algebras?,"  We study the universal C^*-algebras generated by n projections $p_1, >...,
p_n$ subject to the relation $p_1+... p_n = \lambda 1$, $\lambda \in \mathbb
R$. The questions of when these C^*-algebras are type I, nuclear or exact are
considered. It is proved also that among these algebras there is continuum of
mutually nonisomorphic ones.
"
What is the flux of such particles through the Earth that could be observed?,"  Astrophysical sources of energetic gamma rays provide the right conditions
for maximal mixing between (pseudo)scalar (axion-like) particles and photons if
their coupling is as strong as suggested by the PVLAS claim. This is
independent of whether or not the axion interaction is standard at all energies
or becomes supressed in the extreme conditions of the stellar interior. The
flux of such particles through the Earth could be observed using a metre long,
Tesla strength superconducting solenoid thus testing the axion interpretation
of the PVLAS anomaly. The rate of events in CAST caused by axions from the Crab
pulsar is also estimated for the PVLAS-favoured parameters.
"
What are the key differences between the transformation-based and variation-based methods?,"  In this note we contrast two transformation-based methods to deduce absolute
extrema and the corresponding extremizers. Unlike variation-based methods, the
transformation-based ones of Carlson and Leitmann and the recent one of Silva
and Torres are direct in that they permit obtaining solutions by inspection.
"
What is the relationship between the magnetic Schrödinger operator and the spectral radius?,"  In this paper we consider magnetic Schr\""odinger operators in R^n, n \ge 3.
Under almost optimal conditions on the potentials in terms of decay and
regularity we prove smoothing and Strichartz estimates, as well as a limiting
absorption principle. For large gradient perturbations the latter is not a
corollary of the free case as the differentiated free resolvent does not have
small operator norm on any weighted L^2 spaces.
  We instead show that the spectral radius of such operators decreases to zero,
hence their perturbation of the identity is still invertible. The key estimates
are based on an angular decomposition of the free resolvent, or rather a bound
that holds uniformly for all possible angular decompositions. The proof avoids
the Fourier transform and instead uses H\""ormander's variable coefficient
Plancherel theorem for oscillatory integrals.
"
What is the mechanism that provides a partial stabilization of the flow in the case of transonic flows?,"  The long term magnetohydrodynamic stability of magnetized
transonic/supersonic jets is numerically investigated using a spatial approach.
We focus on two-dimensional linearly-unstable slab configurations where the jet
is embedded in a flow-aligned uniform magnetic field of weak amplitude. We
compare our results with previous studies using a temporal approach where
longitudinally periodic domains were adopted. The finite-volume based versatile
advection code (VAC) is used to solve the full set of ideal compressible MHD
equations. We follow the development of Kelvin-Helmholtz modes that are driven
by a white noise perturbation continuously introduced at the jet inlet. No
noticeable difference is observed in spatial simulations versus analogous
temporal ones during the linear and early non-linear evolution of the
configuration. However, in the case of transonic flows, a different long-term
scenario occurs in our spatial runs. Indeed, after the large-scale disruption
of the flow, a sheath region of enhanced magnetic field encompassing the jet
core forms along the whole flow. This provides a partial stabilization
mechanism leading to enhanced stability for later times, which is almost
independent of the initial magnitude of the magnetic field. The implication of
this mechanism for the stability of astrophysical jets is discussed.

What is the renormalization group used to construct gauge invariant equations for the fields of the open string?,"  The exact renormalization group is applied to the world sheet theory
describing bosonic open string backgrounds to obtain the equations of motion
for the fields of the open string. Using loop variable techniques the equations
can be constructed to be gauge invariant. Furthermore they are valid off the
(free) mass shell. This requires keeping a finite cutoff. Thus we have the
interesting situation of a scale invariant world sheet theory with a finite
world sheet cutoff. This is possible because there are an infinite number of
operators whose coefficients can be tuned. This is in the same sense that
""perfect actions"" or ""improved actions"" have been proposed in lattice gauge
theory to reproduce the continuum results even while keeping a finite lattice
spacing.
"
What are the conditions under which mean-field scaling breaks down in interacting systems?,"  We considered diffusion-driven processes on small-world networks with
distance-dependent random links. The study of diffusion on such networks is
motivated by transport on randomly folded polymer chains, synchronization
problems in task-completion networks, and gradient driven transport on
networks. Changing the parameters of the distance-dependence, we found a rich
phase diagram, with different transient and recurrent phases in the context of
random walks on networks. We performed the calculations in two limiting cases:
in the annealed case, where the rearrangement of the random links is fast, and
in the quenched case, where the link rearrangement is slow compared to the
motion of the random walker or the surface. It has been well-established that
in a large class of interacting systems, adding an arbitrarily small density
of, possibly long-range, quenched random links to a regular lattice interaction
topology, will give rise to mean-field (or annealed) like behavior. In some
cases, however, mean-field scaling breaks down, such as in diffusion or in the
Edwards-Wilkinson process in ""low-dimensional"" small-world networks. This
break-down can be understood by treating the random links perturbatively, where
the mean-field (or annealed) prediction appears as the lowest-order term of a
naive perturbation expansion. The asymptotic analytic results are also
confirmed numerically by employing exact numerical diagonalization of the
network Laplacian. Further, we construct a finite-size scaling framework for
the relevant observables, capturing the cross-over behaviors in finite
networks. This work provides a detailed account of the
self-consistent-perturbative and renormalization approaches briefly introduced
in two earlier short reports.
"
What is the upper limit on the cross-section of the prompt production of χc1 and χc2 in e+e- annihilations?,"  We have searched for prompt production of $\chi_{c1}$, $\chi_{c2}$ and
X(3872) in continuum e^+e^- annihilations using a 386 fb^{-1} data sample
collected around $\sqrt{s} = 10.6$ GeV with the BABAR detector using the
$\gamma J/\psi$ decay mode. After accounting for the feed-down from
$\psi(2S)\to\gamma\chi_{c1,2}$, no significant signal for prompt $\chi_{c1,2}$
production is observed. We present improved upper limits on the cross-section,
with the rest of the event consisting of more than two charged tracks, to be 77
fb for $\chi_{c1}$ and 79 fb for $\chi_{c2}$ with $e^+e^-$ center-of-mass frame
$\chi_c$ momentum greater than 2.0 GeV at 90% confidence level. These limits
are consistent with NRQCD predictions. We also set an upper limit on the prompt
production of X(3872) through the decay $X(3872)\to \gamma J/\psi$.
"
nubar_mu u dbar X near the W-pair production threshold?,"  In this talk, I review the effective theory approach to unstable particle
production and present results of a calculation of the process e- e+ ->mu-
nubar_mu u dbar X near the W-pair production threshold up to next-to-leading
order in GammaW/MW ~ alpha ~ v^2. The remaining theoretical uncertainty and the
impact on the measurement of the W mass is discussed.
"
What is the criterion of guaranteed estimation error finiteness for linear 2-point BVP?,"  In this paper we study observation problem for linear 2-point BVP Dx=Bf
assuming that information about system input f and random noise \eta in system
state observation model y=Hx+\eta$ is incomplete (f and M\eta\eta' are some
arbitrary elements of given sets). A criterion of guaranteed (minimax)
estimation error finiteness is proposed. Representations of minimax estimations
are obtained in terms of 2-point BVP solutions. It is proved that in general
case we can only estimate a projection of system state onto some linear
manifold $F$. In particular, $F=L_2$ if $dim N(D H) = 0$. Also we propose a
procedure which decides if given linear functional belongs to $F$.
"
What is the relationship between dietary fat storage and physical inactivity in obesity?,"  OBJECTIVES: Changes in the way dietary fat is metabolized can be considered
causative in obesity. The role of sedentary behavior in this defect has not
been determined. We hypothesized that physical inactivity partitions dietary
fats toward storage and that a resistance exercise training program mitigates
storage.
"
What is the momentum space density profile in the first Brillouin zone for the Bose condensation of cold atoms in an optical lattice at finite temperature?,"  We discuss the experimental signal for the Bose condensation of cold atoms in
an optical lattice at finite temperature. Instead of using the visibility of
the interference pattern via the time-of-flight imaging, we show that the
momentum space density profile in the first Brillouin zone, in particular its
bimodal distribution, provides an unambiguous signal for the Bose condensation.
We confirm this point with detailed calculation of the change in the atomic
momentum distribution across the condensation phase transition, taking into
account both the global trapping potential and the atomic interaction effects.
"
What is the vdW-DF approach used to investigate the bonding in the potassium-graphite compound?,"  Potassium intercalation in graphite is investigated by first-principles
theory. The bonding in the potassium-graphite compound is reasonably well
accounted for by traditional semilocal density functional theory (DFT)
calculations. However, to investigate the intercalate formation energy from
pure potassium atoms and graphite requires use of a description of the graphite
interlayer binding and thus a consistent account of the nonlocal dispersive
interactions. This is included seamlessly with ordinary DFT by a van der Waals
density functional (vdW-DF) approach [Phys. Rev. Lett. 92, 246401 (2004)]. The
use of the vdW-DF is found to stabilize the graphite crystal, with crystal
parameters in fair agreement with experiments. For graphite and
potassium-intercalated graphite structural parameters such as binding
separation, layer binding energy, formation energy, and bulk modulus are
reported. Also the adsorption and sub-surface potassium absorption energies are
reported. The vdW-DF description, compared with the traditional semilocal
approach, is found to weakly soften the elastic response.
"
What is the role of Lorentz invariance and pomeron loops in the evolution of high-energy scattering?,"  Recent theoretical progress in understanding high-energy scattering beyond
the mean field approximation is reviewed. The role of Lorentz invariance and
pomeron loops in the evolution, the relation between high-energy QCD and
statistical physics and results for the saturation momentum and the scattering
amplitude are discussed.
"
What is the quantumness of correlations in bipartite states?,"  A novel measure, quantumness of correlations is introduced here for bipartite
states, by incorporating the required measurement scheme crucial in defining
any such quantity. Quantumness coincides with the previously proposed measures
in special cases and it vanishes for separable states - a feature not captured
by the measures proposed earlier. It is found that an optimal generalized
measurement on one of the parts leaves the overall state in its closest
separable form, which shares the same marginal for the other part, implying
that quantumness is non-zero for all entangled bipartite states and it serves
as an upper bound to the relative entropy of entanglement.
"
What is the significance of the $\Delta\phi$ cut in the analysis?,"  We present simulation results of $\gamma$ + Jet analysis using CMS (Compact
Muon Solenoid) Object-Oriented software at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC)
center of mass energy $\sqrt{s}$=14 TeV. The study of direct photon production
helps in validating the perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics (pQCD) and
providing information on the gluon distribution in the nucleons. Direct photon
processes also constitute a major background to several other Standard Model
(SM) processes and signals of new physics. Thus these processes need to be
understood precisely in the new energy regime. In this work, we have done a
detailed study of the GEANT4 simulated $\gamma$ + jet events generated with
Pythia, and the related background processes. Isolation cuts have been
optimized for direct photon which improves the signal over background ratio by
$\sim25%$ as compared to previous studies done in CMS. The inclusion of a large
$\Delta\phi$ cut between the photon and the leading jet at $40^0$ in the
analysis leads to a further increase of $\sim15%$ in S/B, thus giving an
overall gain of $\sim42%$ in S/B ratio.
"
What are the implications of the kinetic energy spectra for the isotopic composition of the particles?,"  Light charged particles emitted at about 90 deg in the frame of the
projectile-like fragment in semi-peripheral collisions of 93Nb+93Nb at 38A MeV
give evidence for the simultaneous occurrence of two different production
mechanisms. This is demonstrated by differences in the kinetic energy spectra
and in the isotopic composition of the particles. The emission with a softer
kinetic energy spectrum and a low N/Z ratio for the hydrogen isotopes is
attributed to an evaporation process. The harder emission, with a much higher
N/Z ratio, can be attributed to a ``midvelocity'' process consisting of a
non-isotropic emission, on a short time-scale, from the surface of the
projectile-like fragment.
"
What are the phase transitions observed in the temperature range 90K to 470K?,"  Dielectric measurements on 0.65[Pb(Ni_1/3Nb_2/3)O_3]-0.35PbTiO_3 ceramic in
the temperature range 90K to 470K shows a relaxor ferroelectric transition
around 350K with a Vogel-Fulcher freezing temperature of 338K and appearance of
a non-ergodic relaxor ferroelectric phase of tetragonal structure at room
temperature. This non-ergodic phase reenters into the relaxor state at low
temperatures as evidenced by the appearance of a frequency dependent anomaly in
the imaginary part of the dielectric constant around 160K, similar to those
reported in other relaxor ferroelectric based morphotropic phase boundary
ceramics. The polarization relaxation time for the 160K anomaly also follows
Vogel-Fulcher type temperature dependence. Temperature dependent magnetization
measurements show that this low temperature anomaly is not linked with any
magnetic transition. Elastic modulus and low temperature x-ray diffraction
(XRD) measurements reveal a tetragonal to monoclinic phase transition around
225K. It is argued that the low temperature dielectric dispersion around 160K
results from the freezing of mesoscopic conformally miniaturized monoclinic
domains formed inside the parent tetragonal domains below the structural phase
transition temperature of 225K.
"
What are the 1981 parameters used in the Schrödinger equation for quarkonium and muonic atoms and alcaline atoms?,"  We review various inequalities on the order and the spacing of energy levels,
wave function at the origin, etc... which were obtained since 1977 in the
framework of the Schrodinger equation and applied to quarkonium and also to
muonic atoms and alcaline atoms. We also present a fit of mesons and baryons
made of b, c, s quarks and antiquarks, keeping the 1981 parameters and
comparing with present experimental data.
"
What is the implication of the results for the determination of the fundamental properties of black holes and accretion disks?,"  We critically examine issues associated with determining the fundamental
properties of the black hole and the surrounding accretion disk in an X-ray
binary based on modeling the disk X-ray continuum of the source. We base our
work mainly on two XMM-Newton observations of GX 339-4, because they provided
high-quality data at low energies (below 1 keV) which are critical for reliably
modeling the spectrum of the accretion disk. A key issue examined is the
determination of the so-called ""color correction factor"", which is often
empirically introduced to account for the deviation of the local disk spectrum
from a blackbody (due to electron scattering). This factor cannot be
pre-determined theoretically because it may vary with, e.g., mass accretion
rate, among a number of important factors. We follow up on an earlier
suggestion to estimate the color correction observationally by modeling the
disk spectrum with saturated Compton scattering. We show that the spectra can
be fitted well and the approach yields reasonable values for the color
correction factor. For comparison, we have also attempted to fit the spectra
with other models. We show that even the high-soft-state continuum (which is
dominated by the disk emission) cannot be satisfactorily fitted by
state-of-the-art disk models. We discuss the implication of the results.
"
What is the equation of a massless scalar field solved numerically under the boundary conditions near the inner horizon and the outer horizon?,"  After the nontrivial quantum parameters $\Omega_{n}$ and quantum potentials
$V_{n}$ obtained in our previous research, the circumstance of a real scalar
wave in the bulk is studied with the similar method of Brevik (2001). The
equation of a massless scalar field is solved numerically under the boundary
conditions near the inner horizon $r_{e}$ and the outer horizon $r_{c}$. Unlike
the usual wave function $\Psi_{\omega l}$ in 4D, quantum number $n$ introduces
a new functions $\Psi_{\omega l n}$, whose potentials are higher and wider with
bigger n. Using the tangent approximation, a full boundary value problem about
the Schr$\ddot{o}$dinger-like equation is solved. With a convenient replacement
of the 5D continuous potential by square barrier, the reflection and
transmission coefficients are obtained. If extra dimension does exist and is
visible at the neighborhood of black holes, the unique wave function
$\Psi_{\omega l n}$ may say something to it.
"
What are the implications of the superfluidity of para-hydrogen clusters in terms of their physical properties?,"  It is shown by computer simulations that superfluid {\it para}-hydrogen
clusters of more than 22 molecules can be turned insulating and ""solidlike"" by
the replacement of as few as one or two molecules, with ones of the heavier
{\it ortho}-deuterium isotope. A much smaller effect is observed with
substitutional {\it ortho}-hydrogen. Substitutional {\it ortho}-deuterium
molecules prevalently sit in the inner part of the cluster, whereas {\it
ortho}-hydrogen impurities reside primarily in the outer shell, near the
surface. Implications on the superfluidity of pure {\it para}-hydrogen clusters
are discussed.
"
What is the scale height of the distribution of YOCs and OB stars respectively?,"  We have carried out a comparative statistical study for the displacement of
the Sun from the Galactic plane (z_\odot) following three different methods.
The study has been done using a sample of 537 young open clusters (YOCs) with
log(Age) < 8.5 lying within a heliocentric distance of 4 kpc and 2030 OB stars
observed up to a distance of 1200 pc, all of them have distance information. We
decompose the Gould Belt's member in a statistical sense before investigating
the variation in the z_\odot estimation with different upper cut-off limits in
the heliocentric distance and distance perpendicular to the Galactic plane. We
found z_\odot varies in a range of ~ 13 - 20 pc from the analys is of YOCs and
~ 6 - 18 pc from the OB stars. A significant scatter in the z_\odot obtained
due to different cut-off values is noticed for the OB stars although no such
deviation is seen for the YOCs. We also determined scale heights of
56.9(+3.8)(-3.4} and 61.4(+2.7)(-2.4) pc for the distribution of YOCs and OB
stars respectively.
"
What is the decoherence process in a particle in a ring with finite size?,"  The motion of a particle in a ring of length L is influenced by a dirty metal
environment whose fluctuations are characterized by a short correlation
distance $\ell << L$. We analyze the induced decoherence process, and compare
the results with those obtained in the opposing Caldeira-Leggett limit ($\ell
>> L$). A proper definition of the dephasing factor that does not depend on a
vague semiclassical picture is employed. Some recent Monte-Carlo results about
the effect of finite temperatures on ""mass renormalization"" in this system are
illuminated.
"
How does the structure of a network influence the properties of dynamical processes?,"  The structure of a network can significantly influence the properties of the
dynamical processes which take place on them. While many studies have been
devoted to this influence, much less attention has been devoted to the
interplay and feedback mechanisms between dynamical processes and network
topology on adaptive networks. Adaptive rewiring of links can happen in real
life systems such as acquaintance networks where people are more likely to
maintain a social connection if their views and values are similar. In our
study, we consider different variants of a model for consensus formation. Our
investigations reveal that the adaptation of the network topology fosters
cluster formation by enhancing communication between agents of similar opinion,
though it also promotes the division of these clusters. The temporal behavior
is also strongly affected by adaptivity: while, on static networks, it is
influenced by percolation properties, on adaptive networks, both the early and
late time evolution of the system are determined by the rewiring process. The
investigation of a variant of the model reveals that the scenarios of
transitions between consensus and polarized states are more robust on adaptive
networks.
"
"What is the role of gravity in the position, size and temperature of the MOT?","  The intercombination line of Strontium at 689nm is successfully used in laser
cooling to reach the photon recoil limit with Doppler cooling in a
magneto-optical traps (MOT). In this paper we present a systematic study of the
loading efficiency of such a MOT. Comparing the experimental results to a
simple model allows us to discuss the actual limitation of our apparatus. We
also study in detail the final MOT regime emphasizing the role of gravity on
the position, size and temperature along the vertical and horizontal
directions. At large laser detuning, one finds an unusual situation where
cooling and trapping occur in the presence of a high bias magnetic field.
"
What are the implications of the frequency of the outbursts for the validity of the model?,"  Recently, strong AGN outbursts at the centers of galaxy clusters have been
found. Using a simple model, we study particle acceleration around a shock
excited by an outburst and estimate nonthermal emission from the accelerated
particles. We show that emission from secondary electrons is consistent with
the radio observations of the minihalo in the Perseus cluster, if there was a
strong AGN outburst >~10^8 yrs ago with an energy of ~1.8x10^62 erg. The
validity of our model depends on the frequency of the large outbursts. We also
estimate gamma-ray emission from the accelerated particles and show that it
could be detected with GLAST.
"
What are the differences between probability limits and pointwise limits?,"  It has recently been shown that the marginalization paradox (MP) can be
resolved by interpreting improper inferences as probability limits. The key to
the resolution is that probability limits need not satisfy the formal Bayes'
law, which is used in the MP to deduce an inconsistency. In this paper, I
explore the differences between probability limits and the more familiar
pointwise limits, which do imply the formal Bayes' law, and show how these
differences underlie some key differences in the interpretation of the MP.
"
"How does the distribution of metals in galaxies relate to their mass, morphology, and age?","  We combine stellar metallicity and stellar mass estimates for a large sample
of galaxies drawn from the SDSS DR2 spanning wide ranges in physical
properties, in order to derive an inventory of the total mass of metals and
baryons locked up in stars today. Physical parameter estimates are derived from
galaxy spectra with high S/N (>20). Coadded spectra of galaxies with similar
velocity dispersions, absolute r-band magnitudes and 4000\AA-break values are
used for those regions of parameter space where individual spectra have lower
S/N. We estimate the total density of metals and of baryons in stars and, from
these two quantities, we obtain a mass- and volume-averaged stellar metallicity
of <Z_star>=1.04+-0.14 Z_sun, i.e. consistent with solar. We also study how
metals are distributed in galaxies according to their mass, morphology and age,
and we then compare these distributions with the corresponding distributions of
stellar mass. We find that the bulk of metals locked up in stars in the local
Universe reside in massive, bulge-dominated galaxies, with red colours and high
4000\AA-break values corresponding to old stellar populations. Bulge-dominated
and disc-dominated galaxies contribute similar amounts to the total stellar
mass density, but have different fractional contributions to the mass density
of metals in stars, in agreement with the mass-metallicity relation.
Bulge-dominated galaxies contain roughly 40% of the total amount of metals in
stars, while disc-dominated galaxies less than 25%. Finally, at a given galaxy
stellar mass, we define two characteristic ages as the median of the
distributions of mass and metals as a function of age. These characteristic
ages decrease progressively from high-mass to low-mass galaxies, consistent
with the high formation epochs of stars in massive galaxies.
"
What is the number of n-Poncelet pairs for a fixed curve K and a family of curves L?,"  We show that for a fixed curve $K$ and for a family of variables curves $L$,
the number of $n$-Poncelet pairs is $\frac{e (n)}{2}$, where $e(n)$ is the
number of natural numbers $m$ smaller than $n$ and which satisfies mcd $
(m,n)=1$. The curvee $K$ do not have to be part of the family.
  In order to show this result we consider an associated billiard
transformation and a twist map which preserves area.
  We use Aubry-Mather theory and the rotation number of invariant curves to
obtain our main result.
  In the last section we estimate the derivative of the rotation number of a
general twist map using some properties of the continued fraction expansion .
"
,"  In this paper, we introduce some explicit approximations for the summation
$\sum_{k\leq n}\Omega(k)$, where $\Omega(k)$ is the total number of prime
factors of $k$.
"
What is the Boltzmann transport analysis used to explain the interlayer magnetoresistance of overdoped Tl2Ba2CuO6+δ?,"  The angle-dependent interlayer magnetoresistance of overdoped
Tl$_2$Ba$_2$CuO$_{6+\delta}$ has been measured in high magnetic fields up to 45
Tesla. A conventional Boltzmann transport analysis with no basal-plane
anisotropy in the cyclotron frequency $\omega_c$ or transport lifetime $\tau$
is shown to be inadequate for explaining the data. We describe in detail how
the analysis can be modified to incorporate in-plane anisotropy in these two
key quantities and extract the degree of anisotropy for each by assuming a
simple four-fold symmetry. While anisotropy in $\omega_c$ and other Fermi
surface parameters may improve the fit, we demonstrate that the most important
anisotropy is that in the transport lifetime, thus confirming its role in the
physics of overdoped superconducting cuprates.
"
How does the operator G relate to the analysis of the decay of correlation for this process?,"  Starting with basic axioms of quantum theory I revisit ""Relative State
Interpretation'' set out 50 years ago by Hugh Everett.
"
What are the three possible implementations of the seesaw mechanisms?,"  Patterns of flavor violation induced by neutrino Yukawa couplings are
discussed in realistic ``minimal'' SUSY SU(5) models, obtained by adding
nonrenormalizable operators to the minimal one, in order to fix the fermion
spectrum and suppress proton decay. Results are presented for the three
possible implementations of the seesaw mechanisms, i.e. of Type I, II and III.
"
What is the Bauer-Furuta class of invariants for 4-manifolds with b_1 = 0 and b_+ = 1?,"  Starting from ideas of Furuta, we develop a general formalism for the
construction of cohomotopy invariants associated with a certain class of
$S^1$-equivariant non-linear maps between Hilbert bundles. Applied to the
Seiberg-Witten map, this formalism yields a new class of cohomotopy
Seiberg-Witten invariants which have clear functorial properties with respect
to diffeomorphisms of 4-manifolds. Our invariants and the Bauer-Furuta classes
are directly comparable for 4-manifolds with $b_1=0$; they are equivalent when
$b_1=0$ and $b_+>1$, but are finer in the case $b_1=0$, $b_+=1$ (they detect
the wall-crossing phenomena).
  We study fundamental properties of the new invariants in a very general
framework. In particular we prove a universal cohomotopy invariant jump formula
and a multiplicative property. The formalism applies to other gauge theoretical
problems, e.g. to the theory of gauge theoretical (Hamiltonian) Gromov-Witten
invariants.
"
How can the Local Unitary operations be used to relate the different types of three-qubit states with sets of equivalence classes?,"  We present a classification of three-qubit states based in their three-qubit
and reduced two-qubit entanglements. For pure states these criteria can be
easily implemented, and the different types can be related with sets of
equivalence classes under Local Unitary operations. For mixed states
characterization of full tripartite entanglement is not yet solved in general;
some partial results will be presented here.
"
What is the ratio of the kinetic power of a radio source to the Eddington luminosity?,"  We investigate the total kinetic powers (L_{j}) and ages (t_{age}) of
powerful jets of four FR II radio sources (Cygnus A, 3C 223, 3C 284, and 3C
219) by the detail comparison of the dynamical model of expanding cocoons with
observed ones. It is found that these sources have quite large kinetic powers
with the ratio of L_{j} to the Eddington luminosity (L_{Edd}) resides in $0.02
<L_{j}/L_{Edd} <10$. Reflecting the large kinetic powers, we also find that the
total energy stored in the cocoon (E_{c}) exceed the energy derived from the
minimum energy condition (E_{min}): $2< E_{c}/E_{min} <160$. This implies that
a large amount of kinetic power is carried by invisible components such as
thermal leptons (electron and positron) and/or protons.
"
What is the atmosphere of the star GD 362 dominated by?,"  GD 362 is a massive white dwarf with a spectrum suggesting a H-rich
atmosphere which also shows very high abundances of Ca, Mg, Fe and other
metals. However, for pure H-atmospheres the diffusion timescales are so short
that very extreme assumptions have to be made to account for the observed
abundances of metals. The most favored hypothesis is that the metals are
accreted from either a dusty disk or from an asteroid belt. Here we propose
that the envelope of GD 362 is dominated by He, which at these effective
temperatures is almost completely invisible in the spectrum. This assumption
strongly alleviates the problem, since the diffusion timescales are much larger
for He-dominated atmospheres. We also propose that the He-dominated atmosphere
of GD 362 is likely to be the result of the merger of a binary white dwarf.
"
What is the first direct and time-resolved observation of correlated tunnelling of two interacting atoms through a barrier in a double well potential?,"  Tunnelling of material particles through a classically impenetrable barrier
constitutes one of the hallmark effects of quantum physics. When interactions
between the particles compete with their mobility through a tunnel junction,
intriguing novel dynamical behaviour can arise where particles do not tunnel
independently. In single-electron or Bloch transistors, for example, the
tunnelling of an electron or Cooper pair can be enabled or suppressed by the
presence of a second charge carrier due to Coulomb blockade. Here we report on
the first direct and time-resolved observation of correlated tunnelling of two
interacting atoms through a barrier in a double well potential. We show that
for weak interactions between the atoms and dominating tunnel coupling,
individual atoms can tunnel independently, similar to the case in a normal
Josephson junction. With strong repulsive interactions present, two atoms
located on one side of the barrier cannot separate, but are observed to tunnel
together as a pair in a second order co-tunnelling process. By recording both
the atom position and phase coherence over time, we fully characterize the
tunnelling process for a single atom as well as the correlated dynamics of a
pair of atoms for weak and strong interactions. In addition, we identify a
conditional tunnelling regime, where a single atom can only tunnel in the
presence of a second particle, acting as a single atom switch. Our work
constitutes the first direct observation of second order tunnelling events with
ultracold atoms, which are the dominating dynamical effect in the strongly
interacting regime. Similar second-order processes form the basis of
superexchange interactions between atoms on neighbouring lattice sites of a
periodic potential, a central component of quantum magnetism.
"
How do the results of quantum transport calculations in open quantum dots compare with experimental observations at ultralow temperatures?,"  We perform self-consistent quantum transport calculations in open quantum
dots taking into account the effect of electron interaction. We demonstrative
that in the regime of the ultralow temperatures $2\pi k_BT\lesssim\Delta$
($\Delta $ being the mean level spacing), the electron interaction strongly
affects the conductance oscillations and their statistics leading to a drastic
deviation from the corresponding predictions for noninteracting electrons. In
particular, it causes smearing of conductance oscillations, which is similar to
the effect of temperature or inelastic scattering. For $2\pi k_BT\gtrsim\Delta$
the influence of electron interaction on the conductance becomes strongly
diminished. Our calculations (that are free from phenomenological parameters of
the theory) are in good quantitative agreement with the observed ultralow
temperature statistics (Huibers \textit{et al.}, Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{81},
1917 (1998)). Our findings question a conventional interpretation of the
ultralow temperature saturation of the coherence time in open dots which is
based on the noninteracting theories where the electron interaction is
neglected and the agrement with the experiment is achieved by introducing
additional phenomenological channels of dephasing.
"
What is the relationship between the LBV and Wolf-Rayet evolution and the circumstellar absorption components in the spectra of GRB 021004?,"  Van Marle et al. (2005) showed that circumstellar absorption lines in early
Type Ib/c supernova and gamma-ray burst afterglow spectra may reveal the
progenitor evolution of the exploding Wolf-Rayet star. While the quoted paper
deals with Wolf-Rayet stars which evolved through a red supergiant stage, we
investigate here the initially more massive Wolf-Rayet stars which are thought
to evolve through a Luminous Blue Variable (LBV) stage. We perform hydrodynamic
simulations of the evolution of the circumstellar medium around a 60 Msol star,
from the main sequence through the LBV and Wolf-Rayet stages, up to core
collapse. We then compute the column density of the circumstellar matter as a
function of radial velocity, time and angle. This allows a comparison with the
number and blue-shifts, of absorption components in the spectra of LBVs,
Wolf-Rayet stars, Type Ib/c supernovae and gamma-ray burst afterglows. Our
simulation for the post-LBV stage shows the formation of various absorption
components, which are, however, rather short lived; they dissipate on time
scales shorter than 50,000yr. As the LBV stage is thought to occur at the
beginning of core helium burning, the remaining Wolf-Rayet life time is
expected to be one order of magnitude larger. When interpreting the absorption
components in the afterglow spectrum of GRB-021004 as circumstellar, it can be
concluded that the progenitor of this source did most likely not evolve through
an LBV stage. However, a close binary with late common-envelope phase (Case C)
may produce a circumstellar medium that closely resembles the LBV to Wolf-Rayet
evolution, but with a much shorter Wolf-Rayet period.
"
What is the relationship between the Sersic profile and the NFW profile for strong lensing?,"  We investigate the strong lensing properties of the Sersic profile as an
alternative to the NFW profile, focusing on applications to lens modelling of
clusters. Given an underlying Sersic dark matter profile, we study whether an
NFW profile can provide an acceptable fit to strong lensing constraints in the
form of single or multiple measured Einstein radii. We conclude that although
an NFW profile that fits the lensing constraints can be found in many cases,
the derived parameters may be biased. In particular, we find that for n~2,
which corresponds to massive clusters, the mass at r_200 of the best fit NFW is
overestimated (by a factor of ~2) and the concentration is very low (c~2). The
differences are important enough to warrant the inclusion of Sersic profile for
future analysis of strong lensing clusters.

Is there a correlation between Li and Na abundances in TO stars of the Globular Cluster 47 Tuc?,"  aims: Our aim is to determine Li abundances in TO stars of the Globular
Cluster 47 Tuc and test theories about Li variations among TO stars. method: We
make use of high resolution (R~ 43000), high signal-to-noise ratio (S/N=50--70)
spectra of 4 turn off (TO) stars obtained with the UVES spectrograph at the
8.2m VLT Kueyen telescope. results: The four stars observed, span the range
1.6<~A(Li)} <~ 2.14, providing a mean A(Li) = 1.84 with a standard deviation of
0.25 dex. When coupled with data of other two TO stars of the cluster,
available in the literature, the full range in Li abundances observed in this
cluster is 1.6<~A(Li)<~ 2.3. The variation in A(Li) is at least 0.6 dex (0.7
dex considering also the data available in the literature) and the scatter is
six times larger than what expected from the observational error. We claim that
these variations are real. A(Li) seems to be anti-correlated with A(Na) exactly
as observed in NGC 6752. No systematic error in our analysis could produce such
an anti-correlation. conclusions: Na production through p captures on 22Ne at
temperatures in excess of 3x10^7 K and the contemporary Li destruction could
result in this anti-correlation. However such nuclear processing cannot have
taken place in the stars themselves, which do not reach such high temperatures,
even at their centre. This points towards the processing in a previous
generation of stars. The low N/O ratios in the observed stars and the apparent
lack of correlation between N an Li abundances, place a strong constraint on
the properties of this previous generation. Our results indicate a different
behaviour among the Globular Clusters so far studied as far as the abundance
patterns are concerned.
"
What are the advantages of using the braid structure to find information about a fibered knot in the branched double cover?,"  A companion paper to ""On knot Floer homology in branched double covers""
applied to braided branched loci. We reprove the main result of that paper
concerning alternating branched loci when projected to an annulus, without
using Khovanov homology. This provides two advantages: 1) the results hold for
integer coefficients and 2) the spin^c structures are more readily discernable.
We apply this result to a branch locus which is a braid, and use the braid
structure to find information about a fibered knot in the branched double
cover. In some cases this provides all the information about the knot Floer
homology and can be used to derive information about the Heegaard-Floer
homology of associated fibered three manifolds. Results for certain positive
braids are also included, establishing results similar to E. Eftekhary's in the
Heegaard-Floer setting.

"What is the Langevin simulation used to simulate the propagation of quarks, gluons, and other particles in a Quark-Gluon Plasma?","  We present predictions for the nuclear modification factor and elliptic flow
of D and B mesons, as well as of their decay electrons, in semicentral Pb-Pb
collisions at the LHC. Heavy quarks are propagated in a Quark-Gluon Plasma
using a relativistic Langevin simulation with drag and diffusion coefficients
from elastic interactions with light anti-/quarks and gluons, including
non-perturbative resonance scattering. Hadronization at T_c is performed within
a combined coalescence-fragmentation scheme.
"
What are the properties of nanoparticles formed by wire electrical explosion?,"  Structure and properties of nanoparticles formed under conditions of wire
electrical explosion were studied. It was shown that the state of WEE power
particles can be characterized as a metastable state. It leads to an increased
stability of nanopowders at normal temperatures and an increased reactivity
during heating, which is revealed in the form of threshold phenomena.
"
What are the qualitative features in the KKLT scenario that are preserved in the generalized F-term uplifting scenarios?,"  We study moduli stabilization and a realization of de Sitter vacua in
generalized F-term uplifting scenarios of the KKLT-type anti-de Sitter vacuum,
where the uplifting sector X directly couples to the light K\""ahler modulus T
in the superpotential through, e.g., stringy instanton effects. F-term
uplifting can be achieved by a spontaneous supersymmetry breaking sector, e.g.,
the Polonyi model, the O'Raifeartaigh model and the Intriligator-Seiberg-Shih
model. Several models with the X-T mixing are examined and qualitative features
in most models {\it even with such mixing} are almost the same as those in the
KKLT scenario. One of the quantitative changes, which are relevant to the
phenomenology, is a larger hierarchy between the modulus mass m_T and the
gravitino mass $m_{3/2}$, i.e., $m_T/m_{3/2} = {\cal O}(a^2)$, where $a \sim 4
\pi^2$. In spite of such a large mass, the modulus F-term is suppressed not
like $F^T = {\cal O}(m_{3/2}/a^2)$, but like $F^T = {\cal O}(m_{3/2}/a)$ for
$\ln (M_{Pl}/m_{3/2}) \sim a$, because of an enhancement factor coming from the
X-T mixing. Then we typically find a mirage-mediation pattern of gaugino masses
of ${\cal O}(m_{3/2}/a)$, while the scalar masses would be generically of
${\cal O}(m_{3/2})$.
"
What is the relationship between the closed field lines in neutron stars and the production of radio and high energy emission?,"  A number of disparate observational and theoretical pieces of evidence
indicate that, contrary to the conventional wisdom, neutron stars' closed field
lines are populated by dense, hot plasma and may be responsible for producing
some radio and high energy emission. This conclusion is based on eclipse
modeling of the binary pulsar system PSR J0737-3039A/B (Lyutikov & Thompson
2005), a quantitative theory of Crab giant pulses (Lyutikov 2007) and a number
of theoretical works related to production of non-thermal spectra in magnetars
through resonant scattering. In magnetars, dense pair plasma is produced by
twisting magnetic field lines and associated electric fields required to lift
the particles from the surface. In long period pulsars, hot particles on closed
field lines can be efficiently trapped by magnetic mirroring, so that
relatively low supply rate, e.g. due to a drift from open field lines, may
result in high density. In short period pulsars, magnetic mirroring does not
work; large densities may still be expected at the magnetic equator near the
Y-point.
"
What is the number of fixed points on the set of involutions in complex reflection groups?,"  Recently, Bagno, Garber and Mansour studied a kind of excedance number on the
complex reflection groups and computed its multidistribution with the number of
fixed points on the set of involutions in these groups. In this note, we
consider the similar problems in more general cases and make a correction of
one result obtained by them.
"
What are the differences between the relativistic and non-relativistic versions of the multiple scattering theory?,"  It is shown that a relativistic multiple scattering theory for hadron-nucleus
scattering can be consistently formulated in four-dimensions in the context of
meson exchange. We give a multiple scattering series for the optical potential
and discuss the differences between the relativistic and non-relativistic
versions. We develop the relativistic multiple scattering series by separating
out the one boson exchange term from the rest of the Feynman series. However
this particular separation is not absolutely necessary and we discuss how to
include other terms. We then show how to make a three-dimensional reduction for
hadron-nucleus scattering calculations and we find that the relative energy
prescription used in the elastic scattering equation should be consistent with
the one used in the free two-body t-matrix involved in the optical potential.
We also discuss what assumptions are involved in making a Dirac Relativistic
Impulse Approximation (RIA).
"
What is the comparison of the measured dijet cross sections with theoretical predictions in the context of QCD calculations?,"  The production of dijets in diffractive deep inelastic scattering has been
measured with the ZEUS detector at HERA using an integrated luminosity of $61
\pbi$. The dijet cross section has been measured for virtualities of the
exchanged virtual photon, $5 < Q^2 < 100 \gev^2$, and $\gamma^{*} p$
centre-of-mass energies, 100 < W < 250 GeV. The jets, identified using the
inclusive k_{T} algorithm in the $\gamma^* p$ frame, were required to have a
transverse energy $E^*_{T, \rm jet} > 4 \gev$ and the jet with the highest
transverse energy was required to have $E^*_{T,\rm jet} > 5 \gev$. All jets
were required to be in the pseudorapidity range $-3.5 < \eta^*_{\rm jet} < 0$.
The differential cross sections are compared to leading-order predictions and
next-to-leading-order QCD calculations based on recent diffractive parton
densities extracted from inclusive diffractive deep inelastic scattering data.
"
How does the concentration of metal in the growth medium affect the concentration of metal absorbed by the plant?,"  This work is a study of the inter-relationship between parameters that
principally affect metal up-take in the plant. The relationships between the
concentration of metal in the growth medium, Cs, the concentration of metal
absorbed by the plant, Cp, and the total biomass achieved, M, all of which are
factors relevant to the efficiency of phytoremediation of the plant, have been
investigated via the macro-physiological response of Brassica juncea seedlings
to Ni(II) stress. The factorial growth experiments treated the Ni(II)
concentration in the agar gel and the diurnal light quanta (DLQ) as
independently variable parameters. Observations included the evidence of light
enhancement of Ni toxicity at the root as well as at the whole plant level, the
shoot mass index as a possible indicator of shoot metal sequestration in B.
juncea, the logarithmic variation of Cp with Cs and the power-law dependence of
M on Cp. The sum total of these observations indicate that for the metal
accumulator B. juncea with regard to its capacity to accumulate Ni, the overall
metabolic nature of the plant is important; neither rapid biomass increase nor
a high metal concentration capability favor the removal of high metal mass from
the medium, but rather the plant with the moderate photosynthetically driven
biomass growth and moderate metal concentrations demonstrated the ability to
remove the maximum mass of metal from the medium. The implications of these
observations in the context of the perceived need in phytoremediation
engineering to maximize Cp and M simultaneously in the same plant, are
discussed.
"
What are the implications of the uniform kappa-noncollapsing estimate for the Ricci flow with surgeries?,"  We derive a logarithmic Sobolev inequality along the Ricci flow without any
restriction on time, which depends only on the initial metric via rudimentary
geometric data, assuming only that a certain first eigenvalue is positive. As a
consequence we obtain a uniform Sobolev inequality along the Ricci flow without
any restriction on time. One application of it is a uniform kappa-noncollapsing
estimate which holds true for all time. We also obtain similar results for
bounded time without assuming the eigenvalue condition. The results extend to
the Ricci flow with surgeries.
"
"What are the sound, precise bounds for fixed-point or floating-point implementations of the filters?","  Digital linear filters are used in a variety of applications (sound
treatment, control/command, etc.), implemented in software, in hardware, or a
combination thereof. For safety-critical applications, it is necessary to bound
all variables and outputs of all filters. We give a compositional, effective
abstraction for digital linear filters expressed as block diagrams, yielding
sound, precise bounds for fixed-point or floating-point implementations of the
filters.
"
What is the dependence of the chlorine concentration [Cl+Te] on the temperature of annealing in the high-temperature stage?,"  The process of annealing of a CdTe:Cl ingot during its cooling after growth
was studied. The annealing was performed in two stages: a high-temperature
stage, with an approximate equality of chlorine and cadmium vacancy
concentrations established at the thermodynamic equilibrium between the crystal
and vapors of volatile components, and a low-temperature stage, with charged
defects interacting to form neutral associations. The chlorine concentrations
necessary to obtain semi-insulating crystals were determined for various ingot
cooling rates in the high temperature stage. The dependence of the chlorine
concentration [Cl+Te] in the ingot on the temperature of annealing in the
high-temperature stage was found. The carrier lifetimes and drift mobilities
were obtained in relation to the temperature and cadmium vapor pressure in the
postgrowth annealing of the ingot.
"
What is the method of the proof of the Riemann hypothesis derived in $M_{A}$?,"  A short proof of the generalized Riemann hypothesis (gRH in short) for zeta
functions $\zeta_{k}$ of algebraic number fields $k$ - based on the Hecke's
proof of the functional equation for $\zeta_{k}$ and the method of the proof of
the Riemann hypothesis derived in [$M_{A}$] (algebraic proof of the Riemann
hypothesis) is given. The generalized Riemann hypothesis for Dirichlet
L-functions is an immediately consequence of (gRH) for $\zeta_{k}$ and suitable
product formula which connects the Dedekind zetas with L-functions.
"
What is the magnetic field produced by a thin current-carrying wire with small geometric modulations along the edge?,"  Surface based geometries of microfabricated wires or patterned magnetic films
can be used to magnetically trap and manipulate ultracold neutral atoms or
Bose-Einstein condensates. We investigate the magnetic properties of such atom
chips using a scanning magnetoresistive (MR) microscope with high spatial
resolution and high field sensitivity. We show that MR sensors are ideally
suited to observe small variations of the magnetic field caused by
imperfections in the wires or magnetic materials which ultimately lead to
fragmentation of ultracold atom clouds. Measurements are also provided for the
magnetic field produced by a thin current-carrying wire with small geometric
modulations along the edge. Comparisons of our measurements with a full numeric
calculation of the current flow in the wire and the subsequent magnetic field
show excellent agreement. Our results highlight the use of scanning MR
microscopy as a convenient and powerful technique for precisely characterizing
the magnetic fields produced near the surface of atom chips.
"
How do Incremental Quantile (IQ) estimation methods address the challenges of networked applications?,"  Networked applications have software components that reside on different
computers. Email, for example, has database, processing, and user interface
components that can be distributed across a network and shared by users in
different locations or work groups. End-to-end performance and reliability
metrics describe the software quality experienced by these groups of users,
taking into account all the software components in the pipeline. Each user
produces only some of the data needed to understand the quality of the
application for the group, so group performance metrics are obtained by
combining summary statistics that each end computer periodically (and
automatically) sends to a central server. The group quality metrics usually
focus on medians and tail quantiles rather than on averages. Distributed
quantile estimation is challenging, though, especially when passing large
amounts of data around the network solely to compute quality metrics is
undesirable. This paper describes an Incremental Quantile (IQ) estimation
method that is designed for performance monitoring at arbitrary levels of
network aggregation and time resolution when only a limited amount of data can
be transferred. Applications to both real and simulated data are provided.
"
What is the branching fraction for the decay $K^{-} \to \pi^{0} e \bar \nu$ measured with the {\bf ISTRA+} setup?,"  The branching fraction for the decay $K^{-} \to \pi^{0} e \bar \nu$ is
measured using in-flight decays detected with {\bf ISTRA+} setup working at the
25 GeV negative secondary beam of the U-70 PS:\linebreak $Br_{K_{e3}}= (5.124
\pm 0.009 (stat) \pm 0.029(norm) \pm 0.030(syst))%$. From this value the
$|V_{us}|$ element of the CKM matrix is extracted, using previously measured
$f_{+}(t)$ form factor: $|V_{us}|=0.227 \pm 0.002$. The results are in
agreement with recent measurements by BNL E865, FNAL KTeV, KLOE.
"
What is the Wigner function of the evolving state in a chaotic system?,"  We analyze the semiclassical evolution of Gaussian wavepackets in chaotic
systems. We prove that after some short time a Gaussian wavepacket becomes a
primitive WKB state. From then on, the state can be propagated using the
standard TDWKB scheme. Complex trajectories are not necessary to account for
the long-time propagation. The Wigner function of the evolving state develops
the structure of a classical filament plus quantum oscillations, with phase and
amplitude being determined by geometric properties of a classical manifold.
"
What is the relationship between the Riemannian manifold and the Bakry-Emery Ricci tensor?,"  For Riemannian manifolds with a measure $(M,g, e^{-f} dvol_g)$ we prove mean
curvature and volume comparison results when the $\infty$-Bakry-Emery Ricci
tensor is bounded from below and $f$ is bounded or $\partial_r f$ is bounded
from below, generalizing the classical ones (i.e. when $f$ is constant). This
leads to extensions of many theorems for Ricci curvature bounded below to the
Bakry-Emery Ricci tensor. In particular, we give extensions of all of the major
comparison theorems when $f$ is bounded. Simple examples show the bound on $f$
is necessary for these results.
"
What is the dual of the Pauli graph in a qubit-qutrit system?,"  The commutation relations of the generalized Pauli operators of a
qubit-qutrit system are discussed in the newly established graph-theoretic and
finite-geometrical settings. The dual of the Pauli graph of this system is
found to be isomorphic to the projective line over the product ring Z2xZ3. A
""peculiar"" feature in comparison with two-qubits is that two distinct
points/operators can be joined by more than one line. The multi-line property
is shown to be also present in the graphs/geometries characterizing two-qutrit
and three-qubit Pauli operators' space and surmised to be exhibited by any
other higher-level quantum system.
"
What is the value of Krein's spectral shift function inside essential spectral gaps?,"  We extend relative oscillation theory to the case of Sturm--Liouville
operators $H u = r^{-1}(-(pu')'+q u)$ with different $p$'s. We show that the
weighted number of zeros of Wronskians of certain solutions equals the value of
Krein's spectral shift function inside essential spectral gaps.
"
What is the Borel hierarchy on the reals having a length ω2?,"  We show that it is relatively consistent with ZF that the Borel hierarchy on
the reals has length $\omega_2$. This implies that $\omega_1$ has countable
cofinality, so the axiom of choice fails very badly in our model. A similar
argument produces models of ZF in which the Borel hierarchy has length any
given limit ordinal less than $\omega_2$, e.g., $\omega$ or
$\omega_1+\omega_1$.

"
What is the relationship between the number of bound states and the number of normalizable bound states?,"  The low energy spectrum of (3+1)-dimensional N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills
theory on a spatial three-torus contains a certain number of bound states,
characterized by their discrete abelian magnetic and electric 't Hooft fluxes.
At weak coupling, the wave-functions of these states are supported near points
in the moduli space of flat connections where the unbroken gauge group is
semi-simple. The number of such states is related to the number of normalizable
bound states at threshold in the supersymmetric matrix quantum mechanics with
16 supercharges based on this unbroken group. Mathematically, the determination
of the spectrum relies on the classification of almost commuting triples with
semi-simple centralizers. We complete the work begun in a previous paper, by
computing the spectrum of bound states in theories based on the
even-dimensional spin groups and the exceptional groups. The results satisfy
the constraints of S-duality in a rather non-trivial way.
"
What is the relationship between field/intensity correlations and the channel and spatial correlations in wave transport through a volume-disordered waveguide?,"  We study analytically and numerically field/intensity correlations in wave
transport through volume-disordered waveguide. The obtained channel and spacial
correlations deviate from those found in framework of
Dorokhov-Mello-Pereyra-Kumar (DMPK) formalism, that we relate to
inapplicability of equivalent channel approximation in DMPK. We show that this
can be remedied by introducing boundary correction -- an escape function which
depends on the waveguide geometry -- that describes wave transport near a
boundary between random medium and free space. We obtain the expressions for
field/intensity channel and spacial correlation functions which agree with the
numerics and are consistent with the perturbative expressions in slab geometry
as well as experiments conducted in Q1D.
"
What is the optical technique used to load ion traps in microtrap architectures?,"  An experimental demonstration of a novel all-optical technique for loading
ion traps, that has particular application to microtrap architectures, is
presented. The technique is based on photo-ionisation of an atomic beam created
by pulsed laser ablation of a calcium target, and provides improved temporal
control compared to traditional trap loading methods. Ion loading rates as high
as 125 ions per second have so far been observed. Also described are
observations of trap loading where Rydberg state atoms are photo-ionised by the
ion Doppler cooling laser.
"
What is the implication of the orientation of the observer on the isophotal shape of a galaxy?,"  We investigate isophotal properties and dust morphology in the nuclear
regions of 84 radio galaxies, imaged in the optical and near-infrared as part
of Hubble Space Telescope snapshot surveys. We present a sample-wide trend
between host galaxy isophotal structure and the inclination of dusty
circumnuclear disks at the centers of 13 of these objects. We find that
galaxies containing edge-on disks are invariably seen to possess boxy
isophotes, while round, face-on disks are seen exclusively in objects with
round or elliptical isophotes. Dust-rich sources with disky isophotes are
observed only to possess dust in the form of extended filamentary lanes, and
not in settled distributions like disks. As we do not expect that edge-on and
face-on disks reside in different populations of galaxies, we conclude that
perceived isophotal boxiness is dependent upon the angle at which the observer
views the host galaxy's axis of symmetry. We discuss our results in the context
of dissipative merger scenarios, and infer that dusty disks primarily reside in
old, boxy remnants of gas-poor galaxy mergers, whereas filamentary dust lanes
reside in younger disky remnants of gas-rich mergers.
"
How to construct upper bounds for the labelling number of other event structures of degree 3?,"  We address the problem of &#64257;nding nice labellings for event structures
of degree 3. We develop a minimum theory by which we prove that the labelling
number of an event structure of degree 3 is bounded by a linear function of the
height. The main theorem we present in this paper states that event structures
of degree 3 whose causality order is a tree have a nice labelling with 3
colors. Finally, we exemplify how to use this theorem to construct upper bounds
for the labelling number of other event structures of degree 3.
"
What are the knot's ends found to jump to well-defined locations?,"  We perform theoretical studies of stretching of 20 proteins with knots within
a coarse grained model. The knot's ends are found to jump to well defined
sequential locations that are associated with sharp turns whereas in
homopolymers they diffuse around and eventually slide off. The waiting times of
the jumps are increasingly stochastic as the temperature is raised. Larger
knots do not return to their native locations when a protein is released after
stretching.
"
What are the details of the proof of the Poincaré recurrence in a 2D Euler equation of inviscid incompressible fluids?,"  Nadirashvili presented a beautiful example showing that the Poincar\'e
recurrence does not occur near a particular solution to the 2D Euler equation
of inviscid incompressible fluids. Unfortunately, Nadirashvili's setup of the
phase space is not appropriate, and details of the proof are missing. This note
fixes that.
"
What are the effects of bistable coherent impurities in solid state qubits?,"  We propose a characterisation of the effects of bistable coherent impurities
in solid state qubits. We introduce an effective impurity description in terms
of a tunable spin-boson environment and solve the dynamics for the qubit
coherences. The dominant rate characterizing the asymptotic time limit is
identified and signatures of non-Gaussian behavior of the quantum impurity at
intermediate times are pointed out. An alternative perspective considering the
qubit as a measurement device for the spin-boson impurity is proposed.
"
What are the eigenfunctions of the Lyapunov function in the context of a Riemann surface?,"  We consider the Schr\""odinger operator with a periodic potential on quasi-1D
models of armchair single-wall nanotubes. The spectrum of this operator
consists of an absolutely continuous part (intervals separated by gaps) plus an
infinite number of eigenvalues with infinite multiplicity. We describe all
eigenfunctions with the same eigenvalue. We define a Lyapunov function, which
is analytic on some Riemann surface. On each sheet, the Lyapunov function has
the same properties as in the scalar case, but it has branch points, which we
call resonances. In example we show the existence of real and complex
resonances for some specific potentials.
"
What are the characters of many supercuspidal representations of reductive p-adic groups?,"  We compute the characters of many supercuspidal representations of reductive
p-adic groups. Specifically, we deal with representations that arise via Yu's
construction from data satisfying a certain compactness condition. Each
character is expressed in terms of a depth-zero character of a smaller group,
the (linear) characters appearing in Yu's construction, Fourier transforms of
orbital integrals, and certain signs and cardinalities that are described
explicitly in terms of the datum associated to the representation and of the
element at which the character is evaluated.
"
What is the evidence for the presence of an infrared excess in the optical spectrum?,"  We present new optical spectroscopic and archival Spitzer IRAC photometric
observations of a B-type star in the SMC cluster NGC 346, NGC 346:KWBBe 200. We
detect numerous Fe II, [O I], and [Fe II] lines, as well as strong P-Cygni
profile H I emission lines in its optical spectrum. The star's near-IR color
and optical to IR SED clearly indicate the presence of an infrared excess,
consistent with the presence of gas and warm, T ~800 K, circumstellar dust.
Based on a crude estimate of the star's luminosity and the observed
spectroscopic line profile morphologies, we find that the star is likely to be
a B-type supergiant. We suggest that NGC 346:KWBBe 200 is a newly discovered
B[e] supergiant star, and represents the fifth such object to be identified in
the SMC.
"
What is the relativistic flux tube model used to compute the mass spectra of heavy and light mesons?,"  The mass spectra of heavy and light mesons is computed within the framework
of the relativistic flux tube model. A good agreement with the experimental
data is obtained provided that the flux tube contributions, including
retardation and spin-orbit effects, are supplemented by a one-gluon-exchange
potential, a quark self-energy term and instanton-induced interactions. No
arbitrary constant is needed to fit the absolute scale of the mass spectra, and
the different parameters are fitted on lattice QCD in order to strongly
restrict the arbitrariness of our model. The relevance of the present approach
is discussed in the case of glueballs, and the glueball spectrum we compute is
compared to the lattice QCD one. Finally, we make connections between the
results of our model and the nature of some newly discovered experimental
states such as the f_0(1810), X(3940), Y(3940), etc.
"
What are the marginal distributions of a stationary AR(1) process?,"  In this note we correct an omission in our paper (Satheesh and Sandhya, 2005)
in defining semi-selfdecomposable laws and also show with examples that the
marginal distributions of a stationary AR(1) process need not even be
infinitely divisible.
"
"What are the symmetries of B\""or\""oczky tilings in hyperbolic space in arbitrary dimension?","  We consider families of B\""or\""oczky tilings in hyperbolic space in arbitrary
dimension, study some basic properties and classify all possible symmetries. In
particular, it is shown that these tilings are non-crystallographic, and that
there are uncountably many tilings with a fixed prototile.
"
What are the expressions for the density matrix in terms of correlators given by the Chung-Peschel formula?,"  The trace of integer powers of the local density matrix corresponding to the
vacuum state reduced to a region V can be formally expressed in terms of a
functional integral on a manifold with conical singularities. Recently, some
progress has been made in explicitly evaluating this type of integrals for free
fields. However, finding the associated geometric entropy remained in general a
difficult task involving an analytic continuation in the conical angle. In this
paper, we obtain this analytic continuation explicitly exploiting a relation
between the functional integral formulas and the Chung-Peschel expressions for
the density matrix in terms of correlators. The result is that the entropy is
given in terms of a functional integral in flat Euclidean space with a cut on V
where a specific boundary condition is imposed. As an example we get the exact
entanglement entropies for massive scalar and Dirac free fields in 1+1
dimensions in terms of the solutions of a non linear differential equation of
the Painleve V type.
"
What is the concept of the superpotential in every mirror fiber?,"  We use representation theory to construct integral formulas for solutions to
the quantum Toda lattice in general type. This result generalizes work of
Givental for SL(n)/B in a uniform way to arbitrary type and can be interpreted
as a kind of mirror theorem for the full flag variety G/B. We also prove the
existence of a totally positive critical point of the 'superpotential' in every
mirror fiber.
"
What is the impact of the Pi phase shift using a translating mirror on the nulling ratio in the nulling experiment?,"  Aims: In the context of space interferometry missions devoted to the search
of exo-Earths, this paper investigates the capabilities of new single mode
conductive waveguides at providing modal filtering in an infrared and
monochromatic nulling experiment; Methods: A Michelson laser interferometer
with a co-axial beam combination scheme at 10.6 microns is used. After
introducing a Pi phase shift using a translating mirror, dynamic and static
measurements of the nulling ratio are performed in the two cases where modal
filtering is implemented and suppressed. No additional active control of the
wavefront errors is involved. Results: We achieve on average a statistical
nulling ratio of 2.5e-4 with a 1-sigma upper limit of 6e-4, while a best null
of 5.6e-5 is obtained in static mode. At the moment, the impact of external
vibrations limits our ability to maintain the null to 10 to 20 seconds.;
Conclusions: A positive effect of SM conductive waveguide on modal filtering
has been observed in this study. Further improvement of the null should be
possible with proper mechanical isolation of the setup.
"
What is the angular dependence of the signals generated by high-energy electrons and muons in lead tungstate crystals?,"  Results are presented of detailed measurements of the signals generated by
high-energy electrons and muons in lead tungstate crystals. A significant
fraction of the light produced in these crystals and detected by
photomultiplier tubes is the result of the \v{C}erenkov mechanism. This is
concluded from the angular dependence of the signals and from their time
structure. Depending on the orientation of the crystals and on the particle
type, \v{C}erenkov light may account for up to 15% of the total signals.
"
What is the effect of unitary noise mechanisms on the evolution of a quantum walk on a linear chain with a generic coin operation?,"  We consider the effect of different unitary noise mechanisms on the evolution
of a quantum walk (QW) on a linear chain with a generic coin operation: (i)
bit-flip channel noise, restricted to the coin subspace of the QW, and (ii)
topological noise caused by randomly broken links in the linear chain.
Similarities and differences in the respective decoherent dynamics of the
walker as a function of the probability per unit time of a decoherent event
taking place are discussed.
"
What is the relationship between the Kahler phases in nonabelian gauged linear sigma models?,"  In this paper we outline some aspects of nonabelian gauged linear sigma
models. First, we review how partial flag manifolds (generalizing
Grassmannians) are described physically by nonabelian gauged linear sigma
models, paying attention to realizations of tangent bundles and other aspects
pertinent to (0,2) models. Second, we review constructions of Calabi-Yau
complete intersections within such flag manifolds, and properties of the gauged
linear sigma models. We discuss a number of examples of nonabelian GLSM's in
which the Kahler phases are not birational, and in which at least one phase is
realized in some fashion other than as a complete intersection, extending
previous work of Hori-Tong. We also review an example of an abelian GLSM
exhibiting the same phenomenon. We tentatively identify the mathematical
relationship between such non-birational phases, as examples of Kuznetsov's
homological projective duality. Finally, we discuss linear sigma model moduli
spaces in these gauged linear sigma models. We argue that the moduli spaces
being realized physically by these GLSM's are precisely Quot and hyperquot
schemes, as one would expect mathematically.

What is the difference between the Newton-type nonlinear solver and the iterative solver based on freezing the nonlinearity?,"  The nonlinear Helmholtz equation (NLH) models the propagation of
electromagnetic waves in Kerr media, and describes a range of important
phenomena in nonlinear optics and in other areas. In our previous work, we
developed a fourth order method for its numerical solution that involved an
iterative solver based on freezing the nonlinearity. The method enabled a
direct simulation of nonlinear self-focusing in the nonparaxial regime, and a
quantitative prediction of backscattering. However, our simulations showed that
there is a threshold value for the magnitude of the nonlinearity, above which
the iterations diverge. In this study, we numerically solve the one-dimensional
NLH using a Newton-type nonlinear solver. Because the Kerr nonlinearity
contains absolute values of the field, the NLH has to be recast as a system of
two real equations in order to apply Newton's method. Our numerical simulations
show that Newton's method converges rapidly and, in contradistinction with the
iterations based on freezing the nonlinearity, enables computations for very
high levels of nonlinearity. In addition, we introduce a novel compact
finite-volume fourth order discretization for the NLH with material
discontinuities.The one-dimensional results of the current paper create a
foundation for the analysis of multi-dimensional problems in the future.

"What are the two strategies, namely ""lazy"" and ""eager"", used in linear tabling, and how do they differ from each other?","  Recently, the iterative approach named linear tabling has received
considerable attention because of its simplicity, ease of implementation, and
good space efficiency. Linear tabling is a framework from which different
methods can be derived based on the strategies used in handling looping
subgoals. One decision concerns when answers are consumed and returned. This
paper describes two strategies, namely, {\it lazy} and {\it eager} strategies,
and compares them both qualitatively and quantitatively. The results indicate
that, while the lazy strategy has good locality and is well suited for finding
all solutions, the eager strategy is comparable in speed with the lazy strategy
and is well suited for programs with cuts. Linear tabling relies on depth-first
iterative deepening rather than suspension to compute fixpoints. Each cluster
of inter-dependent subgoals as represented by a top-most looping subgoal is
iteratively evaluated until no subgoal in it can produce any new answers. Naive
re-evaluation of all looping subgoals, albeit simple, may be computationally
unacceptable. In this paper, we also introduce semi-naive optimization, an
effective technique employed in bottom-up evaluation of logic programs to avoid
redundant joins of answers, into linear tabling. We give the conditions for the
technique to be safe (i.e. sound and complete) and propose an optimization
technique called {\it early answer promotion} to enhance its effectiveness.
Benchmarking in B-Prolog demonstrates that with this optimization linear
tabling compares favorably well in speed with the state-of-the-art
implementation of SLG.

How can quantum computation be performed using three qubits?,"  We show how to control and perform universal three-qubit quantum computation
with trapped electron quantum states. The three qubits are the electron spin,
and the first two quantum states of the cyclotron and axial harmonic
oscillators. We explicitly show how the universal gates can be performed. As an
example of a non-trivial quantum algorithm, we outline the implementation of
the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm in this system.

"What are the interactions that give rise to the molecular symmetries Δ, Π, and Σ?","  A general formalism is used to express the long-range potential energies in
inverse powers of the separation distance between two like atomic or molecular
systems with $P$ symmetries. The long-range molecular interaction coefficients
are calculated for the molecular symmetries $\Delta$, $\Pi$, and $\Sigma$,
arising from the following interactions: He($2 ^1P$)--He($2 ^1P$), He($2
^1P$)--He($2 ^3P$), and He($2 ^3P$)--He($2 ^3P$). The electric
quadrupole-quadrupole term, $C_{5}$, the van der Waals (dispersion) term
$C_{6}$, and higher-order terms, $C_{8}$, and $C_{10}$, are calculated
\textit{ab initio} using accurate variational wave functions in Hylleraas
coordinates with finite nuclear mass effects. A comparison is made with
previously published results where available.
"
What are the results of the OXBASH code calculations for the low-lying energy states of neutron-rich oxygen isotopes?,"  Shell model calculations for low lying energy states of neutron rich oxygen
isotopes 19O, 20O, 21O, 22O, 23O, 24O, 25O, 26O have been performed using
OXBASH code. The configuration space consists of 0d5/2, 1s1/2, 0d3/2 orbital
for neutrons outside the 16O core. Different interactions namely, Wildenthal,
Preedom-Wildenthal, Wildenthal-Mcgrory and renormalized Kuo and Brown, which
are either empirical or realistic in nature have been used in the calculation,
The calculated energy spectrum are in good agreement with the experimental data
wherever available for the empirical interactions and the correct ordering of
levels is reproduced. The levels obtained from realistic interactions, though
have a small rms deviation, do not reproduce the correct ordering in some of
the cases. In the case of 21O, realistic interactions predict a much too
compressed 1/2+ state at energy 0.157 MeV compared to the experimental value of
1.218 MeV. For even isotopes the variation of the energy of the first 2+exited
state has been studied as a function of neutron number N. A sharp rise in the
value is observed at N=16 for both empirical and realistic interactions and
only at N=14 for empirical interactions. Significantly higher energy of first
2+ exited state compared to the value in the neighboring even-even nuclei is
considered as a signature for magic nuclei at N=14 and N=16.
"
How is the data partitioning used in the ab initio plane-wave code ABINIT?,"  We suggest and implement a parallelization scheme based on an efficient
multiband eigenvalue solver, called the locally optimal block preconditioned
conjugate gradient LOBPCG method, and using an optimized three-dimensional (3D)
fast Fourier transform (FFT) in the ab initio}plane-wave code ABINIT. In
addition to the standard data partitioning over processors corresponding to
different k-points, we introduce data partitioning with respect to blocks of
bands as well as spatial partitioning in the Fourier space of coefficients over
the plane waves basis set used in ABINIT. This k-points-multiband-FFT
parallelization avoids any collective communications on the whole set of
processors relying instead on one-dimensional communications only. For a single
k-point, super-linear scaling is achieved for up to 100 processors due to an
extensive use of hardware optimized BLAS, LAPACK, and SCALAPACK routines,
mainly in the LOBPCG routine. We observe good performance up to 200 processors.
With 10 k-points our three-way data partitioning results in linear scaling up
to 1000 processors for a practical system used for testing.
"
What is the relationship between the Hausdorff measure of a subset of R^n and the L^2 norm of the Riesz transforms on Lipschitz graphs?,"  Let $E\subset R^d$ with $H^n(E)<\infty$, where H^n stands for the
$n$-dimensional Hausdorff measure. In this paper we prove that E is
n-rectifiable if and only if the limit $$\lim_{\ve\to0}\int_{y\in E:|x-y|>\ve}
\frac{x-y}{|x-y|^{n+1}} dH^n(y)$$ exists H^n-almost everywhere in E. To prove
this result we obtain precise estimates from above and from below for the $L^2$
norm of the n-dimensional Riesz transforms on Lipschitz graphs.
"
Can stellar surface structures be used to detect small exoplanets in the habitable zone of a star?,"  We investigate the astrometric effects of stellar surface structures as a
practical limitation to ultra-high-precision astrometry, e.g. in the context of
exoplanet searches, and to quantify the expected effects in different regions
of the HR-diagram. Stellar surface structures are likely to produce
fluctuations in the integrated flux and radial velocity of the star, as well as
a variation of the observed photocentre, i.e. astrometric jitter, and closure
phase. We use theoretical considerations supported by Monte Carlo simulations
to derive statistical relations between the corresponding astrometric,
photometric, and radial-velocity effects. For most stellar types the
astrometric jitter due to stellar surface structures is expected to be of order
10 micro-AU or greater. This is more than the astrometric displacement
typically caused by an Earth-size exoplanet in the habitable zone, which is
about 1-4 micro-AU for long-lived main-sequence stars. Only for stars with
extremely low photometric variability (<0.5 mmag) and low magnetic activity,
comparable to that of the Sun, will the astrometric jitter be of order 1
micro-AU, suffcient to allow the astrometric detection of an Earth-sized planet
in the habitable zone. While stellar surface structure may thus seriously
impair the astrometric detection of small exoplanets, it has in general
negligible impact on the detection of large (Jupiter-size) planets and on the
determination of stellar parallax and proper motion. From the starspot model we
also conclude that the commonly used spot filling factor is not the most
relevant parameter for quantifying the spottiness in terms of the resulting
astrometric, photometric and radial-velocity variations.

"($\ell=e$, $\mu$) set at the 90% confidence level?","  We present results of a search for the decays $B^0 \to \ell^+\ell^-\gamma$
($\ell=e$, $\mu$). The search is performed using $320\times 10^{6}$ $B\bar{B}$
pairs collected at the $\Upsilon(4S)$ resonance with the BABAR detector at the
PEP-II $B$ Factory at SLAC. We find no significant signal and set the following
branching fraction upper limits at the 90% confidence level:
$\mathcal{B}(B^0\to e^+e^-\gamma)<1.2\times 10^{-7}$ and $\mathcal{B}(B^0\to
\mu^+\mu^-\gamma)<1.5\times 10^{-7}$.
"
What is the dependence of fragmentation cross-section on average binding energy?,"  A remarkably simple dependence of fragmentation cross-section on average
binding energy has been established in experimental data. This dependence was
empirically parametrised leading to a very useful formula for extrapolation. We
find that the canonical thermodynamic model, which has been used in the past
for successful computations of many observables resulting from
multifragmentation, reproduces the salient fetures of fragmentation
cross-sections of very neutron rich nuclei very well. This helps towards a
theoretical understanding of the observed data.
"
What is the flaw in the methodology used by Craig Allan Feinstein to prove P is not equal to NP?,"  We examine a proof by Craig Alan Feinstein that P is not equal to NP. We
present counterexamples to claims made in his paper and expose a flaw in the
methodology he uses to make his assertions. The fault in his argument is the
incorrect use of reduction. Feinstein makes incorrect assumptions about the
complexity of a problem based on the fact that there is a more complex problem
that can be used to solve it. His paper introduces the terminology ""imaginary
processor"" to describe how it is possible to beat the brute force reduction he
offers to solve the Subset-Sum problem. The claims made in the paper would not
be validly established even were imaginary processors to exist.

What are the implications of the metal-poor gas for the formation of stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud?,"  We first show that a large amount of metal-poor gas is stripped from the
Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) and fallen into the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC)
during the tidal interaction between the SMC, the LMC, and the Galaxy over the
last 2 Gyrs. We propose that this metal-poor gas can closely be associated with
the origin of LMC's young and intermediate-age stars and star clusters with
distinctively low-metallicities with [Fe/H] < -0.6. We numerically investigate
whether gas initially in the outer part of the SMC's gas disk can be stripped
during the LMC-SMC-Galaxy interaction and consequently can pass through the
central region (R<7.5 kpc) of the LMC. We find that about 0.7 % and 18 % of the
SMC's gas can pass through the central region of the LMC about 1.3 Gyr ago and
0.2 Gyr ago, respectively. The possible mean metallicity of the replenished gas
from the SMC to LMC is about [Fe/H] = -0.9 to -1.0 for the two interacting
phases. These results imply that the LMC can temporarily replenish gas supplies
through the sporadic accretion and infall of metal-poor gas from the SMC. These
furthermore imply that if these gas from the SMC can collide with gas in the
LMC to form new stars in the LMC, the metallicities of the stars can be
significantly lower than those of stars formed from gas initially within the
LMC.
"
What are the quantum effects of the interactions in the XXZ spin-1/2 Heisenberg chain?,"  The anisotropic XXZ spin-1/2 Heisenberg chain is studied using
renormalization-group theory. The specific heats and nearest-neighbor spin-spin
correlations are calculated thoughout the entire temperature and anisotropy
ranges in both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic regions, obtaining a global
description and quantitative results. We obtain, for all anisotropies, the
antiferromagnetic spin-liquid spin-wave velocity and the Isinglike
ferromagnetic excitation spectrum gap, exhibiting the spin-wave to spinon
crossover. A number of characteristics of purely quantum nature are found: The
in-plane interaction s_i^x s_j^x + s_i^y s_j^y induces an antiferromagnetic
correlation in the out-of-plane s_i^z component, at higher temperatures in the
antiferromagnetic XXZ chain, dominantly at low temperatures in the
ferromagnetic XXZ chain, and, in-between, at all temperatures in the XY chain.
We find that the converse effect also occurs in the antiferromagnetic XXZ
chain: an antiferromagnetic s_i^z s_j^z interaction induces a correlation in
the s_i^xy component. As another purely quantum effect, (i) in the
antiferromagnet, the value of the specific heat peak is insensitive to
anisotropy and the temperature of the specific heat peak decreases from the
isotropic (Heisenberg) with introduction of either type (Ising or XY)
anisotropy; (ii) in complete contrast, in the ferromagnet, the value and
temperature of the specific heat peak increase with either type of anisotropy.
"
What are the properties of the resonance fluorescence of a single two-level atom?,"  A full characterization of nonclassical space-time dependent correlations of
radiation is formulated in terms of normally and time-ordered field correlation
functions. It describes not only the properties of initially prepared multimode
radiation fields, but also the dynamics of radiation sources. Some of these
correlation effects occur in the resonance fluorescence of a single two-level
atom.
"
What are the basic operations for manipulating data in a quantum database?,"  Manipulating a database system on a quantum computer is an essential aim to
benefit from the promising speed-up of quantum computers over classical
computers in areas that take a vast amount of storage and processing time such
as in databases. In this paper, the basic operations for manipulating the data
in a quantum database will be defined, e.g. INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, SELECT,
backing up and restoring a database file. This gives the ability to perform the
data processing that usually takes a long processing time on a classical
database system, in a simultaneous way on a quantum computer. Defining a
quantum version of more advanced concepts used in database systems, e.g. the
referential integrity and the relational algebra, is a normal extension to this
work
"
What is the application of modular multiplicative unitary operator W to a quantum group defined by a modular multiplicative unitary operator W?,"  It is shown that all important features of a $\mathrm{C}^*$-algebraic quantum
group $(A,\Delta)$ defined by a modular multiplicative $W$ depend only on the
pair $(A,\Delta)$ rather than the multiplicative unitary operator $W$. The
proof is based on thorough study of representations of quantum groups. As an
application we present a construction and study properties of the universal
dual of a quantum group defined by a modular multiplicative unitary - without
assuming existence of Haar weights.
"
What is the relationship between the Zeeman effect and the field-independent exchange contribution?,"  The spin degeneracy of the lowest subband that carries one-dimensional
electron transport in quantum point contacts appears to be spontaneously lifted
in zero magnetic field due to a phenomenon that is known as the 0.7 anomaly. We
measured this energy splitting, and studied how it evolves into a splitting
that is the sum of the Zeeman effect and a field-independent exchange
contribution when applying a magnetic field. While this exchange contribution
shows sample-to-sample fluctuations, it is for all QPCs correlated with the
zero-field splitting of the 0.7 anomaly. This provides evidence that the
splitting of the 0.7 anomaly is dominated by this field-independent exchange
splitting.
"
What are the implications of the effective interactions of photons with spin-zero particles?,"  If the recent PVLAS results on polarization changes of a linearly polarized
laser beam passing through a magnetic field are interpreted by an axion-like
particle, it is almost certain that it is not a standard QCD axion. Considering
this, we study the general effective interactions of photons with spin-zero
particles without restricting the latter to be a pseudo-scalar or a scalar,
i.e., a parity eigenstate. At the lowest order in effective field theory, there
are two dimension-5 interactions, each of which has previously been treated
separately for a pseudo-scalar or a scalar particle. By following the evolution
in an external magnetic field of the system of spin-zero particles and photons,
we compute the changes in light polarization and the transition probability for
two experimental set-ups: one-way propagation and round-trip propagation. While
the first may be relevant for astrophysical sources of spin-zero particles, the
second applies to laboratory optical experiments like PVLAS. In the one-way
propagation, interesting phenomena can occur for special configurations of
polarization where, for instance, transition occurs but light polarization does
not change. For the round-trip propagation, however, the standard results of
polarization changes for a pseudoscalar or a scalar are only modified by a
factor that depends on the relative strength of the two interactions.
"
What is the exact lattice-continuum relation in QCD?,"  We study a three dimensional Z(3)-symmetric effective theory of high
temperature QCD. The exact lattice-continuum relations, needed in order to
perform lattice simulations with physical parameters, are computed to order
O(a^0) in lattice perturbation theory. Lattice simulations are performed to
determine the phase structure of a subset of the parameter space.
"
"How do thermal conduction, radiation and heating influence the damping of magnetoacoustic waves?","  Context. One of the typical features shown by observations of solar
prominence oscillations is that they are damped in time and that the values of
the damping times are usually between one and three times the corresponding
oscillatory period. However, the mechanism responsible for the attenuation is
still not well-known. Aims. Thermal conduction, optically thin or thick
radiation and heating are taken into account in the energy equation, and their
role on the attenuation of prominence oscillations is evaluated. Methods. The
dispersion relation for linear non-adiabatic magnetoacoustic waves is derived
considering an equilibrium made of a prominence plasma slab embedded in an
unbounded corona. The magnetic field is orientated along the direction parallel
to the slab axis and has the same strength in all regions. By solving the
dispersion relation for a fixed wavenumber, a complex oscillatory frequency is
obtained, and the period and the damping time are computed. Results. The effect
of conduction and radiation losses is different for each magnetoacoustic mode
and depends on the wavenumber. In the observed range of wavelengths the
internal slow mode is attenuated by radiation from the prominence plasma, the
fast mode by the combination of prominence radiation and coronal conduction and
the external slow mode by coronal conduction. The consideration of the external
corona is of paramount importance in the case of the fast and external slow
modes, whereas it does not affect the internal slow modes at all. Conclusions.
Non-adiabatic effects are efficient damping mechanisms for magnetoacoustic
modes, and the values of the obtained damping times are compatible with those
observed.
"
What is the relationship between the family of languages accepted by M-automata and the part of the monoid M that lies outside the maximal ideal?,"  We show that for any monoid M, the family of languages accepted by M-automata
(or equivalently, generated by regular valence grammars over M) is completely
determined by that part of M which lies outside the maximal ideal. Hence, every
such family arises as the family of languages accepted by N-automata where N is
a simple or 0-simple monoid. A consequence is that every such family is either
the class of regular languages, contains all the blind one-counter languages,
or is the family of languages accepted by G-automata for G a non-locally-finite
torsion group.
  We consider a natural extension of the usual definition which permits the
automata to utilise more of the structure of each monoid, and also allows us to
define S-automata for S an arbitrary semigroup. In the monoid case, the
resulting automata are equivalent to the valence automata with rational target
sets} which arise in the theory of regulated rewriting systems. We study the
case that the register semigroup is completely simple or completely 0-simple,
obtaining a complete characterisation of the classes of languages corresponding
to such semigroups in terms of their maximal subgroups. In the process, we
obtain a number of results about rational subsets of Rees matrix semigroups
which may be of independent interest.
"
What is the relationship between the algebra $C(X)$ and the algebra $D$?,"  Suppose $A$ is a separable unital $C(X)$-algebra each fibre of which is
isomorphic to the same strongly self-absorbing and $K_{1}$-injective
$C^{*}$-algebra $D$. We show that $A$ and $C(X) \otimes D$ are isomorphic as
$C(X)$-algebras provided the compact Hausdorff space $X$ is finite-dimensional.
This statement is known not to extend to the infinite-dimensional case.
"
What is the natural additional axiom for strict deformation quantization?,"  In the standard example of strict deformation quantization of the symplectic
sphere $S^2$, the set of allowed values of the quantization parameter $\hbar$
is not connected; indeed, it is almost discrete. Li recently constructed a
class of examples (including $S^2$) in which $\hbar$ can take any value in an
interval, but these examples are badly behaved. Here, I identify a natural
additional axiom for strict deformation quantization and prove that it implies
that the parameter set for quantizing $S^2$ is never connected.
"
What is the abelian monoid of finitely generated projective modules over the universal localisation?,"  We describe all possible universal localisations of a hereditary ring in
terms of suitable full subcategories of the category of finitely presented
modules. For these universal localisations we then identify the category of
finitely presented bound modules over the universal localisation as being
equivalent to a certain full subcategory of the category of finitely presented
bound modules over the original ring. We also describe the abelian monoid of
finitely generated projective modules over the universal localisation.
"
"What is the impact of transmitter cooperation on the capacity improvement in a two-transmitter, two-receiver network?","  Capacity improvement from transmitter and receiver cooperation is
investigated in a two-transmitter, two-receiver network with phase fading and
full channel state information available at all terminals. The transmitters
cooperate by first exchanging messages over an orthogonal transmitter
cooperation channel, then encoding jointly with dirty paper coding. The
receivers cooperate by using Wyner-Ziv compress-and-forward over an analogous
orthogonal receiver cooperation channel. To account for the cost of
cooperation, the allocation of network power and bandwidth among the data and
cooperation channels is studied. It is shown that transmitter cooperation
outperforms receiver cooperation and improves capacity over non-cooperative
transmission under most operating conditions when the cooperation channel is
strong. However, a weak cooperation channel limits the transmitter cooperation
rate; in this case receiver cooperation is more advantageous.
Transmitter-and-receiver cooperation offers sizable additional capacity gain
over transmitter-only cooperation at low SNR, whereas at high SNR transmitter
cooperation alone captures most of the cooperative capacity improvement.

"
What is the relationship between the fidelity of the mixed state and the line of the phase transition in the Stoner-Hubbard model?,"  We study the fidelity approach to quantum phase transitions (QPTs) and apply
it to general thermal phase transitions (PTs). We analyze two particular cases:
the Stoner-Hubbard itinerant electron model of magnetism and the BCS theory of
superconductivity. In both cases we show that the sudden drop of the mixed
state fidelity marks the line of the phase transition. We conduct a detailed
analysis of the general case of systems given by mutually commuting
Hamiltonians, where the non-analyticity of the fidelity is directly related to
the non-analyticity of the relevant response functions (susceptibility and heat
capacity), for the case of symmetry-breaking transitions. Further, on the case
of BCS theory of superconductivity, given by mutually non-commuting
Hamiltonians, we analyze the structure of the system's eigenvectors in the
vicinity of the line of the phase transition showing that their sudden change
is quantified by the emergence of a generically non-trivial Uhlmann mixed state
geometric phase.

What is the concrete framework for realizing this paradigm?,"  I describe several broad features of a programme to understand gravity as an

"
What is the nature of the nonlinearity in the quantum mechanics that leads to a collapse of the wave function?,"  There are fundamental reasons as to why there should exist a reformulation of
quantum mechanics which does not refer to a classical spacetime manifold. It
follows as a consequence that quantum mechanics as we know it is a limiting
case of a more general nonlinear quantum theory, with the nonlinearity becoming
significant at the Planck mass/energy scale. This nonlinearity is responsible
for a dynamically induced collapse of the wave-function, during a quantum
measurement, and it hence falsifies the many-worlds interpretation of quantum
mechanics. We illustrate this conclusion using a mathematical model based on a
generalized Doebner-Goldin equation. The non-Hermitian part of the Hamiltonian
in this norm-preserving, nonlinear, Schrodinger equation dominates during a
quantum measurement, and leads to a breakdown of linear superposition.
"
What is the abscissa of the Bohr-Rogosinski for the ordinary Dirichlet series?,"  We prove that the abscissas of Bohr and Rogosinski for ordinary Dirichlet
series, mapping the right half-plane into the bounded convex domain $G\subset

estimates about these abscissas.
"
What are the implications of the Lin-Maldacena geometries for the number of vacuum states in the theory?,"  The Lin-Maldacena geometries are nonsingular gravity duals to degenerate
vacuum states of a family of field theories with SU(2|4) supersymmetry. In this
note, we show that at large N, where the number of vacuum states is large,
there is a natural `macroscopic' description of typical states, giving rise to
a set of coarse-grained geometries. For a given coarse-grained state, we can
associate an entropy related to the number of underlying microstates. We find a
simple formula for this entropy in terms of the data that specify the geometry.
We see that this entropy function is zero for the original microstate
geometries and maximized for a certain ``typical state'' geometry, which we
argue is the gravity dual to the zero-temperature limit of the thermal state of
the corresponding field theory. Finally, we note that the coarse-grained
geometries are singular if and only if the entropy function is non-zero.
"
What are the benefits of collaborative beamforming and cooperative transmission for wireless sensor networks?,"  Collaborative beamforming (CB) and cooperative transmission (CT) have
recently emerged as communication techniques that can make effective use of
collaborative/cooperative nodes to create a virtual
multiple-input/multiple-output (MIMO) system. Extending the lifetime of
networks composed of battery-operated nodes is a key issue in the design and
operation of wireless sensor networks. This paper considers the effects on
network lifetime of allowing closely located nodes to use CB/CT to reduce the
load or even to avoid packet-forwarding requests to nodes that have critical
battery life. First, the effectiveness of CB/CT in improving the signal
strength at a faraway destination using energy in nearby nodes is studied.
Then, the performance improvement obtained by this technique is analyzed for a
special 2D disk case. Further, for general networks in which
information-generation rates are fixed, a new routing problem is formulated as
a linear programming problem, while for other general networks, the cost for
routing is dynamically adjusted according to the amount of energy remaining and
the effectiveness of CB/CT. From the analysis and the simulation results, it is
seen that the proposed method can reduce the payloads of energy-depleting nodes
by about 90% in the special case network considered and improve the lifetimes
of general networks by about 10%, compared with existing techniques.
"
How do the Euler-Lagrange equations derived from these principles relate to the fractional differential equations?,"  In this paper, first a class of fractional differential equations are
obtained by using the fractional variational principles. We find a fractional
Lagrangian $L(x(t)$, where $_a^cD_t^\alpha x(t))$ and $0<\alpha< 1$, such that
the following is the corresponding Euler-Lagrange %
\begin{equation}_tD_b^\alpha(_a^cD_t^\alpha) x(t)+ b(t,x(t))(_a^cD_t^\alpha
x(t))+f(t,x(t))=0. \end{equation} % At last, exact solutions for some
Euler-Lagrange equations are presented. In particular, we consider the
following equations % \begin{equation}_tD_b^\alpha(_a^cD_t^\alpha x(t))=\lambda
x(t), (\lambda\in R) \end{equation} %
\begin{equation}_tD_b^\alpha(_a^cD_t^\alpha x(t))+g(t)_a^cD_t^\alpha x(t)=f(t),
\end{equation} where g(t) and f(t) are suitable functions.
"
What is the Landau pole of the one-loop coupling at Q^2=Λ^2 absent in the skeleton expansion of the Adler function?,"  Recently, P. M. Brooks and C.J. Maxwell [Phys. Rev. D{\bf 74} 065012 (2006)]
claimed that the Landau pole of the one-loop coupling at $Q^2=\Lambda^2$ is
absent from the leading one-chain term in a skeleton expansion of the Euclidean
Adler ${\cal D}$ function. Moreover, in this approximation one has continuity
along the Euclidean axis and a smooth infrared freezing, properties known to be
satisfied by the ""true"" Adler function. We show that crucial in the derivation
of these results is the use of a modified Borel summation, which leads
simultaneously to the loss of another fundamental property of the true Adler
function: the analyticity implied by the K\""allen-Lehmann representation.

What is the neutron width distribution of resonances below 350 eV inconsistent with a Porter-Thomas distribution?,"  We have determined the spins J of resonances in the 147Sm(n,gamma) reaction
by measuring multiplicities of gamma-ray cascades following neutron capture.
Using this technique, we were able to determine J values for all but 14 of the
140 known resonances below En = 1 keV, including 41 firm J assignments for
resonances whose spins previously were either unknown or tentative. These new
spin assignments, together with previously determined resonance parameters,
allowed us to extract separate level spacings and neutron strength functions
for J = 3 and 4 resonances. Furthermore, several statistical test of the data
indicate that very few resonances of either spin have been missed below En =
700eV. Because a non-statistical effect recently was reported near En = 350 eV
from an analysis of 147Sm(n,alpha) data, we divided the data into two regions;
0 < En < 350 eV and 350 < En < 700 eV. Using neutron widths from a previous
measurement and published techniques for correcting for missed resonances and
for testing whether data are consistent with a Porter-Thomas distribution, we
found that the reduced-neutron-width distribution for resonances below 350 eV
is consistent with the expected Porter-Thomas distribution. On the other hand,
we found that reduced-neutron-width data in the 350 < En < 700 eV region are
inconsistent with a Porter-Thomas distribution, but in good agreement with a
chi-squared distribution having two or more degrees of freedom. We discuss
possible explanations for these observed non-statistical effects and their
possible relation to similar effects previously observed in other nuclides.
"
What is the relationship between the compact and extended radio sources in the Galactic Plane?,"  Arcminute-resolution radio continuum images at 408 and 1420 MHz from the
Canadian Galactic Plane Survey (CGPS) have been used to reexamine radio sources
listed in the Kallas and Reich (1980) catalogue. This catalogue is of
particular interest to Galactic studies as it lists both extended and compact
radio sources found in the second Galactic quadrant. We have determined the
nature (extended vs. compact, Galactic vs. extragalactic) of all of these
bright radio sources. A number of large HII regions with no optical
counterparts are highlighted along with a sample of large radio galaxies. Many
sources previously thought to be extended Galactic objects are shown to be
point sources. A sample of point sources with flat or rising spectra between
408 and 1420 MHz has been compiled, and within this sample likely Gigahertz
Peaked Spectrum sources have been identified.
"
What is the behavior of low-energy spin fluctuations in the electron-doped Pr$_{1-x}$LaCe$_{x}$CuO$_{4}$ system?,"  The low-energy spin fluctuations in the electron-doped
Pr$_{1-x}$LaCe$_{x}$CuO$_{4}$ have been investigated over a wide concentration
range of 0.07$\leqslant$ $x$ $\leqslant$0.18 that spans from the
antiferromagnetic and non-superconducting phase to the superconducting and
paramagnetic phase. For all concentrations considered, the low energy
excitations exhibit commensurate peaks centered at the ($\pi$, $\pi$) position.
Our data show that the characteristics of the excitations, such as the
relaxation rate and the overall spectral weight, change rapidly when the system
enters the superconducting phase. The spin stiffness also decreases with
increasing $x$ in the superconducting phase and is extrapolated to zero at $x$
= 0.21 when the superconductivity disappears. These indicate a close relation
between the spin fluctuations and the superconductivity in the electron-doped
system.
"
What are the properties of chirped optical X-Shaped pulses propagating in material media without boundaries?,"  Since the early works[1-4] on the so-called nondiffracting waves (called also
Localized Waves), a great deal of results has been published on this important
subject, from both the theoretical and the experimental point of view.
Initially, the theory was developed taking into account only free space;
however, in recent years, it has been extended for more complex media
exhibiting effects such as dispersion[5-7], nonlinearity[8], anisotropy[9] and
losses[10]. Such extensions have been carried out along with the development of
efficient methods for obtaining nondiffracting beams and pulses in the
subluminal, luminal and superluminal regimes[11-18]. This paper (partly a
review) addresses some theoretical methods related to nondiffracting solutions
of the linear wave equation in unbounded homogeneous media, as well as to some
interesting applications of such waves. In section II we analyze the general
structure of the Localized Waves, develop the so called Generalized
Bidirectional Decomposition, and use it to obtain several luminal and
superluminal (especially X-shaped) nondiffracting solutions of the wave
equation. In section III we develop a space-time focusing method by a
continuous superposition of X-Shaped pulses of different velocities. Section IV
addresses the properties of chirped optical X-Shaped pulses propagating in
material media without boundaries. Finally, in Section V, we show how a
suitable superposition of Bessel beams can be used to obtain stationary
localized wave fields, with a static envelope and a high transverse
localization, and whose longitudinal intensity pattern can assume any desired
shape within a chosen interval of the propagation axis.
"
What is the strategy used to calibrate the MIPS 160 micron channel?,"  We describe the absolute calibration of the Multiband Imaging Photometer for
Spitzer (MIPS) 160 micron channel. After the on-orbit discovery of a near-IR
ghost image that dominates the signal for sources hotter than about 2000 K, we
adopted a strategy utilizing asteroids to transfer the absolute calibrations of
the MIPS 24 and 70 micron channels to the 160 micron channel. Near-simultaneous
observations at all three wavelengths are taken, and photometry at the two
shorter wavelengths is fit using the Standard Thermal Model. The 160 micron
flux density is predicted from those fits and compared with the observed 160
micron signal to derive the conversion from instrumental units to surface
brightness. The calibration factor we derive is 41.7 MJy/sr/MIPS160 (MIPS160
being the instrumental units). The scatter in the individual measurements of
the calibration factor, as well as an assesment of the external uncertainties
inherent in the calibration, lead us to adopt an uncertainty of 5.0
MJy/sr/MIPS160 (12%) for the absolute uncertainty on the 160 micron flux
density of a particular source as determined from a single measurement. For
sources brighter than about 2 Jy, non-linearity in the response of the 160
micron detectors produces an under-estimate of the flux density: for objects as
bright as 4 Jy, measured flux densities are likely to be ~20% too low. This
calibration has been checked against that of ISO (using ULIRGS) and IRAS (using
IRAS-derived diameters), and is consistent with those at the 5% level.
"
What are the main theoretical predictions for the nuclear equation of state (EoS) at high densities and/or extreme isospin?,"  The quest for the nuclear equation of state (EoS) at high densities and/or
extreme isospin is one of the longstanding problems of nuclear physics. Ab
initio calculations for the nuclear many-body problem make predictions for the
density and isospin dependence of the EoS far away from the saturation point of
nuclear matter. On the other hand, in recent years substantial progress has
been mode to constrain the EoS both, from the astrophysical side and from
accelerator based experiments. Heavy ion experiments support a soft EoS at
moderate densities while recent neutron star observations require a ``stiff''
high density behavior. Both constraints are discussed and shown to be in
agreement with the predictions from many-body theory.
"
What is the relationship between the bosonic string field theory and the Witten bosonic string field theory?,"  We investigate analytic solutions to Witten's bosonic string field theory and
Berkovits' WZW-type superstring field theory. We construct solutions with
parameters out of simpler ones, using a commutative monoid that includes the
family of wedge states. Our solutions are generalizations of solutions for
marginal deformations by nonsingular currents, and can also reproduce Schnabl's
tachyon vacuum solution in bosonic string field theory. This implies that such
known solutions are generated from simple solutions which are based on the
identity state. We also discuss gauge transformations and induced field
redefinitions for our solutions in both bosonic and super string field theory.
"
What is the significance of V.I. Arnol'd's adapted coordinate system in the study of asymptotic expansions?,"  The notion of an adapted coordinate system, introduced by V.I.Arnol'd, plays
an important role in the study of asymptotic expansions of oscillatory
integrals. In two dimensions, A.N.Varchenko gave sufficient conditions for the
adaptness of a given coordinate system and proved the existence of an adapted
coordinate system for a class of analytic functions without multiple
components. Varchenko's proof is based on Hironaka's theorem on the resolution
of singularities.
  In this article, we present a new, elementary and concrete approach to these
results, which is based on the Puiseux series expansion of roots of the given
function. Our method applies to arbitrary real analytic functions, and even
extends to arbitrary smooth functions of finite type. Moreover, by avoiding
Hironaka's theorem, we can give necessary and sufficient conditions for the
adaptedness of a given coordinate system in the smooth, finite type setting.
"
What is the Smoluchowski equation used to study particle distributions in the atmosphere?,"  We consider a three dimensional system consisting of a large number of small
spherical particles, distributed in a range of sizes and heights (with uniform
distribution in the horizontal direction). Particles move vertically at a
size-dependent terminal velocity. They are either allowed to merge whenever
they cross or there is a size ratio criterion enforced to account for collision
efficiency. Such a system may be described, in mean field approximation, by the
Smoluchowski kinetic equation with a differential sedimentation kernel, used to
study e.g. rain initiation and particle distributions in the atmosphere. We
solve the kinetic equation analytically to obtain steady state and self-similar
solutions in time and in height, using methods borrowed from weak turbulence
theory. Analytical results are compared with direct numerical simulations (DNS)
of moving and merging particles, and a good agreement is found.
"
What is the method used to calculate electromagnetic forces and torques for arbitrarily-shaped objects?,"  Optical tweezers and optical lattices are making it possible to control small
particles by means of electromagnetic forces and torques. In this context, a
method is presented in this work to calculate electromagnetic forces and
torques for arbitrarily-shaped objects in the presence of other objects
illuminated by a plane wave. The method is based upon an expansion of the
electromagnetic field in terms of multipoles around each object, which are in
turn used to derive forces and torques analytically. The calculation of
multipole coefficients are obtained numerically by means of the boundary
element method. Results are presented for both spherical and non-spherical
objects.
"
What are the prospects of using phase-stabilized femtosecond frequency combs to measure electronic transitions in atomic helium?,"  We analyze several possibilities for precisely measuring electronic
transitions in atomic helium by the direct use of phase-stabilized femtosecond
frequency combs. Because the comb is self-calibrating and can be shifted into
the ultraviolet spectral region via harmonic generation, it offers the prospect
of greatly improved accuracy for UV and far-UV transitions. To take advantage
of this accuracy an ultracold helium sample is needed. For measurements of the
triplet spectrum a magneto-optical trap (MOT) can be used to cool and trap
metastable 2^3S state atoms. We analyze schemes for measuring the two-photon
$2^3S \to 4^3S$ interval, and for resonant two-photon excitation to high
Rydberg states, $2^3S \to 3^3P \to n^3S,D$. We also analyze experiments on the
singlet-state spectrum. To accomplish this we propose schemes for producing and
trapping ultracold helium in the 1^1S or 2^1S state via intercombination
transitions. A particularly intriguing scenario is the possibility of measuring
the $1^1S \to 2^1S$ transition with extremely high accuracy by use of
two-photon excitation in a magic wavelength trap that operates identically for
both states. We predict a ``triple magic wavelength'' at 412 nm that could
facilitate numerous experiments on trapped helium atoms, because here the
polarizabilities of the 1^1S, 2^1S and 2^3S states are all similar, small, and
positive.
"
How do Feynman integrals evaluate to multiple polylogarithms?,"  In this talk I review the connections between Feynman integrals and multiple
polylogarithms. After an introductory section on loop integrals I discuss the
Mellin-Barnes transformation and shuffle algebras. In a subsequent section
multiple polylogarithms are introduced. Finally, I discuss how certain Feynman
integrals evaluate to multiple polylogarithms.
"
What are the implications of the disorder dependence on the transition temperature in a Pomeranchuk-type Fermi-surface instability?,"  We study the effect of disorder on the order parameter equation and
transition temperature of a Pomeranchuk-type Fermi-surface instability using
replica mean field theory. We consider the example of a phase transition to a
$d_{x^2 +y^2}$ type Fermi surface distortion, and show that, in the regime
where such a transition is second order, the transition temperature is reduced
by disorder in essentially the same way as that for a d-wave superconductor. We
argue that observing this disorder dependence of metal-to-metal transition
might be a useful indicator of a finite angular momentum Fermi surface
distortion.
"
What is the relationship between the twisted Alexander invariants of knots and sign-determined Reidemeister torsion?,"  Twisted Alexander invariants of knots are well-defined up to multiplication
of units. We get rid of this multiplicative ambiguity via a combinatorial
method and define normalized twisted Alexander invariants. We then show that
the invariants coincide with sign-determined Reidemeister torsion in a
normalized setting, and refine the duality theorem. We further obtain necessary
conditions on the invariants for a knot to be fibered, and study behavior of
the highest degrees of the invariants.
"
What are the relationships between the magnetic energy and correlation length and the index of initial power-law spectrum in the helical case?,"  We study the evolution of magnetic fields in freely decaying
magnetohydrodynamic turbulence. By quasi-linearizing the Navier-Stokes
equation, we solve analytically the induction equation in quasi-normal
approximation. We find that, if the magnetic field is not helical, the magnetic
energy and correlation length evolve in time respectively as E_B \propto
t^{-2(1+p)/(3+p)} and \xi_B \propto t^{2/(3+p)}, where p is the index of
initial power-law spectrum. In the helical case, the magnetic helicity is an
almost conserved quantity and forces the magnetic energy and correlation length
to scale as E_B \propto (log t)^{1/3} t^{-2/3} and \xi_B \propto (log t)^{-1/3}
t^{2/3}.
"
What are the key concepts in the development of wireless communication systems and imaging radar systems?,"  With the technological growth of broadband wireless technology like CDMA and
UWB, a lots of development efforts towards wireless communication system and
Imaging radar system are well justified. Efforts are also being imparted
towards a Convergence Technology.. the convergence between a communication and
radar technology which will result in ITS (Intelligent Transport System) and
other applications. This encourages present authors for this development. They
are trying to utilize or converge the communication technologies towards radar
and to achieve the Interference free and clutter free quality remote images of
targets using DS-UWB wireless technology.
"
What is the radiation used to induce damage in photorefractive materials?,"  The optical damage of photorefractive material, single LiNbO3 crystal, is
experimentally studied. The specimen has been illuminated with the radiation of
continuous Ar-laser (the wavelength of 488 nm) focused to 35?m spot. The
induced birefringence map is obtained by means of imaging polarimeter.
Promising resources of the experimental setup for detecting laser-induced
damage in photorefractive materials is demonstrated.
"
What is the main means of energy release for CMEs in the initial phase?,"  It remains an open question how magnetic energy is rapidly released in the
solar corona so as to create solar explosions such as solar flares and coronal
mass ejections (CMEs). Recent studies have confirmed that a system consisting
of a flux rope embedded in a background field exhibits a catastrophic behavior,
and the energy threshold at the catastrophic point may exceed the associated
open field energy. The accumulated free energy in the corona is abruptly
released when the catastrophe takes place, and it probably serves as the main
means of energy release for CMEs at least in the initial phase. Such a release
proceeds via an ideal MHD process in contrast with nonideal ones such as
magnetic reconnection. The catastrophe results in a sudden formation of
electric current sheets, which naturally provide proper sites for fast magnetic
reconnection. The reconnection may be identified with a solar flare associated
with the CME on one hand, and produces a further acceleration of the CME on the
other. On this basis, several preliminary suggestions are made for future
observational investigations, especially with the proposed KuaFu satellites, on
the roles of the MHD catastrophe and magnetic reconnection in the magnetic
energy release associated with CMEs and flares.
"
What are the key concepts of signal processing that recognize targets in real time?,"  It's the key research topic of signal processing that recognizing genuine
targets real time from the disturbed signal which has giant amount of data. A
quantum algorithm for pattern recognition of classical signal which has time
complexity O(sqrt(N)) is presented in this paper.
  Key Words: Pattern recognition, Grover's algorithm, Rotation on subspace

What are the expectations for the LHC?,"  Results from the Fermilab Tevatron pbar-p collider on diffractive and total
cross sections are reviewed with emphasis on physics significance and
properties pointing to expectations at the LHC.
"
What are the security features of the proposed scheme against a-posteriori known-plaintext attack on the key?,"  Although one-time pad encrypted files can be sent through Internet channels,
the need for renewing shared secret keys have made this method unpractical.
This work presents a scheme to turn practical the fast sharing of random keys
over arbitrary Internet channels. Starting with a shared secret key sequence of
length K_0 the users end up with a secure new sequence K >> K_0. Using these
sequences for posteriori message encryption the legitimate users have absolute
security control without the need for third parties. Additionally, the security
level does not depend on the unproven difficulty of factoring numbers in
primes. In the proposed scheme a fast optical random source generates random
bits and noise for key renewals. The transmitted signals are recorded signals
that carries both the random binary signals to be exchanged and physical noise
that cannot be eliminated by the attacker. These signals allow amplification
over the Internet network without degrading security. The proposed system is
also secure against a-posteriori known-plaintext attack on the key.
Information-theoretic analysis is presented and bounds for secure operation are
quantitatively determined.
"
What is the relationship between the transportation-information inequalities $T_cI$ and the Fisher-Donsker-Varadhan information $I(\nu|\mu)$?,"  In this paper, one investigates the following type of
transportation-information $T_cI$ inequalities: $\alpha(T_c(\nu,\mu))\le
I(\nu|\mu)$ for all probability measures $\nu$ on some metric space $(\XX, d)$,
where $\mu$ is a given probability measure, $T_c(\nu,\mu)$ is the
transportation cost from $\nu$ to $\mu$ with respect to some cost function
$c(x,y)$ on $\XX^2$, $I(\nu|\mu)$ is the Fisher-Donsker-Varadhan information of
$\nu$ with respect to $\mu$ and $\alpha: [0,\infty)\to [0,\infty]$ is some left
continuous increasing function. Using large deviation techniques, it is shown
that $T_cI$ is equivalent to some concentration inequality for the occupation
measure of a $\mu$-reversible ergodic Markov process related to $I(\cdot|\mu)$,
a counterpart of the characterizations of transportation-entropy inequalities,
recently obtained by Gozlan and L\'eonard in the i.i.d. case . Tensorization
properties of $T_cI$ are also derived.
"
What are the results of the Lattice QCD calculations of the low-lying spectrum of Nucleon and Delta baryons?,"  The Lattice Hadron Physics Collaboration (LHPC) baryon spectroscopy effort is
reviewed. To date the LHPC has performed exploratory Lattice QCD calculations
of the low-lying spectrum of Nucleon and Delta baryons. These calculations
demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by obtaining the masses of an
unprecedented number of excited states with definite quantum numbers. Future
work of the project is outlined.
"
What are the implications of the Hubble Diagram for the existence of dark matter?,"  The redshift-distance modulus relation, the Hubble Diagram, derived from
Cosmological General Relativity has been extended to arbitrarily large
redshifts. Numerical methods were employed and a density function was found
that results in a valid solution of the field equations at all redshifts. The
extension has been compared to 302 type Ia supernova data as well as to 69
Gamma-ray burst data. The latter however do not not truly represent a `standard
candle' as the derived distance modulii are not independent of the cosmology
used. Nevertheless the analysis shows a good fit can be achieved without the
need to assume the existence of dark matter.
  The Carmelian theory is also shown to describe a universe that is always
spatially flat. This results from the underlying assumption of the energy
density of a cosmological constant $\Omega_{\Lambda} = 1$, the result of vacuum
energy. The curvature of the universe is described by a \textit{spacevelocity}
metric where the energy content of the curvature at any epoch is $\Omega_K =
\Omega_{\Lambda} - \Omega = 1-\Omega$, where $\Omega$ is the matter density of
the universe. Hence the total density is always $\Omega_K + \Omega = 1$
"
What is the viewing angle of jets in BL Lac objects related to their intrinsic synchrotron peak frequency?,"  We present EVN observations of seven BL Lac objects selected from the RGB
sample. To investigate the intrinsic radiation property of BL Lac objects, we
estimated the Doppler factor with the VLA or MERLIN core and the total 408 MHz
luminosity for a sample of 170 BL Lac objects. The intrinsic (comoving)
synchrotron peak frequency was then calculated by using the estimated Doppler
factor. Assuming a Lorentz factor of 5, the viewing angle of jets was
constrained. The high-resolution VLBI images of seven sources all show a
core-jet structure. We estimated the proper motions of three sources with the
VLBI archive data, and find that the apparent speed increases with the distance
of components to the core for all of them. In our BL Lacs sample, the Doppler
factor of LBLs is systematically larger than that of IBLs and HBLs. We find a
significant anti-correlation between the total 408 MHz luminosity and the
intrinsic synchrotron peak frequency. However, the scatter is much larger than
for the blazar sequence. Moreover, we find a significant positive correlation
between the viewing angle and the intrinsic synchrotron peak frequency. The BL
Lac objects show a continuous distribution on the viewing angle. While LBLs
have a smaller viewing angle than that of IBLs and HBLs, IBLs are comparable to
HBLs. We conclude that the intrinsic synchrotron peak frequency is not only
related to the intrinsic radio power (though with a large scatter), but also to
the viewing angle for the present sample.
"
What is the non-minimal pure spinor quantization of superstrings in the Y-formalism?,"  We present the Y-formalism for the non-minimal pure spinor quantization of
superstrings. In the framework of this formalism we compute, at the quantum
level, the explicit form of the compound operators involved in the construction
of the $b$ ghost, their normal-ordering contributions and the relevant
relations among them. We use these results to construct the quantum-mechanical
$b$ ghost in the non-minimal pure spinor formalism. Moreover we show that this
non-minimal $b$ ghost is cohomologically equivalent to the non-covariant $b$
ghost.
"
What is the Trotter discretization error in the HF-QMC method?,"  Since the inception of the dynamical mean-field theory, numerous numerical
studies have relied on the Hirsch-Fye quantum Monte Carlo (HF-QMC) method for
solving the associated impurity problem. Recently developed continuous-time
algorithms (CT-QMC) avoid the Trotter discretization error and allow for faster
configuration updates, which makes them candidates for replacing HF-QMC. We
demonstrate, however, that a state-of-the-art implementation of HF-QMC (with
extrapolation of discretization delta_tau -> 0) is competitive with CT-QMC. A
quantitative analysis of Trotter errors in HF-QMC estimates and of appropriate
delta_tau values is included.
"
What are the spin wave modes in a ferromagnet with finite size?,"  Motivated by the recently observed pattern of unidirectional domains in
high-T_c superconductors [Y. Kohsaka et al., Science 315, 1380 (2007)], we
investigate the emergence of spontaneous modulations in the d-wave
superconducting resonating valence bond phase using the t-J model at x=1/8
doping. Half-filled charge domains separated by four lattice spacings are found
to form along one of the crystal axis leading to modulated superconductivity
with out-of-phase d-wave order parameters in neighboring domains. Both
renormalized mean-field theory and variational Monte Carlo calculations yield
that the energies of modulated and uniform phases are very close to each other.
"
What are the field equations of the gravitational field in the absence of matter and other kinds of sources?,"  We analyze an alternative theory of gravity characterized by metrics that are
tensor density of rank(0,2)and weight-1/2.The metric compatibility condition is
supposed to hold. The simplest expression for the action of gravitational field
is used.Taking the metric and trace of connections as dynamical variables,the
field equations in the absence of matter and other kinds of sources are
derived.The solutions of these equations are obtained for the case of vacuum
static spherical symmetric spacetime.The null geodesics and advance of
perihelion of ellipes are discussed.We confirm a subclass of solutions is
regular for r>0 and there is no event horizon while it is singular at r=0.
"
What is the relationship between the quenching of the prompt photon and pion yield and the energy loss processes in Au-Au collisions?,"  Single prompt photon and pion spectra in p-p and Au-Au collisions at
intermediate RHIC energy, s^1/2 = 62.4 GeV, are computed at large transverse
momentum in perturbative QCD. Next-to-leading order calculations in p-p
scattering are first presented. The quenching of the prompt photon and pion
yield due to energy loss processes in central Au-Au with respect to p-p
collisions is then predicted. At this energy, the small phase-space available
to produce hard partons makes the pion quenching almost as pronounced as at
s^1/2 = 200 GeV, despite the smaller gluon density of the produced medium. In
the photon sector, energy loss effects prove small because of this very
phase-space restriction, which favours the direct production channel. A
significant suppression of high-pt photons is however predicted, because of a
strong isospin effect together with the depletion of nuclear parton densities
at large x.
"
What are the key concepts of the arbitrary complex functions?,"  A method to solve the static field equation of the Faddeev model is
presented. For an special combination of the concerned field, we adopt a form
which is compatible with the field equation and involves two arbitrary complex
functions. As a result, the static field equation is reduced to a set of first
order partial differential equations.
"
What are the distinct spin wave modes observed in a ferromagnet with finite size?,"  Fil {\it et al.} has proposed an interesting experimental method to
investigate vortex dynamics. Some preliminary results have been obtained. In
this comment I discuss a few missing but strongly related theoretical models
and experiments on Hall anomaly and Magnus force. I conclude that those missing
literature can enhance the value of novel experimental method proposed in the
commented 2006 Europhysics Letters by Fil {\it et al.}.
"
"What is the new estimate of the height of the tallest running, breathing organism on a habitable planet?","  A minor modification of the arguments of Press and Lightman leads to an
estimate of the height of the tallest running, breathing organism on a
habitable planet as the Bohr radius multiplied by the three-tenths power of the
ratio of the electrical to gravitational forces between two protons (rather
than the one-quarter power that Press got for the largest animal that would not
break in falling over, after making an assumption of unreasonable brittleness).
My new estimate gives a height of about 3.6 meters rather than Press's original
estimate of about 2.6 cm. It also implies that the number of atoms in the
tallest runner is very roughly of the order of the nine-tenths power of the
ratio of the electrical to gravitational forces between two protons, which is
about 3 x 10^32.
"
What is the scattering representation space for a CMV matrix?,"  Adamjan-Arov (Lax--Phillips) model space is considered as a scattering
representation space for a CMV matrix in context of an extended
Marchenko--Faddeev scattering theory. That is, there exists a basis in which
the multiplication by independent variable is a CMV matrix. This basis as well
as Verblunski coefficients are computed explicitly in terms of Nehari
interpolation. Asymptotically the Verblynski coefficients go to zero. Moreover,
relations between the basis and wandering subspaces are established.
Transformation from scattering representation to spectral representation is
given.
"
What is the role of metal ions in the electronic and transport properties of M(II)Pc systems?,"  Using first principles calculations in the framework of Density Functional
Theory, we investigated the electronic and transport properties of
metal(II)-phthalocyanine (M(II)Pc) systems, both in a single molecule
configuration and in a model-device geometry. In particular, using the
Copper(II)- and Manganese(II)-Pc as prototypical examples, we studied how
electronic correlations on the central metal-ion influence the analysis of the
electronic structure of the system and we demonstrated that the choice of the
exchange-correlation functional, also beyond the standard local or gradient
corrected level, is of crucial importance for a correct interpretation of the
data. Finally, our electronic transport simulations have shown that
M(II)Pc-based devices can act selectively as molecular conductors, as in the
case of Copper, or as spin valves, as in the case of Manganese, demonstrating
once more the great potential of these systems for molecular nanoelectronics
applications.
"
What is the sequence of the two-scale solution of a limit evolution problem?,"  We study the limit as $\e\to 0$ of the entropy solutions of the equation
$\p_t \ue + \dv_x[A(\frac{x}{\e},\ue)] =0$. We prove that the sequence $\ue$
two-scale converges towards a function $u(t,x,y)$, and $u$ is the unique
solution of a limit evolution problem. The remarkable point is that the limit
problem is not a scalar conservation law, but rather a kinetic equation in
which the macroscopic and microscopic variables are mixed. We also prove a
strong convergence result in $L^1_{\text{loc}}$.
"
What is the modified algorithm for calculating the evolution of a ferromagnet with finite size?,"  We describe a modification of a fourth-order accurate ``moving puncture''
evolution code, where by replacing spatial fourth-order accurate differencing
operators in the bulk of the grid by a specific choice of sixth-order accurate
stencils we gain significant improvements in accuracy. We illustrate the
performance of the modified algorithm with an equal-mass simulation covering
nine orbits.
"
What are the effects of a fixed baryon charge density on the pion and vector meson masses and couplings in holographic QCD?,"  In the context of holographic QCD we analyze Sakai-Sugimoto's chiral model at
finite baryon density and zero temperature. The baryon number density is
introduced through compact D4 wrapping S^4 at the tip of D8-\bar{D8}. Each
baryon acts as a chiral point-like source distributed uniformly over R^3, and
leads a non-vanishing U(1)_V potential on the brane. For fixed baryon charge
density n_B we analyze the bulk energy density and pressure using the canonical
formalism. The baryonic matter with point like sources is always in the
spontaneously broken phase of chiral symmetry, whatever the density. The
point-like nature of the sources and large N_c cause the matter to be repulsive
as all baryon interactions are omega mediated. Through the induced DBI action
on D8-\bar{D8}, we study the effects of the fixed baryon charge density n_B on
the pion and vector meson masses and couplings. Issues related to vector
dominance in matter in the context of holographic QCD are also discussed.
"
How is the temperature of a trapped atom measured using a semiclassical approach?,"  We investigate the temporal dynamics of Doppler cooling of an initially hot
single trapped atom in the weak binding regime using a semiclassical approach.
We develop an analytical model for the simplest case of a single vibrational
mode for a harmonic trap, and show how this model allows us to estimate the
initial energy of the trapped particle by observing the fluorescence rate
during the cooling process. The experimental implementation of this temperature
measurement provides a way to measure atom heating rates by observing the
temperature rise in the absence of cooling. This method is technically
relatively simple compared to conventional sideband detection methods, and the
two methods are in reasonable agreement. We also discuss the effects of RF
micromotion, relevant for a trapped atomic ion, and the effect of coupling
between the vibrational modes on the cooling dynamics.

What is the quantum query complexity bound for testing algebraic properties?,"  We present quantum query complexity bounds for testing algebraic properties.
For a set S and a binary operation on S, we consider the decision problem
whether $S$ is a semigroup or has an identity element. If S is a monoid, we
want to decide whether S is a group.
  We present quantum algorithms for these problems that improve the best known
classical complexity bounds. In particular, we give the first application of
the new quantum random walk technique by Magniez, Nayak, Roland, and Santha
that improves the previous bounds by Ambainis and Szegedy. We also present
several lower bounds for testing algebraic properties.
"
What are the sources of high energy emission in gamma-ray bursts?,"  Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) have been detected at GeV energies by EGRET and
models predict emission at > 100 GeV. Milagro is a wide field (2 sr) high duty
cycle (> 90 %) ground based water Cherenkov detector that records extensive air
showers in the energy range 100 GeV to 100 TeV. We have searched for very high
energy emission from a sample of 106 gamma-ray bursts (GRB) detected since the
beginning of 2000 by BATSE, BeppoSax, HETE-2, INTEGRAL, Swift or the IPN. No
evidence for emission from any of the bursts has been found and we present
upper limits from these bursts.
"
What is the relationship between the energy fluence and the rest-frame isotropic-equivalent radiated energy for the 47 GRBs?,"  We study the spectral and energetics properties of 47 long-duration gamma-ray
bursts (GRBs) with known redshift, all of them detected by the Swift satellite.
Due to the narrow energy range (15-150 keV) of the Swift-BAT detector, the
spectral fitting is reliable only for fitting models with 2 or 3 parameters. As
high uncertainty and correlation among the errors is expected, a careful
analysis of the errors is necessary. We fit both the power law (PL, 2
parameters) and cut--off power law (CPL, 3 parameters) models to the
time-integrated spectra of the 47 bursts, and present the corresponding
parameters, their uncertainties, and the correlations among the uncertainties.
The CPL model is reliable only for 29 bursts for which we estimate the nuf_nu
peak energy Epk. For these GRBs, we calculate the energy fluence and the rest-
frame isotropic-equivalent radiated energy, Eiso, as well as the propagated
uncertainties and correlations among them. We explore the distribution of our
homogeneous sample of GRBs on the rest-frame diagram E'pk vs Eiso. We confirm a
significant correlation between these two quantities (the ""Amati"" relation) and
we verify that, within the uncertainty limits, no outliers are present. We also
fit the spectra to a Band model with the high energy power law index frozen to
-2.3, obtaining a rather good agreement with the ""Amati"" relation of non-Swift
GRBs.
"
What is the secrecy capacity region for the fading broadcast channel with confidential messages?,"  The fading broadcast channel with confidential messages (BCC) is
investigated, where a source node has common information for two receivers
(receivers 1 and 2), and has confidential information intended only for
receiver 1. The confidential information needs to be kept as secret as possible
from receiver 2. The channel state information (CSI) is assumed to be known at
both the transmitter and the receivers. The secrecy capacity region is first
established for the parallel Gaussian BCC, and the optimal source power
allocations that achieve the boundary of the secrecy capacity region are
derived. In particular, the secrecy capacity region is established for the
Gaussian case of the Csiszar-Korner BCC model. The secrecy capacity results are
then applied to give the ergodic secrecy capacity region for the fading BCC.
"
What is the relationship between quasi-black holes and extremal black holes?,"  Objects that are on the verge of being extremal black holes but actually are
distinct in many ways are called quasi-black holes. Quasi-black holes are
defined here and treated in a unified way through the displaying of their
properties. The main ones are (i) there are infinite redshift whole regions,
(ii) the spacetimes exhibit degenerate, almost singular, features but their
curvature invariants remain perfectly regular everywhere, (iii) in the limit
under discussion, outer and inner regions become mutually impenetrable and
disjoint, although, in contrast to the usual black holes, this separation is of
a dynamical nature, rather than purely causal, (iv) for external far away
observers the spacetime is virtually indistinguishable from that of extremal
black holes. It is shown, in addition, that quasi-black holes must be extremal.
Connections with black hole and wormhole physics are also drawn.
"
What is the relationship between the $B_c$ meson decay and the $B_s$ meson in the final state?,"  We discuss the possibility for observing $B_c$ mesons in decay channels with
$B_s$ in final state.
"
What is the effect of viscosity on a rotating disk in the presence of a constant magnetic field?,"  We carry out the self-similar solutions of viscous-resistive accretion flows
around a magnetized compact object. We consider an axisymmetric, rotating,
isotheral steady accretion flow which contains a poloidal magnetic field of the
central star. The dominant mechanism of energy dissipation is assumed to be the
turbulence viscosity and magnetic diffusivity due to magnetic field of the
central star. We explore the effect of viscosity on a rotating disk in the
presence of constant magnetic diffusivity. We show that the dynamical
quantities of ADAFs are sensitive to the advection and viscosity parameters.
Increase of the $\alpha$ coefficient in the $\alpha$-prescription model
decreases the radial velocity and increases the density of the flow. It also
affects the poloidal magnetic field considerably.
"
What are the factors affecting the interpretation of data on metal-poor stars in the Galaxy and dwarf spheroidal galaxies?,"  The concomitant overabundances of C, N and s-process elements are commonly
ascribed to the complex interplay of nucleosynthesis, mixing and mass loss
taking place in Asymptotic Giant Branch stars. At low metallicity, the
enhancement of C and/or N may be up to 1000 times larger than the original iron
content and significantly affects the stellar structure and its evolution. For
this reason, the interpretation of the already available and still growing
amount of data concerning C-rich metal-poor stars belonging to our Galaxy as
well as to dwarf spheroidal galaxies would require reliable AGB stellar models
for low and very low metallicities. In this paper we address the question of
calculation and use of appropriate opacity coefficients, which take into
account the C enhancement caused by the third dredge up. A possible N
enhancement, caused by the cool bottom process or by the engulfment of protons
into the convective zone generated by a thermal pulse and the subsequent huge
third dredge up, is also considered. Basing on up-to-date stellar models, we
illustrate the changes induced by the use of these opacity on the physical and
chemical properties expected for these stars.
"
What is the role of atomic decoherence in the visibility of photon echoes?,"  High-visibility interference of photon echoes generated in spatially
separated solid-state atomic ensembles is demonstrated. The solid state
ensembles were LiNbO$_3$ waveguides doped with Erbium ions absorbing at 1.53
$\mu$m. Bright coherent states of light in several temporal modes (up to 3) are
stored and retrieved from the optical memories using two-pulse photon echoes.
The stored and retrieved optical pulses, when combined at a beam splitter, show
almost perfect interference, which demonstrates both phase preserving storage
and indistinguishability of photon echoes from separate optical memories. By
measuring interference fringes for different storage times, we also show
explicitly that the visibility is not limited by atomic decoherence. These
results are relevant for novel quantum repeaters architectures with photon echo
based multimode quantum memories.
"
What are the advantages of the SILEM grid compared to the LEM grid?,"  This works reports on gaseous detectors developments made in the frame of the
EXO double-beta decay experiment. LEM (Large Electron Multiplication) are
electron amplification grids based on GEM. They were developed in Neuchatel and
showed remarquable resistance to sparks. The new SILEM grid combines the
properties of the standard LEM with a micropatterned x-y readout plane on one
of the grid side. It allows thus the amplification of the primary electrons and
their position determination in the x-y plane.
"
What is the relationship between the walls of marginal stability and Farey sequences and Ford circles?,"  We study general two-body decays of primitive and non-primitive 1/4-BPS dyons
in four-dimensional type IIB string compactifications. We find a ``master
equation'' for marginal stability that generalises the curve found by Sen for
half-BPS decay, and analyse this equation in a variety of cases including
decays to 1/4-BPS products. For half-BPS decays, an interesting and useful
relation is exhibited between walls of marginal stability and the mathematics
of Farey sequences and Ford circles. We exhibit an example in which two curves
of marginal stability intersect in the interior of moduli space.
"
"What are the implications of the low-mass, low-kick neutron stars in the Galactic disk?","  Six of the eight double neutron stars known in the Galactic disk have low
orbital eccentricities (< 0.27) indicating that their second-born neutron stars
received only very small velocity kicks at birth. This is similar to the case
of the B-emission X-ray binaries, where a sizable fraction of the neutron stars
received hardly any velocity kick at birth (Pfahl et al. 2002). The masses of
the second-born neutron stars in five of the six low-eccentricity double
neutron stars are remarkably low (between 1.18 and 1.30 Msun). It is argued
that these low-mass, low-kick neutron stars were formed by the electron-capture
collapse of the degenerate O-Ne-Mg cores of helium stars less massive than
about 3.5 Msun, whereas the higher-mass, higher kick-velocity neutron stars
were formed by the collapses of the iron cores of higher initial mass. The
absence of low-velocity single young radio pulsars (Hobbs et al. 2005) is
consistent with the model proposed by Podsiadlowski et al. (2004), in which the
electron-capture collapse of degenerate O-Ne-Mg cores can only occur in binary
systems, and not in single stars.
"
What is an example of a type I C*-algebra A such that M_loc(M_loc(A)) is not equal to M_loc(A)?,"  A new C*-enlargement of a C*-algebra $A$ nested between the local multiplier
algebra $M_{\text{loc}}(A)$ of $A$ and its injective envelope $I(A)$ is
introduced. Various aspects of this maximal C*-algebra of quotients,
$Q_{\text{max}}(A)$, are studied, notably in the setting of AW*-algebras. As a
by-product we obtain a new example of a type I C*-algebra $A$ such that
$M_{\text{loc}}(M_{\text{loc}}(A))\ne M_{\text{loc}}(A)$.
"
What is the condition for drawing a plane graph with a straight line in the worst-case scenario?,"  We prove that if one wants to make a plane graph drawing straight-line then
in the worst case one has to move almost all vertices.
"
What are the properties of metabolic networks that can be reconstructed using these algorithms?,"  We investigate the ability of algorithms developed for reverse engineering of
transcriptional regulatory networks to reconstruct metabolic networks from
high-throughput metabolite profiling data. For this, we generate synthetic
metabolic profiles for benchmarking purposes based on a well-established model
for red blood cell metabolism. A variety of data sets is generated, accounting
for different properties of real metabolic networks, such as experimental
noise, metabolite correlations, and temporal dynamics. These data sets are made
available online. We apply ARACNE, a mainstream transcriptional networks
reverse engineering algorithm, to these data sets and observe performance
comparable to that obtained in the transcriptional domain, for which the
algorithm was originally designed.
"
What is the empirical algorithm for constructing dark-matter halo merger trees?,"  We present a simple and efficient empirical algorithm for constructing
dark-matter halo merger trees that reproduce the distribution of trees in the
Millennium cosmological $N$-body simulation. The generated trees are
significantly better than EPS trees. The algorithm is Markovian, and it
therefore fails to reproduce the non-Markov features of trees across short time
steps, except for an accurate fit to the evolution of the average main
progenitor. However, it properly recovers the full main progenitor distribution
and the joint distributions of all the progenitors over long-enough time steps,
$\Delta \omega \simeq \Delta z>0.5$, where $\omega \simeq 1.69/D(t)$ is the
self-similar time variable and $D(t)$ refers to the linear growth of density
fluctuations. We find that the main progenitor distribution is log-normal in
the variable $\sigma^2(M)$, the variance of linear density fluctuations in a
sphere encompassing mass $M$. The secondary progenitors are successfully drawn
one by one from the remaining mass using a similar distribution function. These
empirical findings may be clues to the underlying physics of merger-tree
statistics. As a byproduct, we provide useful, accurate analytic time-invariant
approximations for the main progenitor accretion history and for halo merger
rates.
"
What are the key differences between an n-qubit quantum computer and a duality computer?,"  Quantum computer possesses quantum parallelism and offers great computing
power over classical computer \cite{er1,er2}. As is well-know, a moving quantum
object passing through a double-slit exhibits particle wave duality. A quantum
computer is static and lacks this duality property. The recently proposed
duality computer has exploited this particle wave duality property, and it may
offer additional computing power \cite{r1}. Simply put it, a duality computer
is a moving quantum computer passing through a double-slit. A duality computer
offers the capability to perform separate operations on the sub-waves coming
out of the different slits, in the so-called duality parallelism. Here we show
that an $n$-dubit duality computer can be modeled by an $(n+1)$-qubit quantum
computer. In a duality mode, computing operations are not necessarily unitary.
A $n$-qubit quantum computer can be used as an $n$-bit reversible classical
computer and is energy efficient. Our result further enables a $(n+1)$-qubit
quantum computer to run classical algorithms in a $O(2^n)$-bit classical
computer. The duality mode provides a natural link between classical computing
and quantum computing. Here we also propose a recycling computing mode in which
a quantum computer will continue to compute until the result is obtained. These
two modes provide new tool for algorithm design. A search algorithm for the
unsorted database search problem is designed.
"
What are the implications of the frequency and temperature dependence of the charge noise in Josephson qubits?,"  We show that charge noise $S_Q$ in Josephson qubits can be produced by
fluctuating two level systems (TLS) with electric dipole moments in the
substrate using a flat density of states. At high frequencies the frequency and
temperature dependence of the charge noise depends on the ratio $J/J_c$ of the
electromagnetic flux $J$ to the critical flux $J_c$. It is not widely
appreciated that TLS in small qubits can easily be strongly saturated with
$J/J_c\gg 1$. Our results are consistent with experimental conclusions that
$S_Q\sim 1/f$ at low frequencies and $S_Q\sim f$ at high frequencies.
"
What are the high-velocity clouds in the simulated galaxy observed in the vicinity of the galactic disk?,"  Simulations of an isolated Milky Way-like galaxy, in which supernovae power a
galactic fountain, reproduce the observed velocity and 21cm brightness
statistics of galactic neutral hydrogen (HI). The simulated galaxy consists of
a thin HI disk, similar in extent and brightness to that observed in the Milky
Way, and extra-planar neutral gas at a range of velocities due to the galactic
fountain. Mock observations of the neutral gas resemble the HI flux
measurements from the Leiden-Argentine-Bonn (LAB) HI, survey, including a
high-velocity tail which matches well with observations of high-velocity
clouds. The simulated high-velocity clouds are typically found close to the
galactic disk, with a typical line-of-sight distance of 13kpc from observers on
the solar circle. The fountain efficiently cycles matter from the centre of the
galaxy to its outskirts at a rate of around 0.5 M_sun/yr
"
What are the S=-2 baryon-baryon interactions in chiral effective field theory?,"  We derive the leading order strangeness S=-2 baryon-baryon interactions in
chiral effective field theory. The potential consists of contact terms without
derivatives and of one-pseudoscalar-meson exchanges. The contact terms and the
couplings of the pseudoscalar mesons to the baryons are related via SU(3)
flavor symmetry to the S=-1 hyperon-nucleon channels. We show that the chiral
effective field theory predictions with natural values for the low-energy
constants agree with the experimental information in the S=-2 sector.
"
What are the mathematical models for the pricing of derivative securities in illiquid markets?,"  Several models for the pricing of derivative securities in illiquid markets
are discussed. A typical type of nonlinear partial differential equations
arising from these investigation is studied. The scaling properties of these
equations are discussed. Explicit solutions for one of the models are obtained
and studied.
"
How do the electromagnetic dipole-strength distributions of a nucleus relate to the photon-scattering cross-sections?,"  Electromagnetic dipole-strength distributions up to the particle separation
energies are studied for the stable even-even nuclides $^{92,94,96,98,100}$Mo
in photon scattering experiments at the superconducting electron accelerator
ELBE of the Forschungszentrum Dresden-Rossendorf. The influence of inelastic
transitions to low-lying excited states has been corrected by a simulation of
$\gamma$ cascades using a statistical model. After corrections for branching
ratios of ground-state transitions, the photon-scattering cross-sections
smoothly connect to data obtained from $(\gamma,n)$-reactions. With the newly
determined electromagnetic dipole response of nuclei well below the particle
separation energies the parametrisation of the isovector giant-dipole resonance
is done with improved precision.
"
What is the scheme over a perfect field?,"  We describe the maximal torus and maximal unipotent subgroup of the Picard
variety of a proper scheme over a perfect field.
"
What is the purpose of the Neutral-Current Detectors (NCDs) in the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory (SNO)?,"  An array of Neutral-Current Detectors (NCDs) has been built in order to make
a unique measurement of the total active flux of solar neutrinos in the Sudbury
Neutrino Observatory (SNO). Data in the third phase of the SNO experiment were
collected between November 2004 and November 2006, after the NCD array was
added to improve the neutral-current sensitivity of the SNO detector. This
array consisted of 36 strings of proportional counters filled with a mixture of
$^3$He and CF$_4$ gas capable of detecting the neutrons liberated by the
neutrino-deuteron neutral current reaction in the D$_2$O, and four strings
filled with a mixture of $^4$He and CF$_4$ gas for background measurements. The
proportional counter diameter is 5 cm. The total deployed array length was 398
m. The SNO NCD array is the lowest-radioactivity large array of proportional
counters ever produced. This article describes the design, construction,
deployment, and characterization of the NCD array, discusses the electronics
and data acquisition system, and considers event signatures and backgrounds.
"
What are the fractional charge constituents of instantons in the O(3) model at finite temperature?,"  It is shown that instantons in the O(3) model at finite temperature consist
of fractional charge constituents and the (topological) properties of the
latter are discussed.
"
What are the conditions for a quasianalytic class to be realized by the Riemann map?,"  We consider the Riemann Mapping Theorem in the case of a bounded simply
connected and semianalytic domain. We show that the germ at 0 of the Riemann
map (i.e. biholomorphic map) from the upper half plane to such a domain can be
realized in a certain quasianalytic class if the angle of the boundary at the
point to which 0 is mapped, is greater than 0. This quasianalytic class was
introduced and used by Ilyashenko in his work on Hilbert's 16th problem. With
this result we can prove that the Riemann map from a bounded simply connected
semianalytic domain onto the unit ball is definable in an o-minimal structure,
provided that at singular boundary points the angles of the boundary are
irrational multiples of $\pi$.
"
How can one calculate the b-quark running mass in supersymmetric QCD from the b-quark running mass in non-supersymmetric QCD?,"  The running mass of the b-quark defined in DRbar-scheme is one of the
important parameters of SUSY QCD. To find its value it should be related to
some known experimental input. In this paper the b-quark running mass defined
in nonsupersymmetric QCD is chosen for determination of corresponding parameter
in SUSY QCD. The relation between these two quantities is found by considering
five-flavor QCD as an effective theory obtained from its supersymmetric
extension. A numerical analysis of the calculated two-loop relation and its
impact on the MSSM spectrum is discussed. Since for nonsupersymmetric models
MSbar-scheme is more natural than DRbar, we also propose a new procedure that
allows one to calculate relations between MSbar- and DRbar-parameters.
Unphysical epsilon-scalars that give rise to the difference between mentioned
schemes are assumed to be heavy and decoupled in the same way as physical
degrees of freedom. By means of this method it is possible to ``catch two
rabbits'', i.e., decouple heavy particles and turn from DRbar to MSbar, at the
same time. Explicit two-loop example of DRbar -> MSbar transition is given in
the context of QCD. The advantages and disadvantages of the method are briefly
discussed.
"
What is the relationship between mosaics and Knutson-Tao puzzles?,"  We define mosaics, which are naturally in bijection with Knutson-Tao puzzles.
We define an operation on mosaics, which shows they are also in bijection with
Littlewood-Richardson skew-tableaux. Another consequence of this construction
is that we obtain bijective proofs of commutativity and associativity for the
ring structures defined either of these objects. In particular, we obtain a
new, easy proof of the Littlewood-Richardson rule. Finally we discuss how our
operation is related to other known constructions, particularly jeu de taquin.
"
What are the basic physics in solid materials that lead to high-temperature superconductivity in cuprates?,"  Since the cuprate materials behave many curious properties, the mechanism
that causes high-temperature superconductivity in copper oxide materials
(cuprates) has been a controversial topic. To explain these curious properties,
we must look out the physics what these materials include. In this letter, it
is presented that there are the basic physics (1)-(9) in solid materials. I
divide all solid materials into four categories, explain some properties of
them qualitatively, and suggest some ways to turn a solid material into a
superconductor. Particularly, this letter discusses the differences between the
p-type high-Tc cuprate superconductors, the n-type superconductor Nd2-xCexCuO4,
the BCS-superconductor similar MgB2, and heavy Fermions superconductors.
"
What is the threshold current for the switching of the polarity?,"  We study the dynamics of a vortex state nanodisk due to a dc spin current,
perpendicular to the disk plane. The irreversible switching of the vortex
polarity takes place above some threshold current. The detailed description of
these processes is obtained by spin-lattice simulations.
"
What are the properties of a system near a critical point that are evaluated by the algorithms presented in this paper?,"  We present a collection of algorithms which utilize dimensional reduction to
perform mesh refinement and study possibly singular solutions of time-dependent
partial differential equations. The algorithms are inspired by constructions
used in statistical mechanics to evaluate the properties of a system near a
critical point. The first algorithm allows the accurate determination of the
time of occurrence of a possible singularity. The second algorithm is an
adaptive mesh refinement scheme which can be used to approach efficiently the
possible singularity. Finally, the third algorithm uses the second algorithm
until the available resolution is exhausted (as we approach the possible
singularity) and then switches to a dimensionally reduced model which, when
accurate, can follow faithfully the solution beyond the time of occurrence of
the purported singularity. An accurate dimensionally reduced model should
dissipate energy at the right rate. We construct two variants of each
algorithm. The first variant assumes that we have actual knowledge of the
reduced model. The second variant assumes that we know the form of the reduced
model, i.e. the terms appearing in the reduced model, but not necessarily their
coefficients. In this case, we also provide a way of determining the
coefficients. We present numerical results for the Burgers equation with zero
and nonzero viscosity to illustrate the use of the algorithms.
"
What are the general conditions for the validity of the adiabatic approximation?,"  We examine the quantitative condition which has been widely used as a
criterion for the adiabatic approximation but was recently found insufficient.
Our results indicate that the usual quantitative condition is sufficient for a
special class of quantum mechanical systems. For general systems, it may not be
sufficient, but it along with additional conditions is sufficient. The usual
quantitative condition and the additional conditions constitute a general
criterion for the validity of the adiabatic approximation, which is applicable
to all $N-$dimensional quantum systems. Moreover, we illustrate the use of the
general quantitative criterion in some physical models.
"
What is the role of X-ray clusters in constraining cosmological parameters?,"  In the last eight years, the Chandra and XMM-Newton satellites changed
significantly our view of X-ray clusters of galaxies. In particular, several
complex phenomena have been directly observed: interactions between cluster
galaxies and the Intra Cluster Medium (ICM), cold fronts in the ICM, hot
bubbles due to relativistic jets from radio loud AGN, the lack of cold gas in
``cool-cores'', and non-thermal X-ray emission. Still, this increasing
complexity does not prevent us from using X-ray clusters as a tool to constrain
cosmological parameters. In addition, observations of clusters up to redshift
~1.3 allowed us to trace the thermodynamical and chemical evolution of the ICM
on a time interval as large as 8 Gyr. In this presentation, I will give a
personal introduction to the most debated topics in this field, to end with
some prospects for the next-generation X-ray satellites.
"
"What are the electronic, magnetic and orbital structures of KCrF3 in its different crystallographic phases?","  The electronic, magnetic and orbital structures of KCrF_3 are determined in
all its recently identified crystallographic phases (cubic, tetragonal, and
monoclinic) with a set of {\it ab initio} LSDA and LSDA+U calculations. The
high-temperature undistorted cubic phase is metallic within the LSDA, but at
the LSDA+U level it is a Mott insulator with a gap of 1.72 eV. The tetragonal
and monoclinic phases of KCrF_3 exhibit cooperative Jahn-Teller distortions
concomitant with staggered 3x^2-r^2/3y^2-r^2 orbital order. We find that the
energy gain due to the Jahn-Teller distortion is 82/104 meV per chromium ion in
the tetragonal/monoclinic phase, respectively. These phases show A-type
magnetic ordering and have a bandgap of 2.48 eV. In this Mott insulating state
KCrF_3 has a substantial conduction bandwidth of 2.1 eV, leading to the
possibility for the kinetic energy of charge carriers in electron- or
hole-doped derivatives of KCrF_3 to overcome the polaron localization at low
temperatures, in analogy with the situation encountered in the colossal
magnetoresistive manganites.
"
What are the implications of the proximity effect on the amplitude of current fluctuations and the weak localization correction to the average current?,"  We study mesoscopic fluctuations and weak localization correction to the
supercurrent in Josephson junctions with coherent diffusive electron dynamics
in the normal part. Two kinds of junctions are considered: a chaotic dot
coupled to superconductors by tunnel barriers and a diffusive junction with
transparent normal--superconducting interfaces. The amplitude of current
fluctuations and the weak localization correction to the average current are
calculated as functions of the ratio between the superconducting gap and the
electron dwell energy, temperature, and superconducting phase difference across
the junction. Technically, fluctuations on top of the spatially inhomogeneous
proximity effect in the normal region are described by the replicated version
of the \sigma-model. For the case of diffusive junctions with transparent
interfaces, the magnitude of mesoscopic fluctuations of the critical current
appears to be nearly 3 times larger than the prediction of the previous theory
which did not take the proximity effect into account.
"
What are the topological Q-vector spaces modelled on full subcategories of the derived category of R?,"  Let R be a commutative, noetherian, local ring. Topological Q-vector spaces
modelled on full subcategories of the derived category of R are constructed in
order to study intersection multiplicities.
"
What are the CKM matrix element Vcb by the experimental decay rate without model dependent extrapolations?,"  We calculate, in the continuum limit of quenched lattice QCD, the form factor
that enters in the decay rate of the semileptonic decay B --> D l nu. Making
use of the step scaling method (SSM), previously introduced to handle two scale
problems in lattice QCD, and of flavour twisted boundary conditions we extract
G(w) at finite momentum transfer and at the physical values of the heavy quark
masses. Our results can be used in order to extract the CKM matrix element Vcb
by the experimental decay rate without model dependent extrapolations.
"
What are the implications of a geometrically induced scalar potential on 4D hypersurfaces for a chaotic scenario?,"  Assuming the existence of a 5D purely kinetic scalar field on the class of
warped product spaces we investigate the possibility of mimic both an
inflationary and a quintessential scenarios on 4D hypersurfaces, by
implementing a dynamical foliation on the fifth coordinate instead of a
constant one. We obtain that an induced chaotic inflationary scenario with a
geometrically induced scalar potential and an induced quasi-vacuum equation of
state on 4D dynamical hypersurfaces is possible. While on a constant foliation
the universe can be considered as matter dominated today, in a family of 4D
dynamical hypersurfaces the universe can be passing for a period of accelerated
expansion with a deceleration parameter nearly -1. This effect of the dynamical
foliation results negligible at the inflationary epoch allowing for a chaotic
scenario and becomes considerable at the present epoch allowing a
quintessential scenario.
"
What is the shape of the radiation spectra produced by a relativistic particle in the presence of one-dimensional Langmuir turbulence?,"  We calculate spectra of radiation produced by a relativistic particle in the
presence of one-dimensional Langmuir turbulence which might be generated by a
streaming instability in the plasma, in particular, in the shock front or at
the shock-shock interactions. The shape of the radiation spectra is shown to
depend sensitively on the angle between the particle velocity and electric
field direction. The radiation spectrum in the case of exactly transverse
particle motion is degenerate and similar to that of spatially uniform Langmuir
oscillations. In case of oblique propagation, the spectrum is more complex, it
consists of a number of power-law regions and may contain a distinct
high-frequency spectral peak. %at $\omega=2\omega\pe \gamma^2$. The emission
process considered is relevant to various laboratory plasma settings and for
astrophysical objects as gamma-ray bursts and collimated jets.
"
What are the implications of the approach for the bosonic replicas in the beta=2 Dyson symmetry class?,"  Motivated by the ongoing discussion about a seeming asymmetry in the
performance of fermionic and bosonic replicas, we present an exact,
nonperturbative approach to zero-dimensional replica field theories belonging
to the broadly interpreted ""beta=2"" Dyson symmetry class. We then utilise the
formalism developed to demonstrate that the bosonic replicas do correctly
reproduce the microscopic spectral density in the QCD inspired chiral Gaussian
unitary ensemble. This disproves the myth that the bosonic replica field
theories are intrinsically faulty.
"
What are the implications of the Fermi-surface topologies of PrOs$_4$As$_{12}$ and LaOs$_4$As$_{12}$ in the PMM phase?,"  Comprehensive magnetic-field-orientation dependent studies of the
susceptibility and de Haas-van Alphen effect have been carried out on single
crystals of the filled skutterudites PrOs$_4$As$_{12}$ and LaOs$_4$As$_{12}$
using magnetic fields of up to 40~T. Several peaks are observed in the
low-field susceptibility of PrOs$_4$As$_{12}$, corresponding to cascades of
metamagnetic transitions separating the low-field antiferromagnetic and
high-field paramagnetic metal (PMM) phases. The de Haas-van Alphen experiments
show that the Fermi-surface topologies of PrOs$_4$As$_{12}$ in its PMM phase
and LaOs$_4$As$_{12}$ are very similar. In addition, they are in reasonable
agreement with the predictions of bandstructure calculations for
LaOs$_4$As$_{12}$ on the PrOs$_4$As$_{12}$ lattice. Both observations suggest
that the Pr 4$f$ electrons contribute little to the number of itinerant
quasiparticles in the PMM phase. However, whilst the properties of
LaOs$_4$As$_{12}$ suggest a conventional nonmagnetic Fermi liquid, the effects
of direct exchange and electron correlations are detected in the PMM phase of
PrOs$_4$As$_{12}$. For example, the quasiparticle effective masses in
PrOs$_4$As$_{12}$ are found to decrease with increasing field, probably
reflecting the gradual suppression of magnetic fluctuations associated with
proximity to the low-temperature, low-field antiferromagnetic state.

What is the effect of galaxy stellar mass on the clustering of galaxies at z~0.85?,"  Aims: We use the VVDS-Deep first-epoch data to measure the dependence of
galaxy clustering on galaxy stellar mass, at z~0.85.
  Methods: We measure the projected correlation function wp(rp) for sub-samples
with 0.5<z<1.2 covering different mass ranges between 10^9 and 10^11 Msun. We
quantify in detail the observational selection biases using 40 mock catalogues
built from the Millennium run and semi-analytic models.
  Results: Our simulations indicate that serious incompleteness in mass is
present only for log(M/Msun)<9.5. In the mass range log(M/Msun)=[9.0-9.5], the
photometric selection function of the VVDS misses 2/3rd of the galaxies. The
sample is virtually 100% complete above 10^10 Msun. We present the first direct
evidence for a clear dependence of clustering on the galaxy stellar mass at
z~0.85. The clustering length increases from r0 ~ 2.76 h^-1 Mpc for galaxies
with mass M>10^9 Msun to r0 ~ 4.28 h^-1 Mpc for galaxies more massive than
10^10.5 Msun. At the same time, the slope increases from ~ 1.67 to ~ 2.28.
  A comparison of the observed wp(rp) to local measurements by the SDSS shows
that the evolution is faster for objects less massive than ~10^10.5 Msun. This
is interpreted as a higher dependence on redshift of the linear bias b_L for
the more massive objects. While for the most massive galaxies b_L decreases
from 1.5+/-0.2 at z~0.85 to 1.33+/-0.03 at z~0.15, the less massive population
maintains a virtually constant value b_L~1.3. This result is in agreement with
a scenario in which more massive galaxies formed at high redshift in the
highest peaks of the density field, while less massive objects form at later
epochs from the more general population of dark-matter halos.
"
What is the luminosity of the AGN in M81 in terms of a steady state spherically symmetric inflow?,"  A new model is presented which explains the origin of the broad emission
lines observed in the LINER/Seyfert nucleus of M81 in terms of a steady state
spherically symmetric inflow, amounting to 1 x 10^-5 Msun/yr, which is
sufficient to explain the luminosity of the AGN. The emitting volume has an
outer radius of ~1 pc, making it the largest broad line region yet to be
measured, and it contains a total mass of ~ 5 x 10^-2 Msun of dense, ~ 10^8
cm^-3, ionized gas, leading to a very low filling factor of ~ 5 x 10^-9. The
fact that the BLR in M81 is so large may explain why the AGN is unable to
sustain the ionization seen there. Thus, the AGN in M81 is not simply a scaled
down quasar.
"
What are the implications of the NP-hardness of the problem of approximating the size of stopping and trapping sets in Tanner graphs of linear block codes?,"  We prove that approximating the size of stopping and trapping sets in Tanner
graphs of linear block codes, and more restrictively, the class of low-density
parity-check (LDPC) codes, is NP-hard. The ramifications of our findings are
that methods used for estimating the height of the error-floor of moderate- and
long-length LDPC codes based on stopping and trapping set enumeration cannot
provide accurate worst-case performance predictions.

What are the asymptotic scaling laws for the proposed schemes with different linear combining techniques?,"  Opportunistic scheduling and beamforming schemes are proposed for multiuser
MIMO-SDMA downlink systems with linear combining in this work. Signals received
from all antennas of each mobile terminal (MT) are linearly combined to improve
the {\em effective} signal-to-noise-interference ratios (SINRs). By exploiting
limited feedback on the effective SINRs, the base station (BS) schedules
simultaneous data transmission on multiple beams to the MTs with the largest
effective SINRs. Utilizing the extreme value theory, we derive the asymptotic
system throughputs and scaling laws for the proposed scheduling and beamforming
schemes with different linear combining techniques. Computer simulations
confirm that the proposed schemes can substantially improve the system
throughput.
"
What is the Monge-Ampere equation for measures with a large singular part?,"  In this article we solve the complex Monge-Ampere equation for measures with
large singular part. This result generalizes classical results by Demailly,
Lelong and Lempert a.o., who considered singular parts carried on discrete
sets. By using our result we obtain a generalization of Kolodziej's subsolution
theorem. More precisely, we prove that if a non-negative Borel measure is
dominated by a complex Monge-Ampere measure, then it is a complex Monge-Ampere
measure.
"
What are the implications of random walks of the holonomies of the gauge field for the Yang-Mills theories?,"  Dynamics of Wilson loops in pure Yang-Mills theories is analyzed in terms of
random walks of the holonomies of the gauge field on the gauge group manifold.
It is shown that such random walks should necessarily be free. The distribution
of steps of these random walks is related to the spectrum of string tensions of
the theory and to certain cumulants of Yang-Mills curvature tensor. It turns
out that when colour charges are completely screened, the holonomies of the
gauge field can change only by the elements of the group center, which
indicates that in the screening regime confinement persists due to thin center
vortices. Thick center vortices are also considered and the emergence of such
stepwise changes in the limits of infinitely thin vortices and infinitely large
loops is demonstrated.
"
What is the relationship between the time-dependent density functional calculations and the momentum space properties of a model atom?,"  We investigate the possibility to deduce momentum space properties from
time-dependent density functional calculations. Electron and ion momentum
distributions after double ionization of a model Helium atom in a strong
few-cycle laser pulse are studied. We show that, in this case, the choice of
suitable functionals for the observables is considerably more important than
the choice of the correlation potential in the time-dependent Kohn-Sham
equations. By comparison with the solution of the time-dependent Schroedinger
equation, the insufficiency of functionals neglecting electron correlation is
demonstrated. We construct a functional of the Kohn-Sham orbitals, which in
principle yields the exact momentum distributions of the electrons and the ion.
The product-phase approximation is introduced, which reduces the problem of
approximating this functional significantly.
"
What is the significance of identifying basaltic asteroids in the asteroid Main Belt?,"  The identification of basaltic asteroids in the asteroid Main Belt and the
description of their surface mineralogy is necessary to understand the
diversity in the collection of basaltic meteorites. Basaltic asteroids can be
identified from their visible reflectance spectra and are classified as V-type
in the usual taxonomies. In this work, we report visible spectroscopic
observations of two candidate V-type asteroids, (7472) Kumakiri and (10537)
1991 RY16, located in the outer Main Belt (a > 2.85 UA). These candidate have
been previously identified by Roig and Gil-Hutton (2006, Icarus 183, 411) using
the Sloan Digital Sky Survey colors. The spectroscopic observations have been
obtained at the Calar Alto Observatory, Spain, during observational runs in
November and December 2006. The spectra of these two asteroids show the steep
slope shortwards of 0.70 microns and the deep absorption feature longwards of
0.75 microns that are characteristic of V-type asteroids. However, the presence
of a shallow but conspicuous absorption band around 0.65 microns opens some
questions about the actual mineralogy of these two asteroids. Such band has
never been observed before in basaltic asteroids with the intensity we detected
it. We discuss the possibility for this shallow absorption feature to be caused
by the presence of chromium on the asteroid surface. Our results indicate that,
together with (1459) Magnya, asteroids (7472) Kumakiri and (10537) 1991 RY16
may be the only traces of basaltic material found up to now in the outer Main
Belt.
"
What are the symbolic calculus and algebra D used to formulate boundary value control problems?,"  The paper considers pseudo-differential boundary value control systems. The
underlying operators form an algebra D with the help of which we are able to
formulate typical boundary value control problems. The symbolic calculus gives
tools to form e.g. compositions, formal adjoints, generalized right or left
inverses and compatibility conditions. By a parametrizability we mean that for
a given control system Au=0 one finds an operator S such that Au=0 if and only
if u=Sf. The computation rules of D (or its appropriate subalgebra D')
guarantee that in many applications S can be refinely analyzed or even
explicitly calculated. We outline some methods of homological algebra for the
study of parametrization S. Especially the projectivity of a certain factor
module (defined by the system equations) implies the parametrizability. We give
some examples to illustrate our computational methods.
"
"What are the elementary properties of upper semilattices, lower semilattices, and lattices with implication-like operations?","  A sectionally pseudocomplemented poset P is one which has the top element and
in which every principal order filter is a pseudocomplemented poset. The
sectional pseudocomplements give rise to an implication-like operation on P
which coincides with the relative pseudocomplementation if P is relatively
psudocomplemented. We characterise this operation and study some elementary
properties of upper semilattices, lower semilattices and lattices equipped with
this kind of implication. We deal also with a few weaker versions of
implication. Sectionally pseudocomplemented lattices have already been studied
in the literature.
"
What is the X-ray continuum spectrum of radiation from the accretion disk in stellar-mass black holes in X-ray binaries?,"  We describe a program that we have embarked on to estimate the spins of
stellar-mass black holes in X-ray binaries. We fit the continuum X-ray spectrum
of the radiation from the accretion disk using the standard thin disk model,
and extract the dimensionless spin parameter a* = a/M of the black hole as a
parameter of the fit. We have obtained results on three systems, 4U 1543-47 (a*
= 0.7-0.85), GRO J1655-40 (0.65-0.8), and GRS 1915+105 (0.98-1), and have
nearly completed analysis of two additional systems. We anticipate expanding
the sample of spin estimates to about a dozen over the next several years.
"
What are the implications of the correlation between cosmic rays and global warming?,"  It has been claimed by others that observed temporal correlations of
terrestrial cloud cover with `the cosmic ray intensity' are causal. The
possibility arises, therefore, of a connection between cosmic rays and Global
Warming. If true, the implications would be very great. We have examined this
claim to look for evidence to corroborate it. So far we have not found any and
so our tentative conclusions are to doubt it. Such correlations as appear are
more likely to be due to the small variations in solar irradiance, which, of
course, correlate with cosmic rays. We estimate that less than 15% of the
11-year cycle warming variations are due to cosmic rays and less than 2% of the
warming over the last 35 years is due to this cause.
"
What are the assumptions of the Lagrangian BRST cohomology?,"  Consistent couplings between a massless tensor field with the mixed symmetry
of the Riemann tensor and a massless vector field are analyzed in the framework
of Lagrangian BRST cohomology. Under the assumptions on smoothness, locality,
Lorentz covariance, and Poincare invariance of the deformations, combined with
the requirement that the interacting Lagrangian is at most second-order
derivative, it is proved that there are no consistent cross-interactions
between a single massless tensor field with the mixed symmetry of the Riemann
tensor and one massless vector field.
"
What are the implications of the amplitude of scalar resonances in terms of the two-meson phases?,"  Scattering and production amplitudes involving scalar resonances are known,
according to Watson's theorem, to share the same phase $\delta(s)$. We show
that, at low energies, the production amplitude is fully determined by the
combination of $\delta(s)$ with another phase $\omega(s)$, which describes
intermediate two-meson propagation and is theoretically unambiguous. Our main
result is a simple and almost model independent expression, which generalizes
the usual $K$-matrix unitarization procedure and is suited to be used in
analyses of production data involving scalar resonances.
"
What is the compilation of radio frequency spectra from the literature for all sources within the VLSS?,"  As a service to the community, we have compiled radio frequency spectra from
the literature for all sources within the VLA Low Frequency Sky Survey (VLSS)
that are brighter than 15 Jy at 74 MHz. Over 160 references were used to
maximize the amount of spectral data used in the compilation of the spectra,
while also taking care to determine the corrections needed to put the flux
densities from all reference on the same absolute flux density scale. With the
new VLSS data, we are able to vastly improve upon previous efforts to compile
spectra of bright radio sources to frequencies below 100 MHz because (1) the
VLSS flux densities are more reliable than those from some previous low
frequency surveys and (2) the VLSS covers a much larger area of the sky
(declination >-30 deg.) than many other low frequency surveys (e.g., the 8C
survey). In this paper, we discuss how the spectra were constructed and how
parameters quantifying the shapes of the spectra were derived. Both the spectra
and the shape parameters are made available here to assist in the calibration
of observations made with current and future low frequency radio facilities.
"
How does the outflowing gas in Haro 11 affect the growth of the wind and the escape of Lyman continuum photons?,"  We have re-analyzed FUSE data and obtained new Chandra observations of Haro
11, a local (D_L=88 Mpc) UV luminous galaxy. Haro 11 has a similar far-UV
luminosity (10^10.3 L_\odot), UV surface brightness (10^9.4 L_\odot kpc^-2),
SFR, and metallicity to that observed in Lyman Break Galaxies (LBGs). We show
that Haro 11 has extended, soft thermal (kT~0.68 keV) X-ray emission with a
luminosity and size which scales with the physical properties (e.g. SFR,
stellar mass) of the host galaxy. An enhanced alpha/Fe, ratio of ~4 relative to
solar abundance suggests significant supernovae enrichment. These results are
consistent with the X-ray emission being produced in a shock between a
supernovae driven outflow and the ambient material. The FUV spectra show strong
absorption lines similar to those observed in LBG spectra. A blueshifted
absorption component is identified as a wind outflowing at ~200-280 km/s.
OVI\lambda\lambda1032,1038 emission, the dominant cooling mechanism for coronal
gas at T~10^5.5 K is also observed. If associated with the outflow, the
luminosity of the OVI emission suggests that <20% of the total mechanical
energy from the supernovae and solar winds is being radiated away. This implies
that radiative cooling through OVI is not significantly inhibiting the growth
of the outflowing gas. In contradiction to the findings of Bergvall et al 2006,
we find no convincing evidence of Lyman continuum leakage in Haro 11. We
conclude that the wind has not created a `tunnel' allowing the escape of a
significant fraction of Lyman continuum photons and place a limit on the escape
fraction of f_{esc}<2%. Overall, both Haro 11 and a previously observed LBG
analogue VV 114, provide an invaluable insight into the X-ray and FUV
properties of high redshift LBGs.
"
What is the impact of the new understanding of space and time in physics?,"  Physics was in crisis at the beginning of the twentieth century because the
newborn Maxwell's electromagnetism defied mechanistic preconceptions. Albert
Einstein understood that the solution to the crisis required an audacious
reworking of the concepts of space and time. Special Relativity deeply modified
our way of regarding space and time, in order to harmonize electromagnetism
with the principle of relativity. As a consequence, lengths and elapsed times
were stripped of the invariant character that classical Physics conferred them;
in their place, the speed of light acquired that privileged status. Such
revolutionary change forced Einstein to reformulate Newtonian mechanics, a step
that led him to discover the mass-energy equivalence.
"
What is the relationship between the continuum and the spin boundary condition for a ferromagnet with finite size?,"  We prove that there is a compact separable continuum that (consistently) is
not a remainder of the real line.
"
What is the norm inequality on a Pseudo-hermitian manifold?,"  We find sharp bounds for the norm inequality on a Pseudo-hermitian manifold,
where the L^2 norm of all second derivatives of the function involving
horizontal derivatives is controlled by the L^2 norm of the sub-Laplacian.
Perturbation allows us to get a-priori bounds for solutions to sub-elliptic PDE
in non-divergence form with bounded measurable coefficients. The method of
proof is through a Bochner technique. The Heisenberg group is seen to be en
extremal manifold for our inequality in the class of manifolds whose Ricci
curvature is non-negative.
"
What is the result of the Kaluza-Klein states in the low-energy gauge group?,"  We include fermions to the model proposed in hep-th/0606021, and obtain a
renormalizable 4-dimensional SU(N) gauge theory which spontaneously generates
fuzzy extra dimensions and behaves like Yang-Mills theory on M^4 \times S^2. We
find a truncated tower of fermionic Kaluza-Klein states transforming under the
low-energy gauge group, which is found to be either SU(n), or SU(n_1) x SU(n_2)
x U(1). The latter case implies a nontrivial U(1) flux on S^2, leading to
would-be zero modes for the bifundamental fermions. In the non-chiral case they
may pair up to acquire a mass, and the emerging picture is that of mirror
fermions. We discuss the possible implementation of a chirality constraint in 6
dimensions, which is nontrivial at the quantum level due to the fuzzy nature of
the extra dimensions.
"
What is the behavior of random walks in the presence of barriers in a percolation network?,"  We present a model for diffusion in a molecularly crowded environment. The
model consists of random barriers in percolation network. Random walks in the
presence of slowly moving barriers show normal diffusion for long times, but
anomalous diffusion at intermediate times. The effective exponents for square
distance versus time usually are below one at these intermediate times, but can
be also larger than one for high barrier concentrations. Thus we observe sub-
as well as super-diffusion in a crowded environment.
"
What are the Artin L-functions for a class of quasi-cyclotomic fields?,"  We determine all irreducible representations of primary quasi-cyclotomic
fields in this paper. The methods can be applied to determine the irreducible
representations of any quasi-cyclotomic field. We also compute the Artin
L-functions for a class of quasi-cyclotomic fields.
"
What is the Lippmann-Schwinger equation used to derive the NN potential?,"  The leading-order nucleon-nucleon (NN) potential derived from chiral
perturbation theory consists of one-pion exchange plus a short-distance contact
interaction. We show that in the 1S0 and 3S1-3D1 channels renormalization of
the Lippmann-Schwinger equation for this potential can be achieved by
performing one subtraction. This subtraction requires as its only input
knowledge of the NN scattering lengths. This procedure leads to a set of
integral equations for the partial-wave NN t-matrix which give
cutoff-independent results for the corresponding NN phase shifts. This
reformulation of the NN scattering equation offers practical advantages,
because only observable quantities appear in the integral equation. The
scattering equation may then be analytically continued to negative energies,
where information on bound-state energies and wave functions can be extracted.
"
What is the growth mechanism of nanocrystals in ZnO?,"  We investigate the mechanism of growth of nanocrystals from solution using
the case of ZnO. Spanning a wide range of values of the parameters, such as the
temperature and the reactant concentration, that control the growth, our
results establish a qualitative departure from the widely accepted diffusion
controlled coarsening (Ostwald ripening) process quantified in terms of the
Lifshitz-Slyozov-Wagner theory. Further, we show that these experimental
observations can be qualitatively and quantitatively understood within a growth
mechanism that is intermediate between the two well-defined limits of diffusion
control and kinetic control.
"
What is the mechanism of generating the curvature perturbation in the multi-field model different from the conventional trapped inflationary scenario?,"  We consider inhomogeneous preheating in a multi-field trapping model. The
curvature perturbation is generated by inhomogeneous preheating which induces
multi-field trapping at the enhanced symmetric point (ESP), and results in
fluctuation in the number of e-foldings. Instead of considering simple
reheating after preheating, we consider a scenario of shoulder inflation
induced by the trapping. The fluctuation in the number of e-foldings is
generated during this weak inflationary period, when the additional light
scalar field is trapped at the local maximum of its potential. The situation
may look similar to locked or thermal inflation or even to hybrid inflation,
but we will show that the present mechanism of generating the curvature
perturbation is very different from these others. Unlike the conventional
trapped inflationary scenario, we do not make the assumption that an ESP
appears at some unstable point on the inflaton potential. This assumption is
crucial in the original scenario, but it is not important in the multi-field
model. We also discuss inhomogeneous preheating at late-time oscillation, in
which the magnitude of the curvature fluctuation can be enhanced to accommodate
low inflationary scale.
"
What is the Cauchy problem for a system of two coupled nonlinear Schrödinger equations in nonlinear optics?,"  We study the Cauchy problem for a system of two coupled nonlinear focusing
Schroedinger equations arising in nonlinear optics. We discuss when the
solutions are global in time or blow-up in finite time. Some results, in
dependence of the data of the problem, are proved; in particular we give a
bound, depending on the coupling parameter, for the blow-up threshold.
"
What are the linewidth of the detected resonances?,"  The absolute frequencies of the hyperfine components of the R(26) 62-0
transition in molecular iodine at 501.7 nm are measured for the first time with
an optical clockwork based on a femtosecond laser frequency comb generator. The
set-up is composed of an Ar+ laser locked to a hyperfine component of the R(26)
62-0 transition detected in a continuously pumped low-pressure cell (0.33 Pa).
The detected resonances show a linewidth of 45 kHz (half-width at
half-maximum). The uncertainty of the frequency measurement is estimated to be
250 Hz.
"
"What are the necessary and sufficient conditions for the bi-Legendrian connection ∇ associated to a bi-Legendrian structure (F,G) on a metric manifold (M,φ,ξ,η,g)?","  We find necessary and sufficient conditions for the bi-Legendrian connection
$\nabla$ associated to a bi-Legendrian structure $(\cal F,\cal G)$ on a contact
metric manifold $(M,\phi,\xi,\eta,g)$ being a metric connection and then we
give conditions ensuring that $\nabla$ coincides with the (generalized)
Tanaka-Webster connection of $(M,\phi,\xi,\eta,g)$. Using these results, we
give some interpretations of the Tanaka-Webster connection and we study the
interactions between the Tanaka-Webster, the bi-Legendrian and the Levi Civita
connection in a Sasakian manifold.
"
What is the principle of phase and amplitude coupling in beam splitters-combiners?,"  We derive generic phase and amplitude coupling relations for beam
splitters-combiners that couple a single port with three output ports or input
ports, respectively. We apply the coupling relations to a reflection grating
that serves as a coupler to a single-ended Fabry-Perot ring cavity. In the
impedance-matched case such an interferometer can act as an all-reflective ring
mode cleaner. It is further shown that in the highly undercoupled case almost
complete separation of carrier power and phase signal from a cavity strain can
be achieved.
"
What are the consequences of expressing the Tracy-Widom distribution functions in terms of integrals starting from minus infinity?,"  The Tracy-Widom distribution functions involve integrals of a Painlev\'e II
function starting from positive infinity. In this paper, we express the
Tracy-Widom distribution functions in terms of integrals starting from minus
infinity. There are two consequences of these new representations. The first is
the evaluation of the total integral of the Hastings-McLeod solution of the
Painlev\'e II equation. The second is the evaluation of the constant term of
the asymptotic expansions of the Tracy-Widom distribution functions as the
distribution parameter approaches minus infinity. For the GUE Tracy-Widom
distribution function, this gives an alternative proof of the recent work of
Deift, Its, and Krasovsky. The constant terms for the GOE and GSE Tracy-Widom
distribution functions are new.
"
What are the conditions for a small error in the procedure?,"  The accuracy of the procedure that converts the experimentally determined
electron spectrum associated with fission of the nuclear fuels ^{235}U,
^{239}Pu, ^{241}Pu, and ^{238}U into the $\bar{\nu}_e$ spectrum is examined. By
using calculated sets of mutually consistent spectra it is shown that the
conversion procedure can result in a small $\sim$1% error provided several
conditions are met. Chief among them are the requirements that the average
nuclear charge <Z> as a function of the $\beta$ decay endpoint energy is
independently known and that the $\bar{\nu}_e$ spectrum is binned into bins
that are several times larger than the width of the slices used to fit the
electron spectrum.
"
What is the relationship between the thermodynamic and microscopic arguments?,"  We discuss the conditions for which the non-equilibrium work relation is
valid by means of thermodynamic and microscopic arguments.
"
What is the relationship between the spin helicity and the direction of the spontaneous electric polarization in CuFe1-xAlxO2?,"  Multiferroic CuFe1-xAlxO2 (x=0.02) exhibits a ferroelectric ordering
accompanied by a proper helical magnetic ordering below T=7K under zero
magnetic field. By polarized neutron diffraction and pyroelectric measurements,
we have revealed a one-to-one correspondence between the spin helicity and the
direction of the spontaneous electric polarization. This result indicates that
the spin helicity of the proper helical magnetic ordering is essential for the
ferroelectricity in CuFe1-xAlxO2. The induction of the electric polarization by
the proper helical magnetic ordering is, however, cannot be explained by the
Katsura-Nagaosa-Balatsky model, which successfully explains the
ferroelectricity in the recently explored ferroelectric helimagnets, such as
TbMnO3. We thus conclude that CuFe1-xAlxO2 is a new class of magnetic
ferroelectrics.
"
"What is the proposed quantum hologram for light memory, and what are its features?","  Matter-light quantum interface and quantum memory for light are important
ingredients of quantum information protocols, such as quantum networks,
distributed quantum computation, etc. In this Letter we present a spatially
multimode scheme for quantum memory for light, which we call a quantum
hologram. Our approach uses a multi-atom ensemble which has been shown to be
efficient for a single spatial mode quantum memory. Due to the multi-atom
nature of the ensemble it is capable of storing many spatial modes, a feature
critical for the present proposal. A quantum hologram has a higher storage
capacity compared to a classical hologram, and is capable of storing quantum
features of an image, such as multimode superposition and entangled quantum
states, something that a standard hologram is unable to achieve. Due to optical
parallelism, the information capacity of the quantum hologram will obviously
exceed that of a single-mode scheme.
"
"What is the new approach to power control in decentralized wireless networks, termed fractional power control (FPC)?","  We consider a new approach to power control in decentralized wireless
networks, termed fractional power control (FPC). Transmission power is chosen
as the current channel quality raised to an exponent -s, where s is a constant
between 0 and 1. The choices s = 1 and s = 0 correspond to the familiar cases
of channel inversion and constant power transmission, respectively. Choosing s
in (0,1) allows all intermediate policies between these two extremes to be
evaluated, and we see that usually neither extreme is ideal. We derive
closed-form approximations for the outage probability relative to a target SINR
in a decentralized (ad hoc or unlicensed) network as well as for the resulting
transmission capacity, which is the number of users/m^2 that can achieve this
SINR on average. Using these approximations, which are quite accurate over
typical system parameter values, we prove that using an exponent of 1/2
minimizes the outage probability, meaning that the inverse square root of the
channel strength is a sensible transmit power scaling for networks with a
relatively low density of interferers. We also show numerically that this
choice of s is robust to a wide range of variations in the network parameters.
Intuitively, s=1/2 balances between helping disadvantaged users while making
sure they do not flood the network with interference.
"
What are the main elements of the quantum geometry at the Planck scale?,"  In any attempt to build a quantum theory of gravity, a central issue is to
unravel the structure of space-time at the smallest scale. Of particular
relevance is the possible definition of coordinate functions within the theory
and the study of their algebraic properties, such as non-commutativity. Here we
approach this issue from the perspective of loop quantum gravity and the
picture of quantum geometry that the formalism offers. In particular, as we
argue here, this emerging picture has two main elements: i) The nature of the
quantum geometry at Planck scale is one-dimensional, polymeric with quantized
geometrical quantities and; ii) Appropriately defined operators corresponding
to coordinates by means of intrinsic, relational, constructions become
non-commuting. This particular feature of the operators, that operationally
localize points on space, gives rise to an emerging geometry that is also, in a
precise sense, fuzzy.
"
What is the mixed supersymmetric-algebraic approach to construction of the minimum uncertainty of anharmonic oscillators?,"  A mixed supersymmetric-algebraic approach to construction of the minimum
uncertainty coherent states of anharmonic oscillators is presented. It permits
generating not only the well-known coherent states of the harmonic and Morse
oscillators but also the so far unknown coherent states of the Wei Hua,
Kratzer-Fues and generalized Morse and Kratzer-Fues oscillators. The method can
be applied also to generate superpotentials indispensable for deriving the
Schr\""odinger equation in the supersymmetric form amenable to direct solution
in the SUSYQM scheme.
"
What are the key contributions of one-loop fluctuations determinants at the boundary of the total space?,"  We study cohomological gauge theories on total spaces of holomorphic line
bundles over complex manifolds and obtain their reduction to the base manifold
by U(1) equivariant localization of the path integral. We exemplify this
general mechanism by proving via exact path integral localization a reduction
for local curves conjectured in hep-th/0411280, relevant to the calculation of
black hole entropy/Gromov-Witten invariants. Agreement with the
four-dimensional gauge theory is recovered by taking into account in the latter
non-trivial contributions coming from one-loop fluctuations determinants at the
boundary of the total space. We also study a class of abelian gauge theories on
Calabi-Yau local surfaces, describing the quantum foam for the A-model,
relevant to the calculation of Donaldson-Thomas invariants.
"
What are the key concepts of model categories for double categories?,"  We introduce a new categorical framework for studying derived functors, and
in particular for comparing composites of left and right derived functors. Our
central observation is that model categories are the objects of a double
category whose vertical and horizontal arrows are left and right Quillen
functors, respectively, and that passage to derived functors is functorial at
the level of this double category. The theory of conjunctions and mates in
double categories, which generalizes the theory of adjunctions and mates in
2-categories, then gives us canonical ways to compare composites of left and
right derived functors. We give a number of sample applications, most of which
are improvements of existing proofs in the literature.
"
What is the relationship between the lattice-scale physics and the subtler lattice-scale physics in graphene?,"  Graphene's honeycomb lattice structure underlies much of the remarkable
physics inherent in this material, most strikingly through the formation of two
``flavors'' of Dirac cones for each spin. In the quantum Hall regime, the
resulting flavor degree of freedom leads to an interesting problem when a
Landau level is partially occupied. Namely, while Zeeman splitting clearly
favors polarizing spins along the field, precisely how the states for each
flavor are occupied can become quite delicate. Here we focus on clean graphene
sheets in the regime of quantum Hall ferromagnetism, and discuss how subtler
lattice-scale physics, arising either from interactions or disorder, resolves
this ambiguity to measurable consequence. Interestingly, such lattice-scale
physics favors microscopic symmetry-breaking order coexisting with the usual
liquid-like quantum Hall physics emerging on long length scales. The current
experimental situation is briefly reviewed in light of our discussion.

What are the general relativistic static perfect fluid spheres in different coordinate systems?,"  In two previous articles [Phys. Rev. D71 (2005) 124307 (gr-qc/0503007), and
gr-qc/0607001] we have discussed several ""algorithmic"" techniques that permit
one (in a purely mechanical way) to generate large classes of general
relativistic static perfect fluid spheres. Working in Schwarzschild curvature
coordinates, we used these algorithmic ideas to prove several
""solution-generating theorems"" of varying levels of complexity. In the present
article we consider the situation in other coordinate systems: In particular,
in general diagonal coordinates we shall generalize our previous theorems, in
isotropic coordinates we shall encounter a variant of the so-called ""Buchdahl
transformation"", while in other coordinate systems (such as Gaussian polar
coordinates, Synge isothermal coordinates, and Buchdahl coordinates) we shall
find a number of more complex ""Buchdahl-like transformations"" and
""solution-generating theorems"" that may be used to investigate and classify the
general relativistic static perfect fluid sphere. Finally by returning to
general diagonal coordinates and making a suitable ansatz for the functional
form of the metric components we place the Buchdahl transformation in its most
general possible setting.
"
What are the preliminary results of the $B^-\to D^{*0} e^-\bar\nu_e$ decay study?,"  Using 226 million $B\bar{B}$ events recorded on the $\Upsilon(4S)$ resonance
with the BABAR detector at the SLAC $e^+e^-$ storage rings PEPII, we
reconstruct $B^-\to D^{*0} e^-\bar\nu_e$ decays using the decay chain
$D^{*0}\to{}D^0{}\pi^0$ and $D^{0}\to{}K^-\pi^+$. From the dependence of their
differential rate on $w$, the product of the four-velocities of $B^-${} and
$D^{*0}$, and using the description of the form factor $F(w)$ by Caprini et
al., we obtain the preliminary results $\rho^2_{A_1} = 1.15\pm 0.06 \pm 0.08$,
$F(1)\cdot|V_{cb}| = (36.3\pm 0.6 \pm 1.4)\cdot 10^{-3}$, and ${\cal B}(B^-\to
D^{*0} e^-\bar\nu_e) = (5.71\pm 0.08\pm 0.41)%$. The first errors are
statistical and the second ones are systematic. \\
"
What is the asymptotic form of the fracture toughness near high symmetry grain boundaries?,"  Cohesive laws are stress-strain curves used in finite element calculations to
describe the debonding of interfaces such as grain boundaries. It would be
convenient to describe grain boundary cohesive laws as a function of the
parameters needed to describe the grain boundary geometry; two parameters in 2D
and 5 parameters in 3D. However, we find that the cohesive law is not a smooth
function of these parameters. In fact, it is discontinuous at geometries for
which the two grains have repeat distances that are rational with respect to
one another. Using atomistic simulations, we extract grain boundary energies
and cohesive laws of grain boundary fracture in 2D with a Lennard-Jones
potential for all possible geometries which can be simulated within periodic
boundary conditions with a maximum box size. We introduce a model where grain
boundaries are represented as high symmetry boundaries decorated by extra
dislocations. Using it, we develop a functional form for the symmetric grain
boundary energies, which have cusps at all high symmetry angles. We also find
the asymptotic form of the fracture toughness near the discontinuities at high
symmetry grain boundaries using our dislocation decoration model.
"
What is the relationship between the density dependence of the chameleon mass and the thin shell effect?,"  We review some of the properties of chameleon theories. Chameleon fields are
gravitationally coupled to matter and evade gravitational tests thanks to two
fundamental properties. The first one is the density dependence of the
chameleon mass. In most cases, in a dense environment, chameleons are massive
enough to induce a short ranged fifth force. In other cases, non-linear effects
imply the existence of a thin shell effect shielding compact bodies from each
other and leading to an irrelevant fifth force. We also mention how a natural
extension of chameleon theories can play a role to solve the PVLAS versus CAST
discrepancy.
"
What are the v1-periodic homotopy groups of the Dwyer-Wilkerson space DI(4)?,"  The Dwyer-Wilkerson space DI(4) is the only exotic 2-compact group. We
compute its v1-periodic homotopy groups.
"
How does the WIde-field Nearby Galaxy-cluster Survey (WINGS) contribute to the study of galaxy populations in clusters?,"  [Abridged] The WIde-field Nearby Galaxy-cluster Survey (WINGS) is a project
aiming at the study of the galaxy populations in clusters in the local universe
(0.04<z<0.07) and the influence of environment on the physical properties of
galaxies. This survey provides a high quality set of spectroscopic data for
~6000 galaxies in 48 clusters. A salient feature of this model is the
possibility of treating dust extinction as a function of age, allowing younger
stars to be more obscured than older ones. Our technique, for the first time,
takes into account this feature in a spectral fitting code. A set of template
spectra spanning a wide range of star formation histories is built, with
features closely resembling those of typical spectra in our sample in terms of
spectral resolution, noise and wavelength coverage. Our method of analyzing
these spectra allows us to test the reliability and the uncertainties related
to each physical parameter we are inferring. The well-known degeneracy problem,
i.e. the non-uniqueness of the best fit solution (mass and extinction in
different age bins), can be addressed by assigning adequate error bars to the
recovered parameters. The values found in this way, together with their error
bars, identify the region of parameter space which contains all the possible
solutions for a given spectrum. A comparison test was also performed on a WINGS
subsample, containing objects in common with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey,
yielding excellent agreement. We find that the stellar content as a function of
age is reliably recovered in four main age bins and that the uncertainties only
mildly depend on the S/N ratio. The metallicity of the dominant stellar
population is not always recoverable unambiguosly, depending on the Star
Formation History pattern.
"
What are the geometric examples of N-differential graded algebras?,"  Deformations of the 3-differential of 3-differential graded algebras are
controlled by the (3,N) Maurer-Cartan equation. We find explicit formulae for
the coefficients appearing in that equation, introduce new geometric examples
of N-differential graded algebras, and use these results to study N Lie
algebroids.
"
What is the role of magnetoelectric coupling effects in the spin-flop helical phase in CuFeO2?,"  Biquadratic {\it antisymmetric} exchange terms of the form $ - [C_{ij}
e^{\alpha}_{ij}({\bf s}_i\times{\bf s}_j)_z]^2$, where ${\bf e}_{ij}$ is the
unit vector connecting sites $i$ and $j$ and $\alpha = x,y$, due partially to
magnetoelectric coupling effects, are shown to be responsible for the spin-flop
helical phase in CuFeO$_2$ at low magnetic field and temperature. Usual
biquadratic {\it symmetric} exchange, likely due to magnetoelastic coupling, is
found to support the stability of axial magnetic states at higher fields in
this nearly-Heisenberg like stacked triangular antiferromagnet. A model
Hamiltonian which also includes substantial interplane and higher-neighbor
intraplane exchange interactions, reproduces the unique series of observed
commensurate and incommensurate periodicity phases with increasing applied
magnetic field in this highly frustrated system. The magnetic field-temperature
phase diagram is discussed in terms of a Landau-type free energy.
"
What are the actors in the organization with the highest centrality in the generation of discussion groups?,"  Actual organizations, in particular the ones which operate in evolving and
distributed environments, need advanced frameworks for the management of the
knowledge life cycle. These systems have to be based on the social relations
which constitute the pattern of collaboration ties of the organization. We
demonstrate here, with the aid of a model taken from the theory of graphs, that
it is possible to provide the conditions for an effective knowledge management.
A right way could be to involve the actors with the highest betweeness
centrality in the generation of discussion groups. This solution allows the
externalization of tacit knowledge, the preservation of knowledge and the raise
of innovation processes.
"
What are the different limits of a centered and renormalized random field depending on the relative speed of $\lambda$ and $\rho$?,"  This paper studies the limits of a spatial random field generated by
uniformly scattered random sets, as the density $\lambda$ of the sets grows to
infinity and the mean volume $\rho$ of the sets tends to zero. Assuming that
the volume distribution has a regularly varying tail with infinite variance, we
show that the centered and renormalized random field can have three different
limits, depending on the relative speed at which $\lambda$ and $\rho$ are
scaled. If $\lambda$ grows much faster than $\rho$ shrinks, the limit is
Gaussian with long-range dependence, while in the opposite case, the limit is
independently scattered with infinite second moments. In a special intermediate
scaling regime, there exists a nontrivial limiting random field that is not
stable.
"
What is the oxygen abundance of the blue compact dwarf galaxy SDSSJ0956+2849=DDO 68?,"  We present 6.5-meter MMT spectrophotometry of 20 H II regions in 13 extremely
metal-poor emission-line galaxies selected from the Data Release 5 of the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey to have [O III] 4959/Hbeta < 1 and [N II] 6583/Hbeta < 0.05.
The electron temperature-sensitive emission line [O III] 4363 is detected in 13
H II regions allowing a direct abundance determination. The oxygen abundance in
the remaining H II regions is derived using a semi-empirical method. The oxygen
abundance of the galaxies in our sample ranges from 12+logO/H ~ 7.1 to ~ 7.8,
with 10 H II regions having an oxygen abundance lower than 7.5. The lowest
oxygen abundances, 12+logO/H = 7.14+/-0.03 and 7.13+/-0.07, are found in two H
II regions of the blue compact dwarf galaxy SDSSJ0956+2849=DDO 68, making it
the second most-metal deficient emission-line galaxy known, after SBS
0335-052W.
"
What are the six conjectures on pairs of consecutive primes?,"  Six conjectures on pairs of consecutive primes are listed in this paper,
together with examples for each case.
"
"What is the kinematic structure of star-forming galaxies at redshift z ~ 2-3, and what can be learned from the kinematic maps of these galaxies?","  We present early results from an ongoing study of the kinematic structure of
star-forming galaxies at redshift z ~ 2 - 3 using integral-field spectroscopy
of rest-frame optical nebular emission lines in combination with Keck laser
guide star adaptive optics (LGSAO). We show kinematic maps of 3 target galaxies
Q1623-BX453, Q0449-BX93, and DSF2237a-C2 located at redshifts z = 2.1820,
2.0067, and 3.3172 respectively, each of which is well-resolved with a PSF
measuring approximately 0.11 - 0.15 arcsec (~ 900 - 1200 pc at z ~ 2-3) after
cosmetic smoothing. Neither galaxy at z ~ 2 exhibits substantial kinematic
structure on scales >~ 30 km/s; both are instead consistent with largely
dispersion-dominated velocity fields with sigma ~ 80 km/s along any given line
of sight into the galaxy. In contrast, DSF2237a-C2 presents a well-resolved
gradient in velocity over a distance of ~ 4 kpc with peak-to-peak amplitude of
140 km/s. It is unlikely that DSF2237a-C2 represents a dynamically cold
rotating disk of ionized gas as the local velocity dispersion of the galaxy
(sigma = 79 km/s) is comparable to the observed shear. Using extant
multi-wavelength spectroscopy and photometry we relate these kinematic data to
physical properties such as stellar mass, gas fraction, star formation rate,
and outflow kinematics and consider the applicability of current galaxy
formation models.[Abridged]
"
What is the method of determining effective conservative interactions in coarse-grained particle-based mesoscopic simulations?,"  There exist methods for determining effective conservative interactions in
coarse grained particle based mesoscopic simulations. The resulting models can
be used to capture thermal equilibrium behavior, but in the model system we
study do not correctly represent transport properties. In this article we
suggest the use of force covariance to determine the full functional form of
dissipative and stochastic interactions. We show that a combination of the
radial distribution function and a force covariance function can be used to
determine all interactions in dissipative particle dynamics. Furthermore we use
the method to test if the effective interactions in dissipative particle
dynamics (DPD) can be adjusted to produce a force covariance consistent with a
projection of a microscopic Lennard-Jones simulation. The results indicate that
the DPD ansatz may not be consistent with the underlying microscopic dynamics.
We discuss how this result relates to theoretical studies reported in the
literature.
"
What is the structure of a graphene bilayer with a large separation?,"  We show that two graphene layers stacked directly on top of each other (AA
stacking) form strong chemical bonds when the distance between planes is 0.156
nm. Simultaneously, C-C in-plane bonds are considerably weakened from partial
double-bond (0.141 nm) to single bond (0.154 nm). This polymorphic form of
graphene bilayer is meta-stable w.r.t. the one bound by van der Waals forces at
a larger separation (0.335 nm) with an activation energy of 0.16 eV/cell.
Similarly to the structure found in hexaprismane, C forms four single bonds in
a geometry mixing 90^{0} and 120^{0} angles. Intermediate separations between
layers can be stabilized under external anisotropic stresses showing a rich
electronic structure changing from semimetal at van der Waals distance, to
metal when compressed, to wide gap semiconductor at the meta-stable minimum.
"
What are the selection rules for the spin-triplet character of the O2 molecule?,"  The measured low initial sticking probability of oxygen molecules at the
Al(111) surface that had puzzled the field for many years was recently
explained in a non-adiabatic picture invoking spin-selection rules [J. Behler
et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 94, 036104 (2005)]. These selection rules tend to
conserve the initial spin-triplet character of the free O2 molecule during the
molecule's approach to the surface. A new locally-constrained
density-functional theory approach gave access to the corresponding
potential-energy surface (PES) seen by such an impinging spin-triplet molecule
and indicated barriers to dissociation which reduce the sticking probability.
Here, we further substantiate this non-adiabatic picture by providing a
detailed account of the employed approach. Building on the previous work, we
focus in particular on inaccuracies in present-day exchange-correlation
functionals. Our analysis shows that small quantitative differences in the
spin-triplet constrained PES obtained with different gradient-corrected
functionals have a noticeable effect on the lowest kinetic energy part of the
resulting sticking curve.
"
What are the implications of Novikov algebras for Lie algebras?,"  We study ideals of Novikov algebras and Novikov structures on
finite-dimensional Lie algebras. We present the first example of a three-step
nilpotent Lie algebra which does not admit a Novikov structure. On the other
hand we show that any free three-step nilpotent Lie algebra admits a Novikov
structure. We study the existence question also for Lie algebras of triangular
matrices. Finally we show that there are families of Lie algebras of arbitrary
high solvability class which admit Novikov structures.
"
What are the effects of the Zeeman coupling in the Hubbard model?,"  I consider the Hubbard model of graphene in an external magnetic field and in
the Hartree-Fock approximation. In the continuum limit, the ground state energy
at half filling becomes nearly symmetric under rotations of the three-component
vector (N1,N2,m), with the first two components representing the Neel order
parameter orthogonal to and the third component the magnetization parallel with
the external magnetic field. When the symmetry breaking effects arising from
the lattice, Zeeman coupling, and higher Landau levels are included the system
develops a quantum critical point at which the antiferromagnetic order
disappears and the magnetization has a kink. The observed incompressible state
at filling factor one is argued to arise due to a finite third component of the
Neel order parameter at these electron densities. Recent experiments appear
consistent with vanishing N1 and N2, and finite N3, at the filling factors zero
and one, respectively.
"
What is the Ercolani-Sinha construction used to make effective charge 3 monopoles?,"  We develop the Ercolani-Sinha construction of SU(2) monopoles and make this
effective for (a five parameter family of centred) charge 3 monopoles. In
particular we show how to solve the transcendental constraints arising on the
spectral curve. For a class of symmetric curves the transcendental constraints
become a number theoretic problem and a recently proven identity of Ramanujan
provides a solution.
"
What is the expression for the distribution of the area swept out by a drifted Brownian motion till its first-passage time?,"  An exact expression for the distribution of the area swept out by a drifted
Brownian motion till its first-passage time is derived. A study of the
asymptotic behaviour confirms earlier conjectures and clarifies their range of
validity. The analysis also leads to a simple closed-form solution for the
moments of the Airy distribution.
"
"What are the contributions of Einstein, Sutherland, Smoluchowski, Bachelier, Perrin, and Langevin to the theory of Brownian motion?","  We describe in detail the history of Brownian motion, as well as the
contributions of Einstein, Sutherland, Smoluchowski, Bachelier, Perrin and
Langevin to its theory. The always topical importance in physics of the theory
of Brownian motion is illustrated by recent biophysical experiments, where it
serves, for instance, for the measurement of the pulling force on a single DNA
molecule.
  In a second part, we stress the mathematical importance of the theory of
Brownian motion, illustrated by two chosen examples. The by-now classic
representation of the Newtonian potential by Brownian motion is explained in an
elementary way. We conclude with the description of recent progress seen in the
geometry of the planar Brownian curve. At its heart lie the concepts of
conformal invariance and multifractality, associated with the potential theory
of the Brownian curve itself.
"
What is the significance of the IRAC data in understanding the interstellar dust in the Pleiades?,"  We make use of new near and mid-IR photometry of the Pleiades cluster in
order to help identify proposed cluster members. We also use the new photometry
with previously published photometry to define the single-star main sequence
locus at the age of the Pleiades in a variety of color-magnitude planes.
  The new near and mid-IR photometry extend effectively two magnitudes deeper
than the 2MASS All-Sky Point Source catalog, and hence allow us to select a new
set of candidate very low mass and sub-stellar mass members of the Pleiades in
the central square degree of the cluster. We identify 42 new candidate members
fainter than Ks =14 (corresponding to 0.1 Mo). These candidate members should
eventually allow a better estimate of the cluster mass function to be made down
to of order 0.04 solar masses.
  We also use new IRAC data, in particular the images obtained at 8 um, in
order to comment briefly on interstellar dust in and near the Pleiades. We
confirm, as expected, that -- with one exception -- a sample of low mass stars
recently identified as having 24 um excesses due to debris disks do not have
significant excesses at IRAC wavelengths. However, evidence is also presented
that several of the Pleiades high mass stars are found to be impacting with
local condensations of the molecular cloud that is passing through the Pleiades
at the current epoch.
"
What is the two-field model used to describe elasticity and lattice dynamics in graphene and carbon nanotubes?,"  A two-field model provides an unifying framework for elasticity, lattice
dynamics and electromechanical coupling in graphene and carbon nanotubes,
describes optical phonons, nontrivial acoustic branches, strain-induced gap
opening, gap-induced phonon softening, doping-induced deformations, and even
the hexagonal graphenic Brillouin zone, and thus explains and extends a
previously disparate accumulation of analytical and computational results.
"
What is the helioseismic holography used to compare observed travel times with expected travel times?,"  We perform helioseismic holography on realistic solar convection simulations
and compare the observed travel-time perturbations with the expected travel
times from the horizontal flows in the simulations computed from forward models
under the assumption of the Born approximation. We demonstrate reasonable
agreement between the observed and model travel times which reinforces the
validity of helioseismic holography in the detection of subsurface horizontal
flows. From the variation of the signal-to-noise ratio with depth, we conclude
that the helioseismic detection of individual flow structures with spatial
scales of supergranulation or smaller is not possible for depths below about 5
Mm below the surface over time scales less than a day. Approximately half of
the observed signal originates within the first 2 Mm below the surface. A
consequence of this is a rapid decrease (and reversal in some cases) of the
travel-time perturbations with depth due to the contribution to the
measurements of oppositely directed surface flows in neighboring convective
cells. This confirms an earlier interpretation of similar effects reported from
observations.
"
What is the relationship between the thickness of lipid membranes and the strength of the external electric field?,"  The behavior of lipid membranes in the presence of an external electric field
is studied and used to examine the influence of such fields on membrane
parameters such as roughness and show that for a micro sized membrane,
roughness grows as the field increases. The dependence of bending rigidity on
the electric field is also studied and an estimation of thickness of the
accumulated charges around lipid membranes in a free-salt solution is
presented.
"
What is the EM algorithm to treat arbitrarily censored or binned data?,"  We develop an active set algorithm for the maximum likelihood estimation of a
log-concave density based on complete data. Building on this fast algorithm, we
indidate an EM algorithm to treat arbitrarily censored or binned data.
"
What are the four-velocity and acceleration law in the weak field limit?,"  The equation of motion for test particles in $f(R)$ modified theories of
gravity is derived. By considering an explicit coupling between an arbitrary
function of the scalar curvature, $R$, and the Lagrangian density of matter, it
is shown that an extra force arises. This extra force is orthogonal to the
four-velocity and the corresponding acceleration law is obtained in the weak
field limit. Connections with MOND and with the Pioneer anomaly are further
discussed.
"
What are the implications of adaptive estimators in finance and technical applications?,"  Motivated by finance and technical applications, the objective of this paper
is to consider adaptive estimation of regression and density distribution based
on Fourier-Legendre expansion, and construction of confidence intervals - also
adaptive. The estimators are asymptotically optimal and adaptive in the sense
that they can adapt to unknown smoothness.
"
What are the axisymmetric Miyamoto and Nagai models of galaxies?,"  We present two triaxial analytical potential-density pairs that can be viewed
as generalized versions of the axisymmetric Miyamoto and Nagai and Satoh
galactic models. These potential-density pairs may be useful models for
galaxies with box-shaped bulges. The resulting mass density distributions are
everywhere non-negative and free from singularities. Also, a few numerically
calculated orbits for the Miyamoto and Nagai-like triaxial potential are
presented.
"
What is the quantum model in Hilbert space used to model the combination of concepts?,"  We extend a quantum model in Hilbert space developed in Aerts (2007a) into a
quantum field theoric model in Fock space for the modeling of the combination
of concepts. Items and concepts are represented by vectors in Fock space and
membership weights of items are modeled by quantum probabilities. We apply this
theory to model the disjunction of concepts and show that the predictions of
our theory for the membership weights of items regarding the disjunction of
concepts match with great accuracy the complete set of results of an experiment
conducted by Hampton (1988b). It are the quantum effects of interference and
superposition of that are at the origin of the effects of overextension and
underextension observed by Hampton as deviations from a classical use of the
disjunction. It is essential for the perfect matches we obtain between the
predictions of the quantum field model and Hampton's experimental data that
items can be in superpositions of `different numbers states' which proves that
the genuine structure of quantum field theory is needed to match predictions
with experimental data.
"
What is the generalization of escape rate from a metastable state for externally driven correlated noise processes in one dimension?,"  We propose generalization of escape rate from a metastable state for
externally driven correlated noise processes in one dimension. In addition to
the internal non-Markovian thermal fluctuations, the external correlated noise
processes we consider are Gaussian, stationary in nature and are of
Ornstein-Uhlenbeck type. Based on a Fokker-Planck description of the effective
noise processes with finite memory we derive the generalized escape rate from a
metastable state in the moderate to large damping limit and investigate the
effect of degree of correlation on the resulting rate. Comparison of the
theoretical expression with numerical simulation gives a satisfactory agreement
and shows that by increasing the degree of external noise correlation one can
enhance the escape rate through the dressed effective noise strength.
"
What are the fractional quantum Hall states described by the proposed wavefunctions?,"  By applying the idea of parafermionic clustering to composite bosons with
positive as well as negative flux, a new series of trial wavefunctions to
describe fractional quantum Hall states is proposed. These non-Abelian states
compete at filling factors k/(3k +/- 2) with other ground states like stripes
or composite fermion states. These two series contain all the states recently
discovered by Pan et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 90, 016801 (2003)] including the
even denominator cases. Exact diagonalization studies on the sphere and torus
point to their possible relevance for filling factors 3/7, 3/11, and 3/8.
"
What are the factors that control the amplitude of the low energy cut-off in the cosmic ray spectrum?,"  Various experiments indicate the existence of a second knee around energy
E=3.10^{17} eV in the cosmic ray spectrum. This feature could be the signature
of the end of the galactic component and of the emergence of the extragalactic
one, provided that the latter cuts off at low energies. Recent analytical
calculations have shown that this cut-off could be a consequence of the
existence of extragalactic magnetic fields: low energy protons diffuse on
extragalactic magnetic fields and cannot reach the observer within a given
time. We study the influence of inhomogeneous magnetic fields on the magnetic
horizon, using a new semi-analytical propagation code. Our results indicate
that, at a fixed value of the volume averaged magnetic field <B>, the amplitude
of the low energy cut-off is mainly controled by the strength of magnetic
fields in the voids of the large scale structure distribution.
"
What is the thermostatistics of the phase space with fractal dimension d governed by the Tsallis formalism?,"  We consider a self-similar phase space with specific fractal dimension $d$
being distributed with spectrum function $f(d)$. Related thermostatistics is
shown to be governed by the Tsallis formalism of the non-extensive statistics,
where the non-additivity parameter is equal to ${\bar\tau}(q)\equiv
1/\tau(q)>1$, and the multifractal function $\tau(q)= qd_q-f(d_q)$ is the
specific heat determined with multifractal parameter $q\in [1,\infty)$. In this
way, the equipartition law is shown to take place. Optimization of the
multifractal spectrum function $f(d)$ derives the relation between the
statistical weight and the system complexity. It is shown the statistical
weight exponent $\tau(q)$ can be modeled by hyperbolic tangent deformed in
accordance with both Tsallis and Kaniadakis exponentials to describe arbitrary
multifractal phase space explicitly. The spectrum function $f(d)$ is proved to
increase monotonically from minimum value $f=-1$ at $d=0$ to maximum one $f=1$
at $d=1$. At the same time, the number of monofractals increases with growth of
the phase space volume at small dimensions $d$ and falls down in the limit
$d\to 1$.
"
What is the result of combining a combinatorial approach with a Bozejko-Picardello type inequality to prove that hyperbolic groups are weakly amenable?,"  We prove that hyperbolic groups are weakly amenable. This partially extends
the result of Cowling and Haagerup showing that lattices in simple Lie groups
of real rank one are weakly amenable. We take a combinatorial approach in the
spirit of Haagerup and prove that for the word length metric d on a hyperbolic
group, the Schur multipliers associated with r^d have uniformly bounded norms
for 0<r<1. We then combine this with a Bozejko-Picardello type inequality to
obtain weak amenability.
"
What is the relationship between cell packing and cell shape in the Drosophila retina?,"  Hayashi and Carthew (Nature 431 [2004], 647) have shown that the packing of
cone cells in the Drosophila retina resembles soap bubble packing, and that
changing E- and N-cadherin expression can change this packing, as well as cell
shape.
  The analogy with bubbles suggests that cell packing is driven by surface
minimization. We find that this assumption is insufficient to model the
experimentally observed shapes and packing of the cells based on their cadherin
expression. We then consider a model in which adhesion leads to a surface
increase, balanced by cell cortex contraction. Using the experimentally
observed distributions of E- and N-cadherin, we simulate the packing and cell
shapes in the wildtype eye. Furthermore, by changing only the corresponding
parameters, this model can describe the mutants with different numbers of
cells, or changes in cadherin expression.
"
What is the condition for a nilpotent algebra to be an Einstein nilradical?,"  The structure of a solvable Lie groups admitting an Einstein left-invariant
metric is, in a sense, completely determined by the nilradical of its Lie
algebra. We give an easy-to-check necessary and sufficient condition for a
nilpotent algebra to be an Einstein nilradical whose Einstein derivation has
simple eigenvalues. As an application, we classify filiform Einstein
nilradicals (modulo known classification results on filiform graded Lie
algebras).
"
What is the effect of combining different data sets on the constraints on the spectral index of primordial density fluctuation n_s?,"  We present constraints on the amplitude and shape of the matter power
spectrum and the density of dark matter within the framework of a standard
LambdaCDM model. We use a Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach to combine
independent measurements of the three dimensional weak gravitational lensing
shear field by the COSMOS survey, of low and high resolution Ly-alpha forest
flux power spectrum by SDSS and LUQAS, and of Cosmic Microwave Background
temperature and polarization anisotropies by WMAP. We note good agreement
between the amplitude of the matter power spectrum on intermediate and small
scales as inferred from Ly-alpha forest and lensing data. The Ly-alpha forest
data helps to break the sigma_8-Omega_m degeneracy characteristic of weak
lensing results, yielding sigma_8 = 0.876 +- 0.048 for COSMOS plus Ly-alpha
SDSS data. This is somewhat larger than the value preferred by the WMAP year
three CMB data. Combining all three data sets significantly tightens the
constraints on sigma_8, the spectral index of primordial density fluctuation
n_s, a possible running of the spectral index n_run and the matter density
Omega_m. Assuming no running, the joint constraints for COSMOS, SDSS and WMAP
are sigma_8 = 0.800 +- 0.023, n_s = 0.971 +- 0.011, Omega_m = 0.247 +- 0.016
(1-sigma error bars).
"
What are the critical rotation frequencies in a ferromagnet with finite size?,"  Through exact numerical diagonalization for small numbers of atoms, we show
that it is possible to access quantum Hall states in harmonically confined Bose
gases at rotation frequencies well below the centrifugal limit by applying a
repulsive Gaussian potential at the trap center. The main idea is to reduce or
eliminate the effective trapping frequency in regions where the particle
density is appreciable. The critical rotation frequency required to obtain the
bosonic Laughlin state can be fixed at an experimentally accessible value by
choosing an applied Gaussian whose amplitude increases linearly with the number
of atoms while its width increases as the square root.
"
What is the relationship between the pseudogap structure and the superconducting transition temperature Tc in the ARPES spectrum?,"  The electronic structure of Bi2Sr2-xRxCuOy(R=La, Eu) near the (pi,0) point of
the first Brillouin zone was studied by means of angle-resolved photoemission
spectroscopy (ARPES). The temperature T* above which the pseudogap structure in
the ARPES spectrum disappears was found to have an R dependence that is
opposite to that ofthe superconducting transition temperature Tc. This
indicates that the pseudogap state is competing with high-Tc superconductivity,
and the large Tc suppression observed with increasing the out-of-plane disorder
is due to the stabilization of the pseudogap state.
"
What are the differences between the microwave photovoltage technique and the conventional methods used to measure spin excitations in ferromagnets?,"  I offer some personal reminiscences from the period of 1976-1983, when I was
a M. Sc. and then a Ph.D. student in Vitaly L. Ginzburg's High Temperature
Superconductivity group at the P.N. Lebedev Institute in Moscow
"
What is the optimal collection of subspaces that minimize the sum of the square of the distances between each vector and its closest subspace in the collection?,"  Given a set of vectors (the data) in a Hilbert space H, we prove the
existence of an optimal collection of subspaces minimizing the sum of the
square of the distances between each vector and its closest subspace in the
collection. This collection of subspaces gives the best sparse representation
for the given data, in a sense defined in the paper, and provides an optimal
model for sampling in union of subspaces. The results are proved in a general
setting and then applied to the case of low dimensional subspaces of R^N and to
infinite dimensional shift-invariant spaces in L^2(R^d). We also present an
iterative search algorithm for finding the solution subspaces. These results
are tightly connected to the new emergent theories of compressed sensing and
dictionary design, signal models for signals with finite rate of innovation,
and the subspace segmentation problem.
"
What are the origins of the PVLAS measurement result?,"  One of the magneto-optical properties of the mirrors of the Fabry-Perot
cavity used for the experiment is considered as a possible origin of the PVLAS
measurement result.
"
What is the representation of complex weight functions as real and positive weights?,"  The necessity of computing integrals with complex weights over manifolds with
a large number of dimensions, e.g., in some field theoretical settings, poses a
problem for the use of Monte Carlo techniques. Here it is shown that very
general complex weight functions P(x) on R^d can be represented by real and
positive weights p(z) on C^d, in the sense that for any observable f, <f(x)>_P
= <f(z)>_p, f(z) being the analytical extension of f(x). The construction is
extended to arbitrary compact Lie groups.
"
What are the differences between the results from the CLEO III and the previous results?,"  Using recent CLEO III results for the cross section for $e^+e^- \to {\rm
hadrons}$ at seven centre-of-mass energies between 6.964 and 10.538 GeV, we
derive a value for the strong coupling constant
$\alpha_s(M_Z^2)=0.110_{-0.012}^{-0.010}{}_{-0.011}^{+0.010}$ where the
uncertainties are uncorrelated and correlated, respectively. Our result differs
significantly from the one derived by CLEO III, as a consequence of inclusion
of quark mass effects and the proper matching between the effective theories
with four and five flavours. Combining this new result with an analysis based
on earlier cross section measurements in the energy region between 2 and 10.6
GeV, we obtain $\alpha_s(M_Z^2)=0.119^{+0.009}_{-0.011}$, well consistent with
the current world average.
"
What are the doubly-excited states of opposite parity in the intermediate compound ion?,"  We discuss a parity nonconserving (PNC) asymmetry in the cross section of
dielectronic recombination of polarized electrons on multiply charged ions with
Z>40. This effect is strongly enhanced for close doubly-excited states of
opposite parity in the intermediate compound ion. Such states are known for
He-like ions. However, these levels have large energy and large radiative
widths which hampers observation of the PNC asymmetry. We argue that
accidentally degenerate states of the more complex ions may be more suitable
for the corresponding experiment.
"
What is the relationship between the Bayes predictor and the optimal predictor for dynamical systems?,"  We consider the problem of designing almost optimal predictors for dynamical
systems from a finite sequence of noisy observations and incomplete knowledge
of the dynamics and the noise. We first discuss the properties of the optimal
(Bayes) predictor and present the limitations of memory-free forecasting
methods, and of any finite memory methods in general. We then show that a
nonparametric support vector machine approach to forecasting can consistently
learn the optimal predictor for all pairs of dynamical systems and bounded
observational noise processes that possess summable correlation sequences.
Numerical experiments show that this approach adapts the memory length of the
forecaster to the complexity of the learning task and the size of the
observation sequence.
"
What are the dynamical analysis and verification of the propagation and constraint equations for a Weyssenhoff fluid?,"  The Weyssenhoff fluid is a perfect fluid with spin where the spin of the
matter fields is the source of torsion in an Einstein-Cartan framework. Obukhov
and Korotky showed that this fluid can be described as an effective fluid with
spin in general relativity. A dynamical analysis of such a fluid is performed
in a gauge invariant manner using the 1+3 covariant approach. This yields the
propagation and constraint equations for the set of dynamical variables. A
verification of these equations is performed for the special case of
irrotational flow with zero peculiar acceleration by evolving the constraints.
"
What is the upper bound of the complexity of a module over a local ring?,"  A method is provided for computing an upper bound of the complexity of a
module over a local ring, in terms of vanishing of certain cohomology modules.
We then specialize to complete intersections, which are precisely the rings
over which all modules have finite complexity.
"
What are the four possible IMRI formation mechanisms analyzed in this paper?,"  Gravitational waves (GWs) from the inspiral of a neutron star (NS) or
stellar-mass black hole (BH) into an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) with
mass between ~50 and ~350 solar masses may be detectable by the planned
advanced generation of ground-based GW interferometers. Such intermediate mass
ratio inspirals (IMRIs) are most likely to be found in globular clusters. We
analyze four possible IMRI formation mechanisms: (1) hardening of an NS-IMBH or
BH-IMBH binary via three-body interactions, (2) hardening via Kozai resonance
in a hierarchical triple system, (3) direct capture, and (4) inspiral of a
compact object from a tidally captured main-sequence star; we also discuss
tidal effects when the inspiraling object is an NS. For each mechanism we
predict the typical eccentricities of the resulting IMRIs. We find that IMRIs
will have largely circularized by the time they enter the sensitivity band of
ground-based detectors. Hardening of a binary via three-body interactions,
which is likely to be the dominant mechanism for IMRI formation, yields
eccentricities under 10^-4 when the GW frequency reaches 10 Hz. Even among
IMRIs formed via direct captures, which can have the highest eccentricities,
around 90% will circularize to eccentricities under 0.1 before the GW frequency
reaches 10 Hz. We estimate the rate of IMRI coalescences in globular clusters
and the sensitivity of a network of three Advanced LIGO detectors to the
resulting GWs. We show that this detector network may see up to tens of IMRIs
per year, although rates of one to a few per year may be more plausible. We
also estimate the loss in signal-to-noise ratio that will result from using
circular IMRI templates for data analysis and find that, for the eccentricities
we expect, this loss is negligible.
"
How does the market structure in NSE differ from that of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE)?,"  The cross-correlations between price fluctuations of 201 frequently traded
stocks in the National Stock Exchange (NSE) of India are analyzed in this
paper. We use daily closing prices for the period 1996-2006, which coincides
with the period of rapid transformation of the market following liberalization.
The eigenvalue distribution of the cross-correlation matrix, $\mathbf{C}$, of
NSE is found to be similar to that of developed markets, such as the New York
Stock Exchange (NYSE): the majority of eigenvalues fall within the bounds
expected for a random matrix constructed from mutually uncorrelated time
series. Of the few largest eigenvalues that deviate from the bulk, the largest
is identified with market-wide movements. The intermediate eigenvalues that
occur between the largest and the bulk have been associated in NYSE with
specific business sectors with strong intra-group interactions. However, in the
Indian market, these deviating eigenvalues are comparatively very few and lie
much closer to the bulk. We propose that this is because of the relative lack
of distinct sector identity in the market, with the movement of stocks
dominantly influenced by the overall market trend. This is shown by explicit
construction of the interaction network in the market, first by generating the
minimum spanning tree from the unfiltered correlation matrix, and later, using
an improved method of generating the graph after filtering out the market mode
and random effects from the data. Both methods show, compared to developed
markets, the relative absence of clusters of co-moving stocks that belong to
the same business sector. This is consistent with the general belief that
emerging markets tend to be more correlated than developed markets.
"
What is the definition of a C-equivalence relation on a finite set?,"  For each clone C on a set A there is an associated equivalence relation,
called C-equivalence, on the set of all operations on A, which relates two
operations iff each one is a substitution instance of the other using
operations from C. In this paper we prove that if C is a discriminator clone on
a finite set, then there are only finitely many C-equivalence classes.
Moreover, we show that the smallest discriminator clone is minimal with respect
to this finiteness property. For discriminator clones of Boolean functions we
explicitly describe the associated equivalence relations.
"
What are the conditions under which the transresistance can be fractionally suppressed or very weakly influenced?,"  We study the effect of the ferromagnetic (FM) contacts on the spin
accumulation in the lateral spin valve system for the collinear magnetization
configurations. When an additional FM electrode is introduced in the
all-metallic lateral spin-valve system, we find that the transresistance can be
fractionally suppressed or very weakly influenced depending on the position of
the additional FM electrode, and relative magnitudes of contact resistance and
the bulk resistance defined over the spin diffusion length. Nonlocal spin
signals such as nonlocal voltage drop and leakage spin currents are independent
of the magnetization orientation of the additional FM electrode. Even when the
additional contact is nonmagnetic, nonlocal spin signals can be changed by the
spin current leaking into the nonmagnetic electrode.
"
How does the inclusion of electron-electron bremsstrahlung affect the electron spectrum required to produce a given hard X-ray spectrum?,"  Although both electron-ion and electron-electron bremsstrahlung contribute to
the hard X-ray emission from solar flares, the latter is normally ignored. Such
an omission is not justified at electron (and photon) energies above $\sim 300$
keV, and inclusion of the additional electron-electron bremsstrahlung in
general makes the electron spectrum required to produce a given hard X-ray
spectrum steeper at high energies.
  Unlike electron-ion bremsstrahlung, electron-electron bremsstrahlung cannot
produce photons of all energies up to the maximum electron energy involved. The
maximum possible photon energy depends on the angle between the direction of
the emitting electron and the emitted photon, and this suggests a diagnostic
for an upper cutoff energy and/or for the degree of beaming of the accelerated
electrons.
  We analyze the large event of January 17, 2005 observed by RHESSI and show
that the upward break around 400 keV in the observed hard X-ray spectrum is
naturally accounted for by the inclusion of electron-electron bremsstrahlung.
Indeed, the mean source electron spectrum recovered through a regularized
inversion of the hard X-ray spectrum, using a cross-section that includes both
electron-ion and electron-electron terms, has a relatively constant spectral
index $\delta$ over the range from electron kinetic energy $E = 200$ keV to $E
= 1$ MeV. However, the level of detail discernible in the recovered electron
spectrum is not sufficient to determine whether or not any upper cutoff energy
exists.
"
What are the implications of the structural anomaly in the second shell upon compression?,"  We perform molecular dynamics simulation of water using the TIP5P model to
quantify structural order in both the first shell (defined by four nearest
neighbors)and second shell (defined by twelve next-nearest neighbors) of a
central water molecule. We find the anomalous decrease of orientational order
upon compression occurs in both shells, but the anomalous decrease of
translational order upon compression occurs {\it mainly in the second shell}.
The decreases of translational and orientational orders upon compression
(""structural anomaly"") are thus correlated only in the second shell. Our
findings quantitatively confirm the qualitative idea that the thermodynamic,
dynamic and structural anomalies of water are related to changes in the second
shell upon compression.
"
What are the implications of the quark gluon matter for the understanding of the strong interaction in the universe?,"  I present here a concise review of the experimental results obtained at the
Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC), which shed light on the hot and dense
quark gluon matter produced at these high temperature and density conditions.
"
What is the nuclear matter density in a nucleus?,"  The well-known correlations of low-energy three and four-nucleon observables
with a typical three-nucleon scale (e.g., the Tjon line) is extended to light
nuclei and nuclear matter. Evidence for the scaling between light nuclei
binding energies and the triton one are pointed out. We argue that the
saturation energy and density of nuclear matter are correlated to the triton
binding energy. The available systematic nuclear matter calculations indicate a
possible band structure representing these correlations.
"
What is the location of the Kilodegree Extremely Little Telescope (KELT) telescope?,"  The Kilodegree Extremely Little Telescope (KELT) project is a survey for
planetary transits of bright stars. It consists of a small-aperture, wide-field
automated telescope located at Winer Observatory near Sonoita, Arizona. The
telescope surveys a set of 26 x 26 degree fields, together covering about 25%
of the Northern sky, targeting stars in the range of 8<V<10 mag, searching for
transits by close-in Jupiters. This paper describes the system hardware and
software and discusses the quality of the observations. We show that KELT is
able to achieve the necessary photometric precision to detect planetary
transits around solar-type main sequence stars.
"
What are the key factors influencing the flow stress in materials with periodic potential relief of the crystal lattice?,"  The theory of the dislocation motion in the periodic potential relief of the
crystal lattice (the Peierls-Nabarro barriers) is reviewed. On the basis of the
kink mechanism the temperature dependence of the flow stress is described for a
wide class of materials. The theory of quantum mechanical dislocation
tunnelling through the Peierls-Nabarro barriers is extended and compared with
experimental data on the plasticity of alkali halides, BCC and HCP metals at
low temperatures. The behavior of the flow stress at the range of athermic
anomalies is modeled by changing the mechanism of the dislocation motion from
the thermally activated hopping over the barriers to the quantum tunnelling
through them. Some results of previous calculations are represented in a more
explicit convenient for applications form. The pronounced effect of the
switching between the normal and the superconducting states on the flow stress
of metals is explained on the basis of the change in the dissipative properties
of the electron subsystem affecting the dislocation motion.
"
"What are the conditions for the formation of a ""charge density wave in the low-temperature phases of a two-component Fermi gas with attractive s-wave interactions?","  We study theoretically the low-temperature phases of a two-component atomic
Fermi gas with attractive s-wave interactions under conditions of rapid
rotation. We find that, in the extreme quantum limit, when all particles occupy
the lowest Landau level, the normal state is unstable to the formation of
""charge"" density wave (CDW) order. At lower rotation rates, when many Landau
levels are occupied, we show that the low-temperature phases can be
supersolids, involving both CDW and superconducting order.
"
What is the relationship between general classes of modified gravity models and the observed cosmic acceleration?,"  Modified gravity provides a possible explanation for the currently observed
cosmic accelaration. In this paper, we study general classes of modified
gravity models. The Einstein-Hilbert action is modified by using general
functions of the Ricci and the Gauss-Bonnet scalars, both in the metric and in
the Palatini formalisms. We do not use an explicit form for the functions, but
a general form with a valid Taylor expansion up to second order about redshift
zero in the Riemann-scalars. The coefficients of this expansion are then
reconstructed via the cosmic expansion history measured using current
cosmological observations. These are the quantities of interest for theoretical
considerations relating to ghosts and instabilities. We find that current data
provide interesting constraints on the coefficients. The next-generation dark
energy surveys should shrink the allowed parameter space for modifed gravity
models quite dramatically.
"
What is the energy spectrum of charged pions produced in hadronic interactions?,"  Charged pions produced in very high energy hadronic interactions might be the
dominant source of cosmic neutrinos in the GeV--TeV range. Spectral energy
power of \pi^+ radiation by high energy protons moving in strong magnetic
fields typical for magnetars is determined with a semiclassical treatment of
the effective pion-nucleon model. The main characteristics emerging from a
saddle point approximation to the summation over the allowed range of Landau
levels is a sharp lower cut: E_\pi>0.25 E_p. The magnitude of the spectral
power agrees in this region with the synchrotron radiation spectra of neutral
pions.
"
What is the flavor basis for neutrinoless double beta-decay?,"  It is proposed that light neutrinos form a triplet in a global SU(3) symmetry
in mass eigenstate basis. Assuming that the SU(3)symmetry is broken in the
direction (-alambda_{3}+frac{b}/{sqrt{3}}lambda_{8}), and after going to the
flavor basis we predict atmospheric mixing angle, sin ^{2}theta_{23}=0.5 and
sin theta_{13}=0 if nu_{mu}-nu_{tau} symmetry is assumed. In the flavor basis
the diagonal part of matrix coefficient of b (dominant part) is found to
transform like (lambda_{3}+frac{1}/{sqrt{3}}lambda_{8}). Imposing the same on
matrix coefficient of $a$ fixes solar mixing angle,sin ^{2}theta
_{12}=frac{1}{3}. Implications for neutrinoless double beta-decay are
discussed.
"
What is the gravitino mass determined by the branching ratio of two decay modes of sleptons?,"  Gauge mediated supersymmetry breaking scenarios with an ultra-light gravitino
of mass m_{3/2}=1-10 eV are very interesting, since there is no cosmological
gravitino problem. We propose a new experimental determination of the gravitino
mass for such an ultra-light gravitino, by measuring a branching ratio of two
decay modes of sleptons.
"
What is the generalization of the identities of MacMahon and Andrews?,"  The number of partitions of n into parts divisible by a or b equals the
number of partitions of n in which each part and each difference of two parts
is expressible as a non-negative integer combination of a or b. This
generalizes identities of MacMahon and Andrews. The analogous identities for
three or more integers (in place of a,b) hold in certain cases.
"
What is the cosmological bounce model used to calculate the evolution of the fluctuations?,"  We study the transfer of cosmological perturbations through a nonsingular
cosmological bounce in a special model in which the parameters of the bounce
and the equation of state of matter are chosen such as to allow for an exact
calculation of the evolution of the fluctuations. We find that the growing mode
of the metric fluctuations in the contracting phase goes over into the growing
mode in the expanding phase, a result which is different from what is obtained
in analyses in which fluctuations are matched at a singular hypersurface.
Consequences for Ekpyrotic cosmology are discussed in a limit when the equation
of state of a fluid becomes large.
"
What are the detector systematics effects and theoretical uncertainties discussed?,"  The LHC provides new opportunities to improve our understanding of the b
quark using high statistics data samples and the 14 TeV center-of-mass energy.
The prospects to measure the cross section for inclusive b production in events
containing jets and at least one muon are presented. Studies of detector
systematic effects and theoretical uncertainties are included. QCD aspects of
the beauty production are discussed.
"
"What are the results of the SANS, SLS, and DLS measurements on bottlebrush macromolecules?","  We study bottlebrush macromolecules in a good solvent by small-angle neutron
scattering (SANS), static light scattering (SLS), and dynamic light scattering
(DLS). These polymers consist of a linear backbone to which long side chains
are chemically grafted. The backbone contains about 1600 monomer units (weight
average) and every second monomer unit carries side-chains with ca. 60 monomer
units. The SLS- and SANS data extrapolated to infinite dilution lead to the
form factor of the polymer that can be described in terms of a worm-like chain
with a contour length of 380 nm and a persistence length of 17.5 nm. An
analysis of the DLS data confirm these model parameters. The scattering
intensities taken at finite concentration can be modeled using the polymer
reference interaction site model. It reveals a softening of the bottlebrush
polymers caused by their mutual interaction. We demonstrate that the
persistence decreases from 17.5 nm down to 5 nm upon increasing the
concentration from dilute solution to the highest concentration 40.59 g/l under
consideration. The observed softening of the chains is comparable to the
theoretically predicted decrease of the electrostatic persistence length of
linear polyelectrolyte chains at finite concentrations.
"
What are the implications of the results of the analysis of the coordination control of a group of autonomous mobile agents with multiple leaders?,"  In this paper, we consider the coordination control of a group of autonomous
mobile agents with multiple leaders. Different interconnection topologies are
investigated. At first, a necessary and sufficient condition is proved in the
case of fixed interconnection topology. Then a sufficient condition is proposed
when the interconnection topology is switched. With a simple first-order
dynamics model by using the neighborhood rule, both results show that the group
behavior of the agents will converge to the polytope formed by the leaders.
"
What is the method to measure the amount of disclosure of sensitive information in the worst-case scenario?,"  Recent work has shown the necessity of considering an attacker's background
knowledge when reasoning about privacy in data publishing. However, in
practice, the data publisher does not know what background knowledge the
attacker possesses. Thus, it is important to consider the worst-case. In this
paper, we initiate a formal study of worst-case background knowledge. We
propose a language that can express any background knowledge about the data. We
provide a polynomial time algorithm to measure the amount of disclosure of
sensitive information in the worst case, given that the attacker has at most a
specified number of pieces of information in this language. We also provide a
method to efficiently sanitize the data so that the amount of disclosure in the
worst case is less than a specified threshold.
"
What are the conditions under which the functional equation is stable?,"  Let $S$ be a semigroup and $X$ a Banach space. The functional equation $\phi
(xyz)+ \phi (x) + \phi (y) + \phi (z) = \phi (xy) + \phi (yz) + \phi (xz)$ is
said to be stable for the pair $(X, S)$ if and only if $f: S\to X$ satisfying
$\| f(xyz)+f(x) + f(y) + f(z) - f(xy)- f(yz)-f(xz)\| \leq \delta $ for some
positive real number $\delta$ and all $x, y, z \in S$, there is a solution
$\phi : S \to X$ such that $f-\phi$ is bounded. In this paper, among others, we
prove the following results: 1) this functional equation, in general, is not
stable on an arbitrary semigroup; 2) this equation is stable on periodic
semigroups; 3) this equation is stable on abelian semigroups; 4) any semigroup
with left (or right) law of reduction can be embedded into a semigroup with
left (or right) law of reduction where this equation is stable.
"
What is the role of extra interactions and dimer flips in the quantum dimer model for quantum computation?,"  We use a nonperturbative extended contractor renormalization (ENCORE) method
for engineering quantum devices for the implementation of topologically
protected quantum bits described by an effective quantum dimer model on the
triangular lattice. By tuning the couplings of the device, topological
protection might be achieved if the ratio between effective two-dimer
interactions and flip amplitudes lies in the liquid phase of the phase diagram
of the quantum dimer model. For a proposal based on a quantum Josephson
junction array [L. B. Ioffe {\it et al.}, Nature (London) {\bf 415}, 503
(2002)] our results show that optimal operational temperatures below 1 mK can
only be obtained if extra interactions and dimer flips, which are not present
in the standard quantum dimer model and involve three or four dimers, are
included. It is unclear if these extra terms in the quantum dimer Hamiltonian
destroy the liquid phase needed for quantum computation. Minimizing the effects
of multi-dimer terms would require energy scales in the nano-Kelvin regime. An
alternative implementation based on cold atomic or molecular gases loaded into
optical lattices is also discussed, and it is shown that the small energy
scales involved--implying long operational times--make such a device
impractical. Given the many orders of magnitude between bare couplings in
devices, and the topological gap, the realization of topological phases in
quantum devices requires careful engineering and large bare interaction scales.
"
What are the conditions that imply the existence of a hypo-contact structure?,"  We consider 5-manifolds with a contact form arising from a hypo structure,
which we call \emph{hypo-contact}. We provide conditions which imply that there
exists such a structure on an oriented hypersurface of a 6-manifold with a
half-flat SU(3)-structure. For half-flat manifolds with a Killing vector field
$X$ preserving the SU(3)-structure we study the geometry of the orbits space.
Moreover, we describe the solvable Lie algebras admitting a \emph{hypo-contact}
structure. This allows us exhibit examples of Sasakian $\eta$-Einstein
manifolds, as well as to prove that such structures give rise to new metrics
with holonomy SU(3) and to new metrics with holonomy $G_2$.
"
How does the elastic interaction among the lattice distortions provide the cooperative interaction of the spin states?,"  We study the origin of the cooperative nature of spin crossover (SC) between
low spin (LS) and high spin (HS) states from the view point of elastic
interactions among molecules. As the size of each molecule changes depending on
its spin state, the elastic interaction among the lattice distortions provides
the cooperative interaction of the spin states. We develop a simple model of SC
with intra and intermolecular potentials which accounts for the elastic
interaction including the effect of the inhomogeneity of the spin states, and
apply constant temperature molecular dynamics based on the Nos\'e-Hoover
formalism. We demonstrate that, with increase of the strength of the
intermolecular interactions, the temperature dependence of the HS component
changes from a gradual crossover to a first-order transition.
"
What are the implications of entanglement sudden death for quantum computing?,"  In this paper we consider the decay of quantum entanglement, quantified by
the concurrence, of a pair of two-level systems each of which is interacting
with a reservoir at finite temperature T. For a broad class of initially
entangled states, we demonstrate that the system always becomes disentangled in
a finite time i.e.""entanglement sudden death"" (ESD) occurs. This class includes
all states which previously had been found to have long-lived entanglement in
zero temperature reservoirs. Our general result is illustrated by an example.
"
"What are the properties of the base change operator W_{k',k}?","  This paper extends earlier work on quantum theory representations of natural
numbers N, integers I, and rational numbers Ra to describe a space of these
representations and transformations on the space. The space is parameterized by
4-tuple points in a parameter set. Each point, (k,m,h,g), labels a specific
representation of X = N, I, Ra as a Fock space F^{X}_{k,m,h} of states of
finite length strings of qukits q and a string state basis B^{X}_{k,m,h,g}. The
pair (m,h) locates the q string in a square integer lattice I \times I, k is
the q base, and the function g fixes the gauge or basis states for each q. Maps
on the parameter set induce transformations on on the representation space.
There are two shifts, a base change operator W_{k',k}, and a basis or gauge
transformation function U_{k}. The invariance of the axioms and theorems for N,
I, and Ra under any transformation is discussed along with the dependence of
the properties of W_{k',k} on the prime factors of k' and k. This suggests that
one consider prime number q's, q_{2}, q_{3}, q_{5}, etc. as elementary and the
base k q's as composites of the prime number q's.
"
What is the coarse-grained multi-blob description of polymer solutions?,"  A coarse-grained multi-blob description of polymer solutions is presented,
based on soft, transferable effective interactions between bonded and
non-bonded blobs. The number of blobs is chosen such that the blob density does
not exceed their overlap threshold, allowing polymer concentrations to be
explored deep into the semi-dilute regime. This quantitative multi-blob
description is shown to preserve known scaling laws of polymer solutions and
provides accurate estimates of amplitudes, while leading to orders of magnitude
increase of simulation efficiency and allowing analytic calculations of
structural and thermodynamic properties.
"
"What are the changes in antioxidant capacity in the hippocampus, cortex, and striatum after cerebral ischemia?","  The time course of oxidative damage in different brain regions was
investigated in the gerbil model of transient cerebral ischemia. Animals were
subjected to both common carotid arteries occlusion for 5 min. After the end of
ischemia and at different reperfusion times (2, 6, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96 h and 7
days), markers of lipid peroxidation, reduced and oxidized glutathione levels,
glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, manganese-dependent superoxide
dismutase (MnSOD) and copper/zinc containing SOD (Cu/ZnSOD) activities were
measured in hippocampus, cortex and striatum. Oxidative damage in hippocampus
was maximal at late stages after ischemia (48-96 h) coincident with a
significant impairment in glutathione homeostasis. MnSOD increased in
hippocampus at 24, 48 and 72 h after ischemia, coincident with the marked
reduction in the activity of glutathione-related enzymes. The late disturbance
in oxidant-antioxidant balance corresponds with the time course of delayed
neuronal loss in the hippocampal CA1 sector. Cerebral cortex showed early
changes in oxidative damage with no significant impairment in antioxidant
capacity. Striatal lipid peroxidation significantly increased as early as 2 h
after ischemia and persisted until 48 h with respect to the sham-operated
group. These results contribute significant information on the timing and
factors that influence free radical formation following ischemic brain injury,
an essential step in determining effective antioxidant intervention.
"
What is the effect of Mn on the solubility of GaAs?,"  We report on simple experiment on temperature-dependent Hall effect
measurements in GaMnAs single crystalline samples with Mn composition estimated
at 0.05-0.3 at.% which is slightly below the onset of ferromagnetism. Impurity
band transport is visible for Mn compositions of ~0.3 at.% as a clear metallic
behaviour. The results show interesting situation that the Metal-Insulator
transition in GaAs:Mn occurs within the impurity band which is separated from
the valence bands for Mn concentrations studied here. We also discuss on the
equilibrium high temperature solubility limit of Mn in GaAs, unknown precisely
in the literature.
"
What is the role of vector meson production in ultra-peripheral collisions of heavy ions at LHC?,"  Vector meson production in ultra-peripheral collisions of heavy ions at LHC
is calculated in VDM and color dipole approaches.
"
What is the local density of states (LDOS) around a single vortex core of YNi2B2C?,"  To determine the superconducting gap function of YNi2B2C, we calculate the
local density of states (LDOS) around a single vortex core with the use of
Eilenberger theory and the band structure calculated by local density
approximation assuming various gap structures with point-nodes at different
positions. We also calculate the angular-dependent heat capacity in the vortex
state on the basis of the Doppler-Shift method. Comparing our results with the
STM/STS experiment, the angular-dependent heat capacity and thermal
conductivity, we propose the gap-structure of YNi2B2C, which has the
point-nodes and gap minima along <110>. Our gap-structure is consistent with
all results of angular-resolved experiments.
"
What is the implication of the result in several models of this kind?,"  We consider the asymptotic behaviour of the solution of one dimensional
stochastic differential equations and Langevin equations in periodic
backgrounds with zero average. We prove that in several such models, there is
generically a non vanishing asymptotic velocity, despite of the fact that the
average of the background is zero.
"
What is the purpose of observing the Magellanic Clouds (LMC/SMC) with the Spitzer telescope?,"  Because Spitzer is an Earth-trailing orbit, losing about 0.1 AU/yr, it is
excellently located to perform microlens parallax observations toward the
Magellanic Clouds (LMC/SMC) and the Galactic bulge. These yield the so-called
``projected velocity'' of the lens, which can distinguish statistically among
different populations. A few such measurements toward the LMC/SMC would reveal
the nature of the lenses being detected in this direction (dark halo objects,
or ordinary LMC/SMC stars). Cool Spitzer has already made one such measurement
of a (rare) bright red-clump source, but warm (presumably less oversubscribed)
Spitzer could devote the extra time required to obtain microlens parallaxes for
the more common, but fainter, turnoff sources. Warm Spitzer could observe bulge
microlenses for 38 days per year, which would permit up to 24 microlens
parallaxes per year. This would yield interesting information on the disk mass
function, particularly old brown dwarfs, which at present are inaccessible by
other techniques. Target-of-Opportunity (TOO) observations should be divided
into RTOO/DTOO, i.e., ``regular'' and ``disruptive'' TOOs, as pioneered by the
Space Interferometry Mission (SIM). LMC/SMC parallax measurements would be
DTOO, but bulge measurements would be RTOO, i.e., they could be scheduled in
advance, without knowing exactly which star was to be observed.
"
What are the results of the High Resolution Fly's Eye (HiRes) Experiment?,"  The status of the field of ultrahigh energy cosmic rays is summarized, from
the point of view of the latest results of the High Resolution Fly's Eye
(HiRes) Experiment. HiRes results are presented, and compared with those of the
Akeno Giant Air Shower Array (AGASA), plus the Telescope Array and Pierre Auger
experiments. The HiRes measurements of the cosmic ray spectrum, and the
observation of the GZK cutoff are presented. HiRes results on composition,
searches for anisotropy, measurement of the proton-air total cross section, and
shapes of shower profiles are presented.
"
What is the sister surface of an entire minimal graph in Nil_3?,"  We construct a one-parameter family of properly embedded minimal annuli in
the Heisenberg group Nil_3 endowed with a left-invariant Riemannian metric.
These annuli are not rotationally invariant. This family gives a vertical
half-space theorem and proves that each complete minimal graph in Nil_3 is
entire. Also, the sister surface of an entire minimal graph in Nil_3 is an
entire constant mean curvature 1/2 graph in H^2 x R, and conversely. This gives
a classification of all entire constant mean curvature 1/2 graphs in H^2 x R.
Finally we construct properly embedded constant mean curvature 1/2 annuli in
H^2 x R.
"
What is the electronic structure of SrRu_(1-x)Ti_xO_3 observed as a function of x?,"  We investigate the evolution of the electronic structure in SrRu_(1-x)Ti_xO_3
as a function of x using high resolution photoemission spectroscopy, where
SrRuO3 is a weakly correlated metal and SrTiO3 is a band insulator. The surface
spectra exhibit a metal-insulator transition at x = 0.5 by opening up a soft
gap. A hard gap appears at higher x values consistent with the transport
properties. In contrast, the bulk spectra reveal a pseudogap at the Fermi
level, and unusual evolution exhibiting an apparent broadening of the coherent
feature and subsequent decrease in intensity of the lower Hubbard band with the
increase in x. Interestingly, the first principle approaches are found to be
sufficient to capture anomalous evolutions at high energy scale. Analysis of
the spectral lineshape indicates strong interplay between disorder and electron
correlation in the electronic properties of this system.
"
What are the parameters that determine the formation of a labyrinthine pattern of bilayer islands?,"  We report on the dewetting of a monolayer on a solid substrate, where mass
transport occurs via surface diffusion. For a wide range of parameters, a
labyrinthine pattern of bilayer islands is formed. An irreversible regime and a
thermodynamic regime are identified. In both regimes, the velocity of a
dewetting front, the wavelength of the bilayer island pattern, and the rate of
nucleation of dewetted zones are obtained. We also point out the existence of a
scaling behavior, which is analyzed by means of a geometrical model.
"
What are the fundamental representations of the supersymmetric pair in the Composite Model?,"  A fermion-boson-type Composite Model is proposed.
  Elementary fields are only one kind of spin-1/2 and spin-0 {\bf preon}. Both
are in the global supersymmetric pair with the common electric charge of e/6
and belong to the fundamental representations of (3, 2, 2) under the
spontaneously unbroken SU(3)_C\otimes{SU(2)}_L^{h}\otimes{SU(2)}_R^{h} gauge
symmetry (h means hyper-color gauge). Preons are composed into subquarks which
are intermediate clusters towards quarks and leptons. Weak interactions are
residual ones of hyper-color gauge interactions. W-and Z-boson are also
composite objects of subquarks, which introduces the idea of existence of their
scalar partners (S) by hyper-fine-splitting whose masses would be around
110-120 GeV. The mechanism of making higher generations is obtained by adding
neutral scalar subquark (y) composed of a preon-antipreon pair. Creation or
annihilation of y inside quarks induces the coupling constants of flavor-mixing
weak interactions which are all complex numbers (contrary to CKM-matrix
elements) and then they all become sources of direct and mixing-induced CP
violations. Exchange of y between quark and anti-quark inside neutral
pseudo-scalar meson (P^0) gives indirect CP violation and mass-difference of
P^0 and P^0. Current experimental results of CP violation (Belle, BaBar, CLEO,
KTeV and NA48) are inspected by this Composite Model. This model suggests the
candidates for Dark Energy and Dark Matter.
"
What are the vector subspaces of the tensor product of two-dimensional gl2-modules?,"  We show that the algebra of commuting Hamiltonians of the homogeneous XXX
Heisenberg model has simple spectrum on the subspace of singular vectors of the
tensor product of two-dimensional $gl_2$-modules. As a byproduct we show that
there exist exactly $\binom {n}{l}-\binom{n}{l-1}$ two-dimensional vector
subspaces $V \subset \C[u]$ with a basis $f,g\in V$ such that $\deg f = l, \deg
g = n-l+1$ and $f(u)g(u-1) - f(u-1)g(u) = (u+1)^n$.
"
What is the combinatorial problem for a family of countable ultrahomogeneous metric spaces?,"  We study the oscillation stability problem for the Urysohn sphere, an analog
of the distortion problem for $\ell_2$ in the context of the Urysohn space
$\Ur$. In particular, we show that this problem reduces to a purely
combinatorial problem involving a family of countable ultrahomogeneous metric
spaces with finitely many distances.
"
What is the relationship between the Hitchin functional and the generalized G2 geometry?,"  We consider the quantization of the effective target space description of
topological M-theory in terms of the Hitchin functional whose critical points
describe seven-manifolds with G2 structure. The one-loop partition function for
this theory is calculated and an extended version of it, that is related to
generalized G2 geometry, is compared with the topological G2 string. We relate
the reduction of the effective action for the extended G2 theory to the Hitchin
functional description of the topological string in six dimensions. The
dependence of the partition functions on the choice of background G2 metric is
also determined.
"
What is the integral and measure theory of the ultraproduct of finite sets?,"  We study the integral and measure theory of the ultraproduct of finite sets.
As a main application we construct limit objects for hypergraph sequences. We
give a new proof for the Hypergraph Removal Lemma and the Hypergraph Regularity
Lemma.
"
What are the main features of the diagrammatic form of the binding potential functional beyond the double-parabola approximation?,"  In our first paper, we showed how a non-local effective Hamiltionian for
short-ranged wetting may be derived from an underlying Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson
model. Here, we combine the Green's function method with standard perturbation
theory to determine the general diagrammatic form of the binding potential
functional beyond the double-parabola approximation for the
Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson bulk potential. The main influence of cubic and quartic
interactions is simply to alter the coefficients of the double parabola-like
zig-zag diagrams and also to introduce curvature and tube-interaction
corrections (also represented diagrammatically), which are of minor importance.
Non-locality generates effective long-ranged many-body interfacial interactions
due to the reflection of tube-like fluctuations from the wall. Alternative wall
boundary conditions (with a surface field and enhancement) and the diagrammatic
description of tricritical wetting are also discussed.
"
What is the impact of dynamic contact patterns on epidemiological dynamics?,"  Contact patterns in populations fundamentally influence the spread of
infectious diseases. Current mathematical methods for epidemiological
forecasting on networks largely assume that contacts between individuals are
fixed, at least for the duration of an outbreak. In reality, contact patterns
may be quite fluid, with individuals frequently making and breaking social or
sexual relationships. Here we develop a mathematical approach to predicting
disease transmission on dynamic networks in which each individual has a
characteristic behavior (typical contact number), but the identities of their
contacts change in time. We show that dynamic contact patterns shape
epidemiological dynamics in ways that cannot be adequately captured in static
network models or mass-action models. Our new model interpolates smoothly
between static network models and mass-action models using a mixing parameter,
thereby providing a bridge between disparate classes of epidemiological models.
Using epidemiological and sexual contact data from an Atlanta high school, we
then demonstrate the utility of this method for forecasting and controlling
sexually transmitted disease outbreaks.
"
What are the conditions under which the set of strong peak functions is a norming subset of a subspace A?,"  Let $C_b(K)$ be the set of all bounded continuous (real or complex) functions
on a complete metric space $K$ and $A$ a closed subspace of $C_b(K)$. Using the
variational method, it is shown that the set of all strong peak functions in
$A$ is dense if and only if the set of all strong peak points is a norming
subset of $A$. As a corollary we show that if $X$ is a locally uniformly
convex, complex Banach space, then the set of all strong peak functions in
$\mathcal{A}(B_X)$ is a dense $G_\delta$ subset. Moreover if $X$ is separable,
smooth and locally uniformly convex, then the set of all norm and numerical
strong peak functions in $\mathcal{A}_u(B_X:X)$ is a dense $G_\delta$ subset.
In case that a set of uniformly strongly exposed points of a (real or complex)
Banach space $X$ is a norming subset of $\mathcal{P}({}^n X)$ for some $n\ge
1$, then the set of all strongly norm attaining elements in $\mathcal{P}({}^n
X)$ is dense, in particular, the set of all points at which the norm of
$\mathcal{P}({}^n X)$ is Fr\'echet differentiable is a dense $G_\delta$ subset.
"
What are the implications of the time dependence of the moduli in a glass forming system?,"  We address the interesting temperature range of a glass forming system where
the mechanical properties are intermediate between those of a liquid and a
solid. We employ an efficient Monte-Carlo method to calculate the elastic
moduli, and show that in this range of temperatures the moduli are finite for
short times and vanish for long times, where `short' and `long' depend on the
temperature. By invoking some exact results from statistical mechanics we offer
an alternative method to compute shear moduli using Molecular Dynamics
simulations, and compare those to the Monte-Carlo method. The final conclusion
is that these systems are not ""viscous fluids"" in the usual sense, as their
actual time-dependence concatenates solid-like materials with varying local
shear moduli.
"
What are the measured values of $2\beta_{\rm eff}$ in $B^0$ decays to $f_0(980)K^0_{\scriptscriptstyle S}$ and $\rho^0(770) K^0_{\scriptscriptstyle S}$?,"  We perform a time-dependent Dalitz plot analysis of $B^0 \to
K^0_{\scriptscriptstyle S}\pi^+\pi^-$ in order to extract the ${CP}$ violation
parameters of $f_0(980) K^0_{\scriptscriptstyle S}$ and $\rho^0(770)
K^0_{\scriptscriptstyle S}$ and direct ${CP}$-asymmetries of $K^{*+}(892)
\pi^-$. The results are obtained from a data sample of $(383\pm3)\times10^{6}$
$B \bar{B}$ decays, collected with the BaBar detector at the PEP2
asymmetric--energy $B$ factory at SLAC. The measured values of $2\beta_{\rm
eff}$ in $B^0$ decays to $f_0(980)K^0_{\scriptscriptstyle S}$ and $\rho^0(770)
K^0_{\scriptscriptstyle S}$ are $(89^{+22}_{-20} \pm 5 \pm 8)^\circ$ and $(37
^{+19}_{-17} \pm 5 \pm 6)^\circ$, respectively, where the first quoted
uncertainty is statistical, the second is systematic and the third is Dalitz
plot signal model uncertainty. We measure the significance of $2\beta_{\rm
eff}(f_0(980)K^0_{\scriptscriptstyle S})\neq 0$ to be $4.3 \sigma$. In decays
to $K^*(892) \pi$ we find $A_{{CP}} = -0.18 \pm 0.10 \pm 0.03 \pm 0.03$. The
measured phase difference between the decay amplitudes of $B^0 \to K^{*+}(892)
\pi^-$ and $\bar{B}^0 \to K^{*-}(892) \pi^+$ is $(-164 \pm 24 \pm 12 \pm
15)^\circ$. All results are preliminary.
"
What are the quantum-gravity effects on the spin dependence of quantum theories?,"  We argue that quantum gravity theories that carry a Lie algebraic
modification of the Poincare' and Heisenberg algebras inevitably provide
inhomogeneities that may serve as seeds for cosmological structure formation.
Furthermore, in this class of theories one must expect a strong polarisation
and spin dependence of various quantum-gravity effects.
"
What is the cause of the asymmetric partitioning of Min proteins between daughter cells in Min systems?,"  Ongoing sub-cellular oscillation of Min proteins is required to block
minicelling in E. coli. Experimentally, Min oscillations are seen in newly
divided cells and no minicells are produced. In model Min systems many daughter
cells do not oscillate following septation because of unequal partitioning of
Min proteins between the daughter cells. Using the 3D model of Huang et al., we
investigate the septation process in detail to determine the cause of the
asymmetric partitioning of Min proteins between daughter cells. We find that
this partitioning problem arises at certain phases of the MinD and MinE
oscillations with respect to septal closure and it persists independently of
parameter variation. At most 85% of the daughter cells exhibit Min oscillation
following septation. Enhanced MinD binding at the static polar and dynamic
septal regions, consistent with cardiolipin domains, does not substantially
increase this fraction of oscillating daughters. We believe that this problem
will be shared among all existing Min models and discuss possible biological
mechanisms that may minimize partitioning errors of Min proteins following
septation.
"
How does the dynamics of a specific element receive influences from any other element of the register?,"  We introduce and formalize the concept of information flux in a many-body
register as the influence that the dynamics of a specific element receive from
any other element of the register. By quantifying the information flux in a
protocol, we can design the most appropriate initial state of the system and,
noticeably, the distribution of coupling strengths among the parts of the
register itself. The intuitive nature of this tool and its flexibility, which
allow for easily manageable numerical approaches when analytic expressions are
not straightforward, are greatly useful in interacting many-body systems such
as quantum spin chains. We illustrate the use of this concept in quantum
cloning and quantum state transfer and we also sketch its extension to
non-unitary dynamics.
"
What mechanisms govern the global regulation of DNA replication in eukaryotes?,"  In eukaryotes, DNA replication is initiated along each chromosome at multiple
sites called replication origins. Locally, each replication origin is
""licensed"", or specified, at the end of the M and the beginning of G1 phases of
the cell cycle. During S phase when DNA synthesis takes place, origins are
activated in stages corresponding to early and late replicating domains. The
staged and progressive activation of replication origins reflects the need to
maintain a strict balance between the number of active replication forks and
the rate at which DNA synthesis procedes. This suggests that origin densities
(frequency of intiation) and replication fork movement (rates of elongation)
must be co-regulated in order to guarantee the efficient and complete
duplication of each subchromosomal domain. Emerging evidence supports this
proposal and suggests that the ATM/ATR intra-S phase checkpoint plays an
important role in the co-regulation of initiation frequencies and rates of
elongation. In the following, we review recent results concerning the
mechanisms governing the global regulation of DNA replication and discuss the
roles these mechanisms play in maintaining genome stability during both a
normal and perturbed S phase.
"
What are the surface plasmon modes in the Casimir effect?,"  In this paper we study the role of surface plasmon modes in the Casimir
effect. The Casimir energy can be written as a sum over the modes of a real
cavity and one may identify two sorts of modes, two evanescent surface plasmon
modes and propagative modes. As one of the surface plasmon modes becomes
propagative for some choice of parameters we adopt an adiabatic mode definition
where we follow this mode into the propagative sector and count it together
with the surface plasmon contribution, calling this contribution ""plasmonic"".
We evaluate analytically the contribution of the plasmonic modes to the Casimir
energy. Surprisingly we find that this becomes repulsive for intermediate and
large mirror separations. The contribution of surface plasmons to the Casimir
energy plays a fundamental role not only at short but also at large distances.
This suggests possibilities to taylor the Casimir force via a manipulation of
the surface plasmons properties.
"
What is the orbital solution for the spectroscopic pair in the multiple star system sigma Scorpii?,"  The first orbital solution for the spectroscopic pair in the multiple star
system sigma Scorpii, determined from measurements with the Sydney University
Stellar Interferometer (SUSI), is presented. The primary component is of beta
Cephei variable type and has been one of the most intensively studied examples
of its class. The orbital solution, when combined with radial velocity results
found in the literature, yields a distance of 174(+23,-18) pc, which is
consistent with, but more accurate than the Hipparcos value. For the primary
component we determine 18.4+/-5.4 M_sun, -4.12+/-0.34 mag and 12.7+/-1.8 R_sun
for the mass, absolute visual magnitude and radius respectively. A B1 dwarf
spectral type and luminosity class for the secondary is proposed from the mass
determination of 11.9+/-3.1 M_sun and the estimated system age of 10 Myr.
"
What is the Hamiltonian formulation for plane-fronted gravitational waves?,"  We construct a Hamiltonian formulation for the class of plane-fronted
gravitational waves with parallel rays (pp-waves). Because of the existence of
a light-like Killing vector, the dynamics is effectively reduced to a 2+1
evolution with ""time"" chosen to be light-like. In spite of the vanishing action
this allows us to geometrically identify a symplectic form as well as dynamical
Hamiltonian, thus casting the system into canonical form.
"
What is the result of the corrected estimate for the low frequency part of the Schrodinger group for a large class of potentials?,"  We prove dispersive estimates for the low frequency part of the Schrodinger
group for a large class of potentials in dimensions greater or equal to four.
As a consequence, we extend the result of Journe, Sofer and Sogge to a larger
class of potentials. In this revised version a mistake in the proof of the
estimate (B.4) is removed.
"
What are the roles of derived categories of small differential graded categories?,"  The Popescu-Gabriel theorem states that each Grothendieck abelian category is
a localization of a module category. In this paper, we prove an analogue where
Grothendieck abelian categories are replaced by triangulated categories which
are well generated (in the sense of Neeman) and algebraic (in the sense of
Keller). The role of module categories is played by derived categories of small
differential graded categories. An analogous result for topological
triangulated categories has recently been obtained by A. Heider.
"
"What is the relationship between the new on-shell methods, 4-dimensional unitarity cuts and on-shell recursions relations, and the Higgs boson and gluons?","  We illustrate the use of new on-shell methods, 4-dimensional unitarity cuts
combined with on-shell recursions relations, by computing the
A_4^{(1)}(phi,1^-,2^-,3^+,4^+) amplitude in the large top mass limit where the
Higgs boson couples to gluons through an effective interaction.
"
How do the initial configuration and local transition rule of a one-dimensional QCA relate to the encoding of the universal QCA?,"  We give a one-dimensional quantum cellular automaton (QCA) capable of
simulating all others. By this we mean that the initial configuration and the
local transition rule of any one-dimensional QCA can be encoded within the
initial configuration of the universal QCA. Several steps of the universal QCA
will then correspond to one step of the simulated QCA. The simulation preserves
the topology in the sense that each cell of the simulated QCA is encoded as a
group of adjacent cells in the universal QCA. The encoding is linear and hence
does not carry any of the cost of the computation. We do this in two flavours:
a weak one which requires an infinite but periodic initial configuration and a
strong one which needs only a finite initial configuration. KEYWORDS: Quantum
cellular automata, Intrinsic universality, Quantum computation.
"
What is the impact of this mechanism on the revenue of the auctioneer?,"  We present a deterministic exploration mechanism for sponsored search
auctions, which enables the auctioneer to learn the relevance scores of
advertisers, and allows advertisers to estimate the true value of clicks
generated at the auction site. This exploratory mechanism deviates only
minimally from the mechanism being currently used by Google and Yahoo! in the
sense that it retains the same pricing rule, similar ranking scheme, as well
as, similar mathematical structure of payoffs. In particular, the estimations
of the relevance scores and true-values are achieved by providing a chance to
lower ranked advertisers to obtain better slots. This allows the search engine
to potentially test a new pool of advertisers, and correspondingly, enables new
advertisers to estimate the value of clicks/leads generated via the auction.
Both these quantities are unknown a priori, and their knowledge is necessary
for the auction to operate efficiently. We show that such an exploration policy
can be incorporated without any significant loss in revenue for the auctioneer.
We compare the revenue of the new mechanism to that of the standard mechanism
at their corresponding symmetric Nash equilibria and compute the cost of
uncertainty, which is defined as the relative loss in expected revenue per
impression. We also bound the loss in efficiency, as well as, in user
experience due to exploration, under the same solution concept (i.e. SNE). Thus
the proposed exploration mechanism learns the relevance scores while
incorporating the incentive constraints from the advertisers who are selfish
and are trying to maximize their own profits, and therefore, the exploration is
essentially achieved via mechanism design. We also discuss variations of the
new mechanism such as truthful implementations.
"
What is the width of the post-shock region in supernovae remnants?,"  We examine the structure of the post-shock region in supernova remnants
(SNRs). The ``shock transition zone'' is set up by charge transfer and
ionization events between atoms and ions, and has a width $\sim 10^{15}$
cm$^{-2}$ $n^{-1}_0$, where $n_0$ is the total pre-shock density (including
both atoms and ions). For Balmer-dominated SNRs with shock velocity $v_s
\gtrsim 1000$ km s$^{-1}$, the Rankine-Hugoniot conditions for ion velocity and
temperature are obeyed instantly, leaving the full width at half-maximum (FWHM)
of the broad H$\alpha$ line versus $v_s$ relation intact. However, the spatial
variation in the post-shock densities is relevant to the problem of Ly$\alpha$
resonant scattering in young, core-collapse SNRs. Both two- (pre-shock atoms
and ions) and three-component (pre-shock atoms, broad neutrals and ions) models
are considered. We compute the spatial emissivities of the broad ($\xi_b$) and
narrow ($\xi_n$) H$\alpha$ lines; a calculation of these emissivities in SN
1006 is in general agreement with the computed ones of Raymond et al. (2007).
The (dimensionless) spatial shift, $\Theta_{\rm{shift}}$, between the centroids
of $\xi_b$ and $\xi_n$ is unique for a given shock velocity and $f_{\rm{ion}}$,
the pre-shock ion fraction. Measurements of $\Theta_{\rm{shift}}$ can be used
to constrain $n_0$.
"
What are the advantages of using the multiple wave packet decomposition method to analyze the phase time?,"  The general and explicit relation between the phase time and the dwell time
for quantum tunneling or scattering is investigated. Considering a symmetrical
collision of two identical wave packets with an one-dimensional barrier, here
we demonstrate that these two distinct transit time definitions give connected
results where, however, the phase time (group delay) accurately describes the
exact position of the scattered particles. The analytical difficulties that
arise when the stationary phase method is employed for obtaining phase
(traversal) times are all overcome. Multiple wave packet decomposition allows
us to recover the exact position of the reflected and transmitted waves in
terms of the phase time, which, in addition to the exact relation between the
phase time and the dwell time, leads to right interpretation for both of them.
"
What are the implications of the Ramsey fringes for the population maximum transfer in Rabi and Ramsey interrogations?,"  The Ramsey fringes formation during the excitation of topological coherent
modes of a Bose-Einstein condensate by an external modulating field is
considered. The Ramsey fringes appear when a series of pulses of the excitation
field is applied. In both Rabi and Ramsey interrogations, there is a shift of
the population maximum transfer due to the strong non-linearity present in the
system. It is found that the Ramsey pattern itself retains information about
the accumulated relative phase between both ground and excited coherent modes.
"
What is the flux ratio of 60Fe to 26Al gamma-rays?,"  Gamma-ray line emission from radioactive decay of 60Fe provides constraints
on nucleosynthesis in massive stars and supernovae. The spectrometer SPI on
board INTEGRAL has accumulated nearly three years of data on gamma-ray emission
from the Galactic plane. We have analyzed these data with suitable
instrumental-background models and sky distributions to produce high-resolution
spectra of Galactic emission. We detect the gamma-ray lines from 60Fe decay at
1173 and 1333 keV, obtaining an improvement over our earlier measurement of
both lines with now 4.9 sigma significance for the combination of the two
lines. The average flux per line is (4.4 \pm 0.9) \times 10^{-5} ph cm^{-2}
s^{-1} rad^{-1} for the inner Galaxy region. Deriving the Galactic 26Al
gamma-ray line flux with using the same set of observations and analysis
method, we determine the flux ratio of 60Fe/26Al gamma-rays as 0.148 \pm 0.06.
The current theoretical predictions are still consistent with our result.
"
What is the cosmological gravitino mass measured by the branching ratio of two decay modes of sleptons?,"  Gauge mediated supersymmetry breaking scenarios with an ultra-light gravitino
of mass m_{3/2}=1-10 eV are very interesting, since there is no cosmological
gravitino problem. We propose a new experimental determination of the gravitino
mass for such an ultra-light gravitino, by measuring a branching ratio of two
decay modes of sleptons.
"
What are the applications of the method to complex systems with rugged energy landscapes?,"  In this paper, we demonstrate the efficiency of simulations via direct
computation of the partition function under various macroscopic conditions,
such as different temperatures or volumes. The method can compute partition
functions by flattening histograms, through the Wang-Landau recursive scheme,
outside the energy space. This method offers a more general and flexible
framework for handling various types of ensembles, especially the ones in which
computation of the density of states is not convenient. It can be easily scaled
to large systems, and it is flexible in incorporating Monte Carlo cluster
algorithms or molecular dynamics. High efficiency is shown in simulating large
Ising models, in finding ground states of simple protein models, and in
studying the liquid-vapor phase transition of a simple fluid. The method is
very simple to implement and we expect it to be efficient in studying complex
systems with rugged energy landscapes, e.g., biological macromolecules.
"
What is the quantum collision model used to predict the magnetic-field dependence of scattering lengths and of near-threshold molecular levels?,"  We discover several magnetic Feshbach resonances in collisions of ultracold
K(39) atoms, by studying atom losses and molecule formation. Accurate
determination of the magnetic-field resonance locations allows us to optimize a
quantum collision model for potassium isotopes. We employ the model to predict
the magnetic-field dependence of scattering lengths and of near-threshold
molecular levels. Our findings will be useful to plan future experiments on
ultracold potassium atoms and molecules.
"
What are the bolometric corrections used in the P-L relations?,"  In this paper we derive semi-empirical Cepheid period-luminosity (P-L)
relations in the Sloan ugriz magnitudes by combining the observed BVI mean
magnitudes from the Large Magellanic Cloud Cepheids (LMC) and theoretical
bolometric corrections. We also constructed empirical gr band P-L relations,
using the publicly available Johnson-Sloan photometric transformations, to be
compared with our semi-empirical P-L relations. These two sets of P-L relations
are consistent with each other.
"
What are the characteristics of the output signal when homodyne detection is used for readout in a region of nonlinear oscillations?,"  We study a novel configuration for displacement detection consisting of a
nanomechanical resonator coupled to both, a radio frequency superconducting
interference device (RF SQUID) and to a superconducting stripline resonator. We
employ an adiabatic approximation and rotating wave approximation and calculate
the displacement sensitivity. We study the performance of such a displacement
detector when the stripline resonator is driven into a region of nonlinear
oscillations. In this region the system exhibits noise squeezing in the output
signal when homodyne detection is employed for readout. We show that
displacement sensitivity of the device in this region may exceed the upper
bound imposed upon the sensitivity when operating in the linear region. On the
other hand, we find that the high displacement sensitivity is accompanied by a
slowing down of the response of the system, resulting in a limited bandwidth.
"
What is the athermal Shear Transformation Zone theory used to understand failure in amorphous materials?,"  The understanding of dynamic failure in amorphous materials via the
propagation of free boundaries like cracks and voids must go beyond elasticity
theory, since plasticity intervenes in a crucial and poorly understood manner
near the moving free boundary. In this Letter we focus on failure via a
cavitation instability in a radially-symmetric stressed material, set up the
free boundary dynamics taking both elasticity and visco-plasticity into
account, using the recently proposed athermal Shear Transformation Zone theory.
We demonstrate the existence (in amorphous systems) of fast cavitation modes
accompanied by extensive plastic deformations and discuss the revealed physics.
"
"What is the evidence of direct electron tunneling across intrinsic insulating regions in sub-micrometer wide bridges of the phase separated ferromagnet (La,Pr,Ca)MnO3)?","  We present evidence of direct electron tunneling across intrinsic insulating
regions in sub-micrometer wide bridges of the phase separated ferromagnet
(La,Pr,Ca)MnO$_3$. Upon cooling below the Curie temperature, a predominantly
ferromagnetic supercooled state persists where tunneling across the intrinsic
tunnel barriers (ITBs) results in metastable, temperature-independent,
high-resistance plateaus over a large range of temperatures. Upon application
of a magnetic field, our data reveal that the ITBs are extinguished resulting
in sharp, colossal, low-field resistance drops. Our results compare well to
theoretical predictions of magnetic domain walls coinciding with the intrinsic
insulating phase.

What is the series $\sum_{n\ge 1}\frac{(\log n)^a}{P(2^n-1)}$ for a constant a<1/2?,"  Let P(k) be the largest prime factor of the positive integer k. In this
paper, we prove that the series $\sum_{n\ge 1}\frac{(\log n)^a}{P(2^n-1)}$ is
convergent for each constant a<1/2, which gives a more precise form of a result
of C. L. Stewart from 1977.
"
What are the processes that could allow the T-odd leptons to be detected in future high energy $e^{+}e^{-}$ colliders?,"  The littlest Higgs model with T-parity predicts the existence of the T-odd
particles, which can only be produced in pair. We consider pair production of
the T-odd leptons in future high energy linear $e^{+}e^{-}$ collider ($ILC$).
Our numerical results show that, as long as the T-odd leptons are not too
heavy, they can be copiously produced and their possible signals might be
detected via the processes $e^{+}e^{-}\to \bar{L}_{i}L_{j}$ in future $ILC$
experiments.
"
What is the solution of the axial-scalar in QED3?,"  To understand the mechanism of the fermion pair and fermion-antifermion pair
condensation,the solutions of Bethe-Salpeter equation in QED$_{3}$ is
examined.In the ladder appoximation our solution for the axial-scalar is
consistent with Ward-Takahashi-identity for the axial vector currents.Since the
massless scalar-vector sector is described by a coupled integral equation,it is
difficult to solve explicitly.We approximate the equation for large and small
momentum region separately and convert them into differential equations in
position space.These equation can be solved easily.Boundary condition at the
origin leads the eigenvalue for dimensionless coupling constant
$\lambda=e^{2}/m$.There exists solutions for massless scalar-vector
fermion-antifermion (fa) system with discrete spectrum. In our approximation
massless-scalar-vector ff systemes does not seem to exist.
"
What is the Hopf algebra structure underlying the renormalization of non-commutative quantum field theory?,"  We contruct here the Hopf algebra structure underlying the process of
renormalization of non-commutative quantum field theory.
"
Can supersymmetry be realized on higher-rank tensors with no propagating degrees of freedom?,"  Recently a correspondence between non-propagating degrees of freedom in
maximal supergravity and the very extended algebra E_11 has been found. We
perform a similar analysis for a supergravity theory with eight supercharges
and very extended G_2. In particular, in the context of d=5 minimal
supergravity, we study whether supersymmetry can be realised on higher-rank
tensors with no propagating degrees of freedom. We find that in this case the
very extended algebra fails to capture these possibilities.
"
What is the polarization of decays involving a $J^{PC}=1^{++}$ $\chi_{c1}$ meson observed in the PEP2 experiment?,"  We perform the first three-dimensional measurement of the amplitudes of $B\to
\psi(2S) K^*$ and $B\to \chi_{c1} K^*$ decays and update our previous
measurement for $B\to J/\psi K^*$. We use a data sample collected with the
BaBar detector at the PEP2 storage ring, corresponding to 232 million $B\bar B$
pairs. The longitudinal polarization of decays involving a $J^{PC}=1^{++}$
$\chi_{c1}$ meson is found to be larger than that with a $1^{--}$ $J/\psi$ or
$\psi(2S)$ meson. No direct {\it CP}-violating charge asymmetry is observed.
"
How do the nonlinear current and rectified current behave in a two-terminal setup of a mesoscopic conductor?,"  We investigate the nonlinear current-voltage characteristic of mesoscopic
conductors and the current generated through rectification of an alternating
external bias. To leading order in applied voltages both the nonlinear and the
rectified current are quadratic. This current response can be described in
terms of second order conductance coefficients and for a generic mesoscopic
conductor they fluctuate randomly from sample to sample. Due to Coulomb
interactions the symmetry of transport under magnetic field inversion is broken
in a two-terminal setup. Therefore, we consider both the symmetric and
antisymmetric nonlinear conductances separately. We treat interactions
self-consistently taking into account nearby gates.
  The nonlinear current is determined by different combinations of second order
conductances depending on the way external voltages are varied away from an
equilibrium reference point (bias mode). We discuss the role of the bias mode
and circuit asymmetry in recent experiments. In a photovoltaic experiment the
alternating perturbations are rectified, and the fluctuations of the nonlinear
conductance are shown to decrease with frequency. Their asymptotical behavior
strongly depends on the bias mode and in general the antisymmetric conductance
is suppressed stronger then the symmetric conductance.
  We next investigate nonlinear transport and rectification in chaotic rings.
To this extent we develop a model which combines a chaotic quantum dot and a
ballistic arm to enclose an Aharonov-Bohm flux. In the linear two-probe
conductance the phase of the Aharonov-Bohm oscillation is pinned while in
nonlinear transport phase rigidity is lost. We discuss the shape of the
mesoscopic distribution of the phase and determine the phase fluctuations.
"
What is the distribution of X in terms of A?,"  If two random variables X and A are functionally related via f(X)=A for some
strictly monotone continuously differentiable function f:R->R, the distribution
of X may easily be computed from the distribution of A.
"
How does the loop variable technique allow the equations of motion for the fields of the open string to be gauge invariant?,"  The exact renormalization group is applied to the world sheet theory
describing bosonic open string backgrounds to obtain the equations of motion
for the fields of the open string. Using loop variable techniques the equations
can be constructed to be gauge invariant. Furthermore they are valid off the
(free) mass shell. This requires keeping a finite cutoff. Thus we have the
interesting situation of a scale invariant world sheet theory with a finite
world sheet cutoff. This is possible because there are an infinite number of
operators whose coefficients can be tuned. This is in the same sense that
""perfect actions"" or ""improved actions"" have been proposed in lattice gauge
theory to reproduce the continuum results even while keeping a finite lattice
spacing.
"
What are the equations of the perturbed conformal invariance conditions of the perturbed curved beta-gamma system?,"  We consider the equations, arising as the conformal invariance conditions of
the perturbed curved beta-gamma system. These equations have the physical
meaning of Einstein equations with a B-field and a dilaton on a hermitian
manifold, where the B-field 2-form is imaginary and proportional to the
canonical form associated with hermitian metric. We show that they decompose
into linear and bilinear equations and lead to the vanishing of the first Chern
class of the manifold where the system is defined. We discuss the relation of
these equations to the generalized Maurer-Cartan structures related to BRST
operator. Finally we describe the relations of the generalized Maurer-Cartan
bilinear operation and the Courant/Dorfman brackets.
"
What is the behavior of plasma instabilities in quark-gluon plasmas in heavy-ion collisions?,"  Thermalization of quark-gluon plasmas in heavy-ion collisions is a difficult
theoretical problem. One theoretical goal has been to understand the physics of
thermalization in the relatively simplifying limit of arbitrarily high energy
collisions, where the running coupling alpha_s is weak. One of the current
roadblocks to achieving this goal is lack of knowledge about the behavior of
plasma instabilities when particle distributions are highly anisotropic. In
particular, it has not been known how the magnetic fields generated by plasma
instabilities scale with anisotropy. In this paper, we use numerical
simulations in a first attempt to determine this scaling.
"
What are the silicate emission features observed in the debris disk around beta Pictoris?,"  We have obtained Spitzer IRS 5.5 - 35 micron spectroscopy of the debris disk
around beta Pictoris. In addition to the 10 micron silicate emission feature
originally observed from the ground, we also detect the crystalline silicate
emission bands at 28 micron and 33.5 micron. This is the first time that the
silicate bands at wavelengths longer than 10 micron have ever been seen in the
beta Pictoris disk. The observed dust emission is well reproduced by a dust
model consisting of fluffy cometary and crystalline olivine aggregates. We
searched for line emission from molecular hydrogen and atomic [S I], Fe II, and
Si II gas but detected none. We place a 3 sigma upper limit of <17 Earth masses
on the H2 S(1) gas mass, assuming an excitation temperature of Tex = 100 K.
This suggests that there is less gas in this system than is required to form
the envelope of Jupiter. We hypothesize that some of the atomic Na I gas
observed in Keplerian rotation around beta Pictoris may be produced by
photon-stimulated desorption from circumstellar dust grains.
"
What is the volume-weighted probability measure for eternal inflation?,"  An improved volume-weighted probability measure for eternal inflation is
proposed. For the models studied in this paper it leads to simple and
intuitively expected gauge-invariant results.
"
"What is the relationship between the three categories of things we know, don't know, and don't know that we don't know that we don't know that we don't know?","  Donald Rumsfeld, in attempting to excuse the inexcusable, once (in)famously
said that ``there are things that we know we know; there are things that we
know we don't know; and then there are things that we don't know that we don't
know"". Recent discoveries about hadrons with heavy flavours fall into those
categories. It is of course the third category that is the most tantalising,
but lessons from the first two may help resolve the third.
"
What is the relationship between a field K and the transcendence degree of its extended center in the case of a prime K-algebra of quadratic growth?,"  Let $K$ be a field and let $A$ be a finitely generated prime $K$-algebra. We
generalize a result of Smith and Zhang, showing that if $A$ is not PI and does
not have a locally nilpotent ideal, then the extended centre of $A$ has
transcendence degree at most ${\rm GKdim}(A)-2$ over $K$. As a consequence, we
are able to show that if $A$ is a prime $K$-algebra of quadratic growth, then
either the extended centre is a finite extension of K or $A$ is PI. Finally, we
give an example of a finitely generated non-PI prime $K$-algebra of GK
dimension 2 with a locally nilpotent ideal such that the extended centre has
infinite transcendence degree over $K$.
"
What is the Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno algorithm used to minimize the distance between the numerical solutions of the Fokker-Planck equation and the empirical probability density functions?,"  An improved method for the description of hierarchical complex systems by
means of a Fokker-Planck equation is presented. In particular the
limited-memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno algorithm for constraint
problems (L-BFGS-B) is used to minimize the distance between the numerical
solutions of the Fokker-Planck equation and the empirical probability density
functions and thus to estimate properly the drift and diffusion term of the
Fokker-Planck equation. The optimisation routine is applied to a time series of
velocity measurements obtained from a turbulent helium gas jet in order to
demonstrate the benefits and to quantify the improvements of this new
optimisation routine.
"
Can a strong magnetic field suppress other MHD instabilities in the flow?,"  We study the stability of a compressible magnetic plane Couette flow and show
that compressibility profoundly alters the stability properties if the magnetic
field has a component perpendicular to the direction of flow. The necessary
condition of a newly found instability can be satisfied in a wide variety of
flows in laboratory and astrophysical conditions. The instability can operate
even in a very strong magnetic field which entirely suppresses other MHD
instabilities. The growth time of this instability can be rather short and
reach $\sim 10$ shear timescales.
"
What are the key factors that affect the wrinkle orientation and amplitude of polymer films?,"  Wrinkling patterns at the metallized surface of thin polymer films are shown
to be sensitive to the sticky or slippery character of the polymer/substrate
interface (titanium coating, polystyrene film and coated silicon substrate).
Selective prefered wrinkle orientation and amplitude are achieved. Existing
theoretical models are expanded to specific boundary conditions (adhesive vs
slippery) and rationalize these observations.
"
What are the unique properties of water that are required for life-giving processes?,"  Water is necessary both for the evolution of life and its continuance. It
possesses particular properties that cannot be found in other materials and
that are required for life-giving processes. These properties are brought about
by the hydrogen bonded environment particularly evident in liquid water. Each
liquid water molecule is involved in about four hydrogen bonds with strengths
considerably less than covalent bonds but considerably greater than the natural
thermal energy. These hydrogen bonds are roughly tetrahedrally arranged such
that when strongly formed the local clustering expands, decreasing the density.
Such low density structuring naturally occurs at low and supercooled
temperatures and gives rise to many physical and chemical properties that
evidence the particular uniqueness of liquid water. If aqueous hydrogen bonds
were actually somewhat stronger then water would behave similar to a glass,
whereas if they were weaker then water would be a gas and only exist as a
liquid at sub-zero temperatures. The overall conclusion of this investigation
is that water's hydrogen bond strength is poised centrally within a narrow
window of its suitability for life.
"
What is the effect of supramolecular organisation on the resonance energy transfer rates in nanoassemblies?,"  We present time-resolved photoluminescence measurements on two series of
oligo-p-phenylenevinylene materials that self-assemble into supramolecular
nanostructures with thermotropic reversibility in dodecane. One set of
derivatives form chiral, helical stacks while the second set form less
organised, frustrated stacks. Here we study the effects of supramolecular
organisation on the resonance energy transfer rates. We measure these rates in
nanoassemblies formed with mixed blends of oligomers and compare them with the
rates predicted by Foerster theory. Our results and analysis show that control
of supramolecular order in the nanometre lengthscale has a dominant effect on
the efficiency and dimentionality of resonance energy transfer.
"
What are the conditions limiting the crystallization and phase transformations?,"  We present a simple unifying model for crystallization and melting
temperatures by showing that homogeneous nucleation and phase transformations
driven by thickening of pre-existing surface layers are limiting conditions of
the more general heterogeneous nucleation case. Furthermore, to a first
approximation all these processes can be described by an extended classical
nucleation theory. The model can also be applied to phase transition
temperatures in confined volumes, provided reliable values for the interfacial
tensions within the systems are determinable. The expected melting and
crystallization temperature for any transformation pathway can then be
predicted.
"
What is the algorithm to list all triangulations of closed surfaces with at most a fixed number of vertices?,"  We describe some theoretical results on triangulations of surfaces and we
develop a theory on roots, decompositions and genus-surfaces. We apply this
theory to describe an algorithm to list all triangulations of closed surfaces
with at most a fixed number of vertices. We specialize the theory for the case
where the number of vertices is at most 11 and we get theoretical restrictions
on genus-surfaces allowing us to get the list of triangulations of closed
surfaces with at most 11 vertices.
"
What are the implications of the existence of plasma oscillations of electrons-positron pairs for the study of field strengths E < Ec?,"  We evidence the existence of plasma oscillations of electrons-positron pairs
created by the vacuum polarization in an uniform electric field with E < Ec.
Our general treatment, encompassing also the traditional, well studied case of
E > Ec, shows the existence in both cases of a maximum Lorentz factor acquired
by electrons and positrons and allows determination of the a maximal length of
oscillation. We quantitatively estimate how plasma oscillations reduce the rate
of pair creation and increase the time scale of the pair production. These
results are particularly relevant in view of the experimental progress in
approaching the field strengths E < Ec.
"
"How does a physics blog or ""blog"" impact students' attitudes towards the value of physics?","  Even though there has been a tremendous amount of research done in how to
help students learn physics, students are still coming away missing a crucial
piece of the puzzle: why bother with physics? Students learn fundamental laws
and how to calculate, but come out of a general physics course without a deep
understanding of how physics has transformed the world around them. In other
words, they get the ""how"" but not the ""why"". Studies have shown that students
leave introductory physics courses almost universally with decreased
expectations and with a more negative attitude. This paper will detail an
experiment to address this problem: a course weblog or ""blog"" which discusses
real-world applications of physics and engages students in discussion and
thinking outside of class. Specifically, students' attitudes towards the value
of physics and its applicability to the real-world were probed using a
26-question Likert scale survey over the course of four semesters in an
introductory physics course at a comprehensive Jesuit university. We found that
students who did not participate in the blog study generally exhibited a
deterioration in attitude towards physics as seen previously. However, students
who read, commented, and were involved with the blog maintained their initially
positive attitudes towards physics. Student response to the blog was
overwhelmingly positive, with students claiming that the blog made the things
we studied in the classroom come alive for them and seem much more relevant.
"
What is the hypersurface $S_{k}^{i}$ and how is it related to the rational curve?,"  Let $K$ be a field, $a, b\in K$ and $ab\neq 0$. Let us consider the
polynomials $g_{1}(x)=x^n+ax+b, g_{2}(x)=x^n+ax^2+bx$, where $n$ is a fixed
positive integer. In this paper we show that for each $k\geq 2$ the
hypersurface given by the equation \begin{equation*} S_{k}^{i}:
u^2=\prod_{j=1}^{k}g_{i}(x_{j}),\quad i=1, 2. \end{equation*} contains a
rational curve. Using the above and Woestijne's recent results \cite{Woe} we
show how one can construct a rational point different from the point at
infinity on the curves $C_{i}:y^2=g_{i}(x), (i=1, 2)$ defined over a finite
field, in polynomial time.
"
What are the implications of the distribution of avalanche event durations?,"  We probe the dynamics of intermittent avalanches caused by steady addition of
grains to a quasi-two dimensional heap. To characterize the time-dependent
average avalanche flow speed v(t), we image the top free surface. To
characterize the grain fluctuation speed dv(t), we use Speckle-Visibility
Spectroscopy. During an avalanche, we find that the fluctuation speed is
approximately one-tenth the average flow speed, and that these speeds are
largest near the beginning of an event. We also find that the distribution of
event durations is peaked, and that event sizes are correlated with the time
interval since the end of the previous event. At high rates of grain addition,
where successive avalanches merge into smooth continuous flow, the relationship
between average and fluctuation speeds changes to dv Sqrt[v].
"
What is the effect of potential change on the pair creation in a time-dependent potentials?,"  We give here the proof that pair creation in a time dependent potentials is
possible. It happens with probability one if the potential changes
adiabatically in time and becomes overcritical, that is when an eigenvalue
enters the upper spectral continuum. The potential may be assumed to be zero at
large negative and positive times. The rigorous treatment of this effect has
been lacking since the pioneering work of Beck, Steinwedel and Suessmann in
1963 and Gershtein and Zeldovich in 1970.
"
What are the principal geometric features that control the long-time dynamics of many-body systems?,"  In principle, all of the dynamical complexities of many-body systems are
encapsulated in the potential energy landscapes on which the atoms move - an
observation that suggests that the essentials of the dynamics ought to be
determined by the geometry of those landscapes. But what are the principal
geometric features that control the long-time dynamics? We suggest that the key
lies not in the local minima and saddles of the landscape, but in a more global
property of the surface: its accessible pathways. In order to make this notion
more precise we introduce two ideas: (1) a switch to a new ensemble that
removes the concept of potential barriers from the problem, and (2) a way of
finding optimum pathways within this new ensemble. The potential energy
landscape ensemble, which we describe in the current paper, regards the maximum
accessible potential energy, rather than the temperature, as a control
variable. We show here that while this approach is thermodynamically equivalent
to the canonical ensemble, it not only sidesteps the idea of barriers, it
allows us to be quantitative about the connectivity of a landscape. We
illustrate these ideas with calculations on a simple atomic liquid and on the
Kob-Andersen model of a glass-forming liquid, showing, in the process, that the
landscape of the Kob-Anderson model appears to have a connectivity transition
at the landscape energy associated with its mode-coupling transition. We turn
to the problem of finding the most efficient pathways through potential energy
landscapes in our companion paper.
"
What are the lower bounds on the network's pre-log based on a linear partial-cancellation scheme?,"  We study the high-power asymptotic behavior of the sum-rate capacity of
multi-user interference networks with an equal number of transmitters and
receivers. We assume that each transmitter is cognizant of the message it
wishes to convey to its corresponding receiver and also of the messages that a
subset of the other transmitters wish to send. The receivers are assumed not to
be able to cooperate in any way so that they must base their decision on the
signal they receive only. We focus on the network's pre-log, which is defined
as the limiting ratio of the sum-rate capacity to half the logarithm of the
transmitted power. We present both upper and lower bounds on the network's
pre-log. The lower bounds are based on a linear partial-cancellation scheme
which entails linearly transforming Gaussian codebooks so as to eliminate the
interference in a subset of the receivers. Inter alias, the bounds give a
complete characterization of the networks and side-information settings that
result in a full pre-log, i.e., in a pre-log that is equal to the number of
transmitters (and receivers) as well as a complete characterization of networks
whose pre-log is equal to the full pre-log minus one. They also fully
characterize networks where the full pre-log can only be achieved if each
transmitter knows the messages of all users, i.e., when the side-information is
""full"".
"
How does the conformational gel graphics account for the interplay of molecular mechanics and NMR data constraints on the population estimates?,"  Conformational gel analysis and graphics systematically identifies and
evaluates plausible alternatives to the side chain conformations found by
conventional peptide or protein structure determination methods. The proposed
analysis determines the populations of side chain rotational isomers and the
probability distribution of these populations. The following steps are repeated
for each side chain of a peptide or protein: first, extract the local molecular
mechanics of side chain rotational isomerization from a single representative
global conformation; second, expand the predominant set of rotational isomers
to include all probable rotational isomers down to those that constitute just a
small percentage of the population; and third, evaluate the constraints vicinal
coupling constants and NOESY cross relaxation rates place on rotational isomer
populations. In this article we apply conformational gel analysis to the cobalt
glycyl-leucine dipeptide and detail the steps necessary to generalize the
analysis to other amino acid side chains in other peptides and proteins. For a
side chain buried within a protein interior, it is noteworthy that the set of
probable rotational isomers may contain one or more rotational isomers that are
not identified by conventional NMR structure determination methods. In cases
such as this the conformational gel graphics fully accounts for the interplay
of molecular mechanics and NMR data constraints on the population estimates.
The analysis is particularly suited to identifying side chain rotational
isomers that constitute a small percentage of the population, but nevertheless
might be structurally and functionally very significant.
"
What is the relation between the time-dependent quantum Monte Carlo and stochastic quantization methods?,"  We examine the relation between the recently proposed time-dependent quantum
Monte Carlo (TDQMC) method and the principles of stochastic quantization. In
both TDQMC and stochastic quantization particle motion obeys stochastic
guidance equations to preserve quantum equilibrium. In this way the probability
density of the Monte Carlo particles corresponds to the modulus square of the
many-body wave function at all times. However, in TDQMC the motion of particles
and guide waves occurs in physical space unlike in stochastic quantization
where it occurs in configuration space. Hence the practical calculation of time
evolution of many-body fully correlated quantum systems becomes feasible within
the TDQMC methodology. We illustrate the TDQMC technique by calculating the
symmetric and antisymmetric ground state of a model one-dimensional Helium
atom, and the time evolution of the dipole moment when the atom is irradiated
by a strong ultrashort laser pulse.
"
What is the origin of the peculiar temperature behavior of the infrared mode around 710 cm-1?,"  We present measurements of the infrared response of the quasi-one-dimensional
organic conductor (TMTSF)2$SO3 along (E||a) and perpendicular (E||b') to the
stacking axis as a function of temperature. Above the metal-insulator
transition related to the anion ordering the optical conductivity spectra show
a Drude-like response. Below the transition an energy gap of about 1500 cm-1
(185 meV) opens, leading to the corresponding charge transfer band in the
optical conductivity spectra. The analysis of the infrared-active vibrations
gives evidence for the long-range crystal structure modulation below the
transition temperature and for the short-range order fluctuations of the
lattice modulation above the transition temperature. Also we report about a new
infrared mode at around 710 cm-1 with a peculiar temperature behavior, which
has so far not been observed in any other (TMTSF)2X salt showing a
metal-insulator transition. A qualitative model based on the coupling between
the TMTSF molecule vibration and the reorientation of electrical dipole moment
of the FSO3 anion is proposed, in order to explain the anomalous behavior of
the new mode.

"What are the properties of the automorphism group of a symmetric (81,16,3) design?","  In this paper we study the automorphism group of a possible symmetric
$(81,16,3)$ design.
"
What are the examples of exciting science produced by recent wide field surveys?,"  I review the status of science with wide field surveys. For many decades
surveys have been the backbone of astronomy, and the main engine of discovery,
as we have mapped the sky at every possible wavelength. Surveys are an
efficient use of resources. They are important as a fundamental resource; to
map intrinsically large structures; to gain the necessary statistics to address
some problems; and to find very rare objects. I summarise major recent wide
field surveys - 2MASS, SDSS, 2dfGRS, and UKIDSS - and look at examples of the
exciting science they have produced, covering the structure of the Milky Way,
the measurement of cosmological parameters, the creation of a new field
studying substellar objects, and the ionisation history of the Universe. I then
look briefly at upcoming projects in the optical-IR survey arena - VISTA,
PanSTARRS, WISE, and LSST. Finally I ask, now we have opened up essentially all
wavelength windows, whether the exploration of survey discovery space is ended.
I examine other possible axes of discovery space, and find them mostly to be
too expensive to explore or otherwise unfruitful, with two exceptions : the
first is the time axis, which we have only just begun to explore properly; and
the second is the possibility of neutrino astrophysics.

"What is the significance of the new methanol masers at 9.9, 25 and 104 GHz for the search for new sources of energetic conditions in the interface regions of molecular outflows?","  The Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) and the Mopra facility have been
used to search for new southern class I methanol masers at 9.9, 25 (J=5) and
104 GHz, which are thought to trace more energetic conditions in the interface
regions of molecular outflows, than the widespread class I masers at 44 and 95
GHz. One source shows a clear outflow association.
"
What is the connection between the Belinsky-Khalatnikov-Lifshitz-like structure and the Belinsky-Khalatnikov-Lifshitz-like structure?,"  We review the recently discovered connection between the
Belinsky-Khalatnikov-Lifshitz-like ``chaotic'' structure of generic
cosmological singularities in eleven-dimensional supergravity and the ``last''
hyperbolic Kac-Moody algebra E(10). This intriguing connection suggests the
existence of a hidden ``correspondence'' between supergravity (or even
M-theory) and null geodesic motion on the infinite-dimensional coset space
K(E(10)). If true, this gravity/coset correspondence would offer a new view of
the (quantum) fate of space (and matter) at cosmological singularities.
"
"What is the range of the scaled momentum, $\xp$, of charged final state hadrons measured in deep-inelastic $\ep$ scattering?","  The average charged track multiplicity and the normalised distribution of the
scaled momentum, $\xp$, of charged final state hadrons are measured in
deep-inelastic $\ep$ scattering at high $Q^2$ in the Breit frame of reference.
The analysis covers the range of photon virtuality $100 < Q^2 < 20 000
\GeV^{2}$. Compared with previous results presented by HERA experiments this
analysis has a significantly higher statistical precision and extends the phase
space to higher $Q^{2}$ and to the full range of $\xp$. The results are
compared with $e^+e^-$ annihilation data and with various calculations based on
perturbative QCD using different models of the hadronisation process.
"
What are the implications of the momentum independence of quark masses in AdS/CFT?,"  Heavy quark jet quenching in nuclear collisions at LHC is predicted and
compared using the classical gravity AdS/CFT correspondence and Standard Model
perturbative QCD. The momentum independence and inverse quark mass dependence
of the drag coefficient in AdS/CFT differs substantially from the
characteristic log(pT/M)/pT variation of the drag in QCD. We propose that the
measurement of the momentum dependence of the double ratio of the nuclear
modification factors of charm and bottom jets is a robust observable that can
be used to search for strong coupling deviations from perturbative QCD
predictions.
"
What are the implications of the three agent game for social models where a player can be favored or disfavored for advancement?,"  We study the dynamics and resulting score distribution of three-agent games
where after each competition a single agent wins and scores a point. A single
competition is described by a triplet of numbers $p$, $t$ and $q$ denoting the
probabilities that the team with the highest, middle or lowest accumulated
score wins. We study the full family of solutions in the regime, where the
number of agents and competitions is large, which can be regarded as a
hydrodynamic limit. Depending on the parameter values $(p,q,t)$, we find six
qualitatively different asymptotic score distributions and we also provide a
qualitative understanding of these results. We checked our analytical results
against numerical simulations of the microscopic model and find these to be in
excellent agreement. The three agent game can be regarded as a social model
where a player can be favored or disfavored for advancement, based on his/her
accumulated score. It is also possible to decide the outcome of a three agent
game through a mini tournament of two-a gent competitions among the
participating players and it turns out that the resulting possible score
distributions are a subset of those obtained for the general three agent-games.
We discuss how one can add a steady and democratic decline rate to the model
and present a simple geometric construction that allows one to write down the
corresponding score evolution equations for $n$-agent games.
"
"What is the structure of the order parameter in a rotating, two-component Bose-Einstein condensate?","  A rotating, two-component Bose-Einstein condensate is shown to exhibit
vortices of multiple quantization, which are possible due to the interatomic
interactions between the two species. Also, persistent currents are absent in
this system. Finally, the order parameter has a very simple structure for a
range of angular momenta.
"
What is the natural statistical interpretation of the eigenvalue statistics in the orthogonal symmetry class?,"  Quantum systems with discrete symmetries can usually be desymmetrized, but
this strategy fails when considering transport in open systems with a symmetry
that maps different openings onto each other. We investigate the joint
probability density of transmission eigenvalues for such systems in
random-matrix theory. In the orthogonal symmetry class we show that the
eigenvalue statistics manifests level repulsion between only every second
transmission eigenvalue. This finds its natural statistical interpretation as a
staggeredsuperposition of two eigenvalue sequences. For a large number of
channels, the statistics for a system with a lead-transposing symmetry
approaches that of a superposition of two uncorrelated sets of eigenvalues as
in systems with a lead-preserving symmetry (which can be desymmetrized). These
predictions are confirmed by numerical computations of the
transmission-eigenvalue spacing distribution for quantum billiards and for the
open kicked rotator.

What are the implications of the Eckart choice of the velocity field for relativistic fluids?,"  Causality and stability in relativistic dissipative hydrodynamics are
important conceptual issues. We argue that causality is not restricted to
hyperbolic set of differential equations. E.g. heat conduction equation can be
causal considering the physical validity of the theory. Furthermore we propose
a new concept of relativistic internal energy that clearly separates the
dissipative and non-dissipative effects. We prove that with this choice we
remove all known instabilities of the linear response approximation of viscous
and heat conducting relativistic fluids. In this paper the Eckart choice of the
velocity field is applied.
"
What are the basic scientific arguments behind the contention that solar variations are a significant factor in driving climate change?,"  The sun's role in the earth's recent warming remains controversial even
though there is a good deal of evidence to support the thesis that solar
variations are a very significant factor in driving climate change both
currently and in the past. This precis lays out the background and data needed
to understand the basic scientific argument behind the contention that
variations in solar output have a significant impact on current changes in
climate. It also offers a simple, phenomenological approach for estimating the
actual-as opposed to model dependent-magnitude of the sun's influence on
climate.
"
What are the noncommutative analogues of a theorem about isometries between subspaces of Lp-spaces?,"  We prove some noncommutative analogues of a theorem by Plotkin and Rudin
about isometries between subspaces of Lp-spaces. Let 0<p<\infty, p not an even
integer. The main result of this paper states that in the category of unital
subspaces of noncommutative probability Lp-spaces, under some boundedness
condition, the unital completely isometric maps come from *-isomorphisms of the
underlying von Neumann algebras.
  Some applications are given, including to non commutative H^p spaces.
"
What is the neutrino mass formula used to derive a simple neutrino mass sum rule?,"  A two-parameter neutrino mass formula is described, giving a moderately
hierarchical spectrum m_1 < m_2 < m_3 consistent with the experimental
estimates of Delta m^2_{21} and Delta m^2_{32}. The formula follows from a
three-parameter empirical neutrino mass formula through imposing a parameter
constraint and leads to a very simple neutrino mass sum rule m_3 = 18 m_2 - 48
m_1. Some alternative parameter constraints, used tentatively to eliminate one
of three parameters, are compared.
"
What are the implications of the Boltzmann term in the kinetic equation?,"  A system of generalized kinetic equations for the distribution functions of
two-dimensional Dirac fermions scattered by impurities is derived in the Born
approximation with respect to short-range impurity potential. It is proven that
the conductivity following from classical Boltzmann equation picture, where
electrons or holes have scattering amplitude reduced due chirality, is
justified except for an exponentially narrow range of chemical potential near
the conical point. When in this range, creation of infinite number of
electron-hole pairs related to quasi-relativistic nature of electrons in
graphene results in a renormalization of minimal conductivity as compared to
the Boltzmann term and logarithmic corrections in the conductivity similar to
the Kondo effect.
"
What is the physical interpretation of the dynamical and inhomogeneous spherically symmetric solution for a scalar field with an exponential potential?,"  We discuss the physical interpretation of a dynamical and inhomogeneous
spherically symmetric solution obtained by Fonarev for a scalar field with an
exponential potential. There is a single parameter $w$ in the solution which
can be set to $\pm1$ if it is non-zero, in addition to the steepness parameter
$\lambda$ in the potential. The spacetime is conformally static and
asymptotically flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker spacetime. The solution reduces
to the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker solution for $w=0$. There are two curvature
singularities, of which one is a timelike central singularity and the other is
a big-bang or big-crunch type singularity. Depending on the parameters, the
spacetime can possess a future outer trapping horizon in the collapsing case.
Then the solution represents a dynamical black hole in the sense of Hayward
although there is a locally naked singularity at the center and no black-hole
event horizon. This demonstrates a weak point of the local definition of a
black hole in terms of a trapping horizon.
"
What are the key findings on how people manage their digital belongings?,"  We conducted a preliminary field study to understand the current state of
personal digital archiving in practice. Our aim is to design a service for the
long-term storage, preservation, and access of digital belongings by examining
how personal archiving needs intersect with existing and emerging archiving
technologies, best practices, and policies. Our findings not only confirmed
that experienced home computer users are creating, receiving, and finding an
increasing number of digital belongings, but also that they have already lost
irreplaceable digital artifacts such as photos, creative efforts, and records.
Although participants reported strategies such as backup and file replication
for digital safekeeping, they were seldom able to implement them consistently.
Four central archiving themes emerged from the data: (1) people find it
difficult to evaluate the worth of accumulated materials; (2) personal storage
is highly distributed both on- and offline; (3) people are experiencing
magnified curatorial problems associated with managing files in the aggregate,
creating appropriate metadata, and migrating materials to maintainable formats;
and (4) facilities for long-term access are not supported by the current
desktop metaphor. Four environmental factors further complicate archiving in
consumer settings: the pervasive influence of malware; consumer reliance on ad
hoc IT providers; an accretion of minor system and registry inconsistencies;
and strong consumer beliefs about the incorruptibility of digital forms, the
reliability of digital technologies, and the social vulnerability of networked
storage.
"
What are the implications of epsilon-near zero materials for confining energy in a subwavelength cavity with gigantic field enhancement?,"  In this work, we investigate the detailed theory of the supercoupling,
anomalous tunneling effect, and field confinement originally identified in [M.
Silveirinha, N. Engheta, Phys. Rev. Lett. 97, 157403, (2006)], where we
demonstrated the possibility of using materials with permittivity near zero to
drastically improve the transmission of electromagnetic energy through a narrow
irregular channel with very subwavelength transverse cross-section. Here, we
present additional physical insights, describe new applications of the
tunneling effect in relevant waveguide scenarios (e.g., the ""perfect"" or
""super"" waveguide coupling), study the effect of metal losses in the metallic
walls, and the possibility of using epsilon-near zero materials to confine
energy in a subwavelength cavity with gigantic field enhancement. In addition,
we systematically study the propagation of electromagnetic waves through narrow
channels filled with anisotropic epsilon-near zero materials. It is
demonstrated that these materials may have interesting potentials, and that for
some particular geometries the reflectivity of the channel is independent of
the specific dimensions or parameters of epsilon-near zero transition. We also
describe several realistic metamaterial implementations of the studied
problems, based on standard metallic waveguides, microstrip line
configurations, and wire media.
"
What is the path decomposition technique used to study dissipation in a free particle passing through a rectangular potential barrier?,"  Quantum transmissions of a free particle passing through a rectangular
potential barrier with dissipation are studied using a path decomposition
technique. Dissipative processes strongly suppress the transmission probability
at resonance just above the barrier resulting in an unexpected reduction of the
mean traversal time through the potential barrier.
"
What is the connection between noncommutative gauge theory and matrix models and fluid mechanical systems?,"  We review the connection between noncommutative gauge theory, matrix models
and fluid mechanical systems. The noncommutative Chern-Simons description of
the quantum Hall effect and bosonization of collective fermion states are used
as specific examples.
"
What are the electronic structures of PTCDA and NTCDA?,"  The PTCDA (3,4,9,10-Perylene-tetracarboxylic dianhydride) and the NTCDA
(1,4,5,8-Naphtalenetetracarboxylic dianhydride) are aromatic, stable, planar
and highly symmetric with unusual electrical properties. The PTCDA is a
semiconductor organic crystalline of particular interest due to its excellent
properties and electronic potential that are used in optoelectronic devices and
the NTCDA it is monoclinic and its space group is similar to that of the PTCDA.
Recently, alternate layers of PTCDA and NTCDA were growth forming multiple
structures of quantum wells showing a new class of materials with new optic
lineal properties. Some have assured that their big utilities would be centered
in the construction of diodes and of possible guides of waves. We have carried
out calculations semi-empirical of the electronic structures and of optic
properties of the PTCDA and of the NTCDA that show us that they are structures
highly orderly polymeric, semiconductors in a negative load state (charge
state= -2)
"
What is the mechanism of molecular motors in the intermediate regime?,"  Conformational transitions in macromolecular complexes often involve the
reorientation of lever-like structures. Using a simple theoretical model, we
show that the rate of such transitions is drastically enhanced if the lever is
bendable, e.g. at a localized ""hinge''. Surprisingly, the transition is fastest
with an intermediate flexibility of the hinge. In this intermediate regime, the
transition rate is also least sensitive to the amount of ""cargo'' attached to
the lever arm, which could be exploited by molecular motors. To explain this
effect, we generalize the Kramers-Langer theory for multi-dimensional barrier
crossing to configuration dependent mobility matrices.
"
What is the importance of many-body effects in the Fourier transformed local density of states of d-wave superconductors?,"  We illustrate the importance of many-body effects in the Fourier transformed
local density of states (FT-LDOS) of d-wave superconductors from a model of
electrons coupled to an Einstein mode with energy Omega_0. For bias energies
significantly larger than Omega_0 the quasiparticles have short lifetimes due
to this coupling, and the FT-LDOS is featureless if the electron-impurity
scattering is treated within the Born approximation. In this regime it is
important to include boson exchange for the electron-impurity scattering which
provides a `step down' in energy for the electrons and allows for long
lifetimes. This many-body effect produces qualitatively different results,
namely the presence of peaks in the FT-LDOS which are mirrors of the
quasiparticle interference peaks which occur at bias energies smaller than ~
Omega_0. The experimental observation of these quasiparticle mirages would be
an important step forward in elucidating the role of many-body effects in
FT-LDOS measurements.
"
What are the mechanisms for the origin of the peculiar velocity of the microquasar GRS 1915+105?,"  The space velocity of a stellar black hole encodes the history of its
formation and evolution. Here we measure the 3-dimensional motion of the
microquasar GRS 1915+105, using a decade of astrometry with the NRAO Very Long
Baseline Array, together with the published radial velocity. The velocity in
the Galactic Plane deviates from circular rotation by 53-80 +_ 8 km/s, where
the range covers any specific distance from 6-12 kpc. Perpendicular to the
plane, the velocity is only 10 +_ 4 km/s. The peculiar velocity is minimized at
a distance 9-10 kpc, and is then nearly in the radial direction towards the
Galactic Center. We discuss mechanisms for the origin of the peculiar velocity,
and conclude that it is most likely a consequence of Galactic velocity
diffusion on this old binary, rather than the result of a supernova kick during
the formation of the 14 Mo black hole. Finally, a brief comparison is made with
4 other BH binaries whose kinematics are well determined.
"
What is the relation between the spin wave modes and the saturation magnetization?,"  This is a condensed exposition of the results of a future work, based on a
talk of the second author at the Oberwolfach workshop ""Poisson Geometry"", April
30--4 May 2007.
"
What is the relationship between the dynamical mean field theory and the local spectral densities of the one- and two-particle response functions?,"  We present dynamical mean field theory (DMFT) results for the local spectral
densities of the one- and two-particle response functions for the infinite
dimensional Hubbard model in a magnetic field. We look at the different regimes
corresponding to half-filling, near half-filling and well away from
half-filling, for intermediate and strong values of the local interaction $U$.
The low energy results are analyzed in terms of quasiparticles with field
dependent parameters. The renormalized parameters are determined by two
different methods, both based on numerical renormalization group (NRG)
calculations, and we find good agreement. Away from half-filling the
quasiparticle weights, $z_\sigma(H)$, differ according to the spin type
$\sigma=\uparrow$ or $\sigma=\downarrow$. Using the renormalized parameters, we
show that DMFT-NRG results for the local longitudinal and transverse dynamic
spin susceptibilities in an arbitrary field can be understood in terms of
repeated scattering of these quasiparticles. We also check Luttinger's theorem
for the Hubbard model and find it to be satisfied in all parameter regimes and
for all values of the magnetic field.
"
What are the current-voltage characteristics of the quantum dot?,"  Motivated by a recent experiment on nonlinear tunneling in a suspended Carbon
nanotube connected to two normal electrodes [S. Sapmaz, {\it et al}., Phys.
Rev. Lett. {\bf 96}, 26801 (2006)], we investigate nonequilibrium
vibration-mediated sequential tunneling through a molecular quantum dot with
two electronic orbitals asymmetrically coupled to two electrodes and strongly
interacting with an internal vibrational mode, which is itself weakly coupled
to a dissipative phonon bath. For this purpose, we establish rate equations
using a generic quantum Langevin equation approach. Based on these equations,
we study in detail the current-voltage characteristics and zero-frequency shot
noise, paying special attention to the advanced or postponed of the appearance
of negative differential conductance and super-Poissonian current noise
resulting from electron-phonon-coupling induced {\em selective unidirectional
cascades of single-electron transitions}.
"
What are the properties of random Boolean networks and their attractors?,"  This review explains in a self-contained way the properties of random Boolean
networks and their attractors, with a special focus on critical networks. Using
small example networks, analytical calculations, phenomenological arguments,
and problems to solve, the basic concepts are introduced and important results
concerning phase diagrams, numbers of relevant nodes and attractor properties
are derived.
"
What are the implications of the short distance singularity on the number of counter-terms?,"  The renormalization of the NN interaction with the Chiral Two Pion Exchange
Potential computed using relativistic baryon chiral perturbation theory is
considered. The short distance singularity reduces the number of counter-terms
to about a half as those in the heavy-baryon expansion. Phase shifts and
deuteron properties are evaluated and a general overall agreement is observed.
"
What are the theoretical predictions for the mean extension of a polymer along the force axis as a function of the force f?,"  Force induced stretching of polymers is important in a variety of contexts.
We have used theory and simulations to describe the response of homopolymers,
with $N$ monomers, to force ($f$) in good and poor solvents. In good solvents
and for {{sufficiently large}} $N$ we show, in accord with scaling predictions,
that the mean extension along the $f$ axis $<Z>\sim f$ for small $f$, and
$<Z>\sim f^{{2/3}}$ (the Pincus regime) for intermediate values of $f$. The
theoretical predictions for $\la Z\ra$ as a function of $f$ are in excellent
agreement with simulations for N=100 and 1600. However, even with N=1600, the
expected Pincus regime is not observed due to the the breakdown of the
assumptions in the blob picture for finite $N$. {{We predict the Pincus scaling
in a good solvent will be observed for $N\gtrsim 10^5$}}. The force-dependent
structure factors for a polymer in a poor solvent show that there are a
hierarchy of structures, depending on the nature of the solvent. For a weakly
hydrophobic polymer, various structures (ideal conformations, self-avoiding
chains, globules, and rods) emerge on distinct length scales as $f$ is varied.
A strongly hydrophobic polymer remains globular as long as $f$ is less than a
critical value $f_c$. Above $f_c$, an abrupt first order transition to a
rod-like structure occurs. Our predictions can be tested using single molecule
experiments.
"
What is the Very Large Array (VLA) used to search for radio emission from a globular cluster G1?,"  We have used the Very Large Array (VLA) to search for radio emission from the
globular cluster G1 (Mayall-II) in M31. G1 has been reported by Gebhardt et al.
to contain an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) with a mass of ~2 x 10^4
solar masses. Radio emission was detected within an arcsecond of the cluster
center with an 8.4 GHz power of 2 x 10^{15} W/Hz. The radio/X-ray ratio of G1
is a few hundred times higher than that expected for a high-mass X-ray binary
in the cluster center, but is consistent with the expected value for accretion
onto an IMBH with the reported mass. A pulsar wind nebula is also a possible
candidate for the radio and X-ray emission from G1; future high-sensitivity
VLBI observations might distinguish between this possibility and an IMBH. If
the radio source is an IMBH, and similar accretion and outflow processes occur
for hypothesized ~ 1000-solar-mass black holes in Milky Way globular clusters,
they are within reach of the current VLA and should be detectable easily by the
Expanded VLA when it comes on line in 2010.
"
What is the global solution of the Cahn-Hilliard equation with Wentzell boundary condition?,"  In this paper we consider the Cahn-Hilliard equation endowed with Wentzell
boundary condition which is a model of phase separation in a binary mixture
contained in a bounded domain with permeable wall. Under the assumption that
the nonlinearity is analytic with respect to unknown dependent function, we
prove the convergence of a global solution to an equilibrium as time goes to
infinity by means of a suitable \L ojasiewicz-Simon type inequality with
boundary term. Estimates of convergence rate are also provided.
"
What is the gauge theory that incorporates gravity in the (0+1)-dimensional limit?,"  A new kind of gauge theory is introduced, where the minimal coupling and
corresponding covariant derivatives are defined in the space of functions
pertaining to the functional Schroedinger picture of a given field theory.
While, for simplicity, we study the example of a U(1) symmetry, this kind of
gauge theory can accommodate other symmetries as well. We consider the
resulting relativistic nonlinear extension of quantum mechanics and show that
it incorporates gravity in the (0+1)-dimensional limit, similar to recently
studied Schroedinger-Newton equations. Gravity is encoded here into a universal
nonlinear extension of quantum theory. A probabilistic interpretation (Born's
rule) holds, provided the underlying model is scale free.
  Keywords: nonlinear functional Schroedinger equation, gauge symmetry,
Newtonian gravity.
"
What is the relationship between Lyapunov stability and Hopf bifurcation in a biological system?,"  In this paper we study the Lyapunov stability and Hopf bifurcation in a
biological system which models the biological control of parasites of orange
plantations.
"
What are the main differences between the distribution of total radio intensity and polarized radio intensity in the galaxy NGC4254?,"  Radio observations can show how cluster galaxies are affected by various
environmental factors. We made three frequency radio-polarimetric VLA
observations and performed sensitive XMM-Newton observations in X-rays and UV
light of NGC4254. The distribution of total radio intensity at 8.46 4.86 GHz
reveals a global asymmetry with a more diffuse and almost two times larger
extension to the north than to the south. The radio polarized intensity is even
more asymmetric, showing a strange bright ridge in the southern disk edge,
displaced to the downstream side of the local density wave. Magnetic arms can
be also seen in other disk portions, mostly avoiding nearby optical spiral
arms. Spatially resolved emission of hot X-ray gas from the whole galactic
disk, with its soft component closely tracing star-forming regions, is
detected. The slope of the local radio nonthermal-infrared relation is <1, thus
smaller than for the radio thermal-infrared one (>1). Using the radio thermal
emission-based star formation rate (SFR) we find higher extinction in more
Halpha luminous star-forming regions with a power-law slope of 0.83. The
galaxy's estimated mean SFR of 0.026 M_sun/yr/kpc^2 is three times larger than
in other spirals of similar Hubble type. NGC4254 seems to belong to the class
of `young' Virgo cluster members, which recently experienced a gravitational
encounter at the cluster's periphery, which perturbed its spiral arms by tidal
forces and triggered a burst of star-formation which still maintains strong
radio and infrared emissions. Tidal forces could also sheared the magnetic
field in the southern disk portion and led to the observed polarized ridge,
though, magnetic field compression by weak ram pressure forces of the cluster
gas cannot be excluded.
"
What are the implications of the tiny error bars in the sigma-meson mass and width?,"  I. Caprini's, G. Colangelo's, and H. Leutwyler's (CCL) article ""Mass and
Width of the Lowest Resonance in QCD"", Phys. Rev. Lett. 96, 132001 (2006)
[hep-ph/0512364], is critically reviewed. The present comment is devoted to
complement a recent experimental discussion (D.V. Bugg, J. Phys. G 34, 151
(2007) [hep-ph/0608081]) of short-comings in the CCL analysis, by presenting
theoretical arguments pointing at a serious flaw in the theoretical formalism
used by CCL, and also at the unlikeliness of their tiny error bars in the
sigma-meson mass and width. The criticism made in the comment applies
analogously to the analysis on the kappa-meson mass performed in the article
""The K0*(800) scalar resonance from Roy-Steiner representations of pi K
scattering"" published as S. Descotes-Genon and B. Moussallam, Eur. Phys. J. C
48, 553 (2006) [hep-ph/0607133].

"What are the properties of the C-loops obtained from the right(left) derivative, $a^{-1},e-$ and $e,a^{-1}-$ isotopes of a C-loop?","  The right(left) derivative, $a^{-1},e-$ and $e,a^{-1}-$ isotopes of a C-loop
are shown to be C-loops. Furthermore, for a central loop $(L,F)$, it is shown
that $\big\{F,F^{a^{-1}},F_{a^{-1},e}\big\}$ and
$\big\{F,F_{a^{-1}},F_{e,a^{-1}}\big\}$ are systems of isotopic C-loops that
obey a form of generalized distributive law. Quasigroup isotopes $(L,\otimes)$
and $(L,\ominus)$ of a loop $(L,\theta)$ and its parastrophe $(L,\theta ^*)$
respectively are proved to be isotopic if either $(L,\otimes)$ or $(L,\ominus
)$ is commutative. If $(L,\theta)$ is a C-loop, then it is shown that
$\big\{(L,\theta),(L,\theta ^*),(L,\otimes),(L,\oplus)\big\}$ is a system of
isotopic C-quasigroup under the above mentioned condition. It is shown that
C-loops are isotopic to some finite indecomposable groups of the classes ${\cal
D}_i,i=1,2,3,4,5$ and that the center of such C-loops have a rank of 1,2 or 3.
"
What are the implications of the observed flat spectra of TeV blazars for the upper limits on the near infrared extragalactic background radiation?,"  The observed spectra of blazars, their intrinsic emission, and the underlying
populations of radiating particles are intimately related. The use of these
sources as probes of the extragalactic infrared background, a prospect
propelled by recent advances in TeV-band telescopes, soon to be augmented by
observations by NASA's upcoming Gamma-Ray Large Area Space Telescope (GLAST),
has been a topic of great recent interest. Here, it is demonstrated that if
particles in blazar jets are accelerated at relativistic shocks, then gamma-ray
spectra with indices less than 1.5 can be produced. This, in turn, loosens the
upper limits on the near infrared extragalactic background radiation previously
proposed. We also show evidence hinting that TeV blazars with flatter spectra
have higher intrinsic TeV gamma-ray luminosities and we indicate that there may
be a correlation of flatness and luminosity with redshift.
"
What are the implications of perturbative stability in string theory for the existence of spacetime fermions?,"  Is perturbative stability intimately tied with the existence of spacetime
fermions in string theory in more than two dimensions? Type 0'B string theory
in ten-dimensional flat space is a rare example of a non-tachyonic,
non-supersymmetric string theory with a purely bosonic closed string spectrum.
However, all known type 0' constructions exhibit massless NSNS tadpoles
signaling the fact that we are not expanding around a true vacuum of the
theory. In this note, we are searching for perturbatively stable examples of
type 0' string theory without massless tadpoles in backgrounds with a spatially
varying dilaton. We present two examples with this property in non-critical
string theories that exhibit four- and six-dimensional Poincare invariance. We
discuss the D-branes that can be embedded in this context and the type of gauge
theories that can be constructed in this manner. We also comment on the
embedding of these non-critical models in critical string theories and their
holographic (Little String Theory) interpretation and propose a general
conjecture for the role of asymptotic supersymmetry in perturbative string
theory.
"
What is the Lovasz extension of a pseudo-Boolean function?,"  The Lovasz extension of a pseudo-Boolean function $f : \{0,1\}^n \to R$ is
defined on each simplex of the standard triangulation of $[0,1]^n$ as the
unique affine function $\hat f : [0,1]^n \to R$ that interpolates $f$ at the
$n+1$ vertices of the simplex. Its degree is that of the unique multilinear
polynomial that expresses $f$. In this paper we investigate the least squares
approximation problem of an arbitrary Lovasz extension $\hat f$ by Lovasz
extensions of (at most) a specified degree. We derive explicit expressions of
these approximations. The corresponding approximation problem for
pseudo-Boolean functions was investigated by Hammer and Holzman (1992) and then
solved explicitly by Grabisch, Marichal, and Roubens (2000), giving rise to an
alternative definition of Banzhaf interaction index. Similarly we introduce a
new interaction index from approximations of $\hat f$ and we present some of
its properties. It turns out that its corresponding power index identifies with
the power index introduced by Grabisch and Labreuche (2001).
"
How can the LSDA picture be improved by the GW approach?,"  Using the local spin-density approximation (LSDA) and the (non
self-consistent) GW approach, the (quasi-particle) band structure is calculated
for MnTe in zinc-blende geometry. Different parameters characterizing the
electronic structure are computed for an antiferromagnetic and the
ferromagnetic phase and compared with the experiment. The strong Hubbard-type
repulsion on the Mn-3d orbitals and the p-d hybridization are seen to be
responsible for substantial defects found in the LSDA picture. It is discussed
to which extent these can be improved upon by means of the GW approach.
"
What are the curvature components in the free-falling frame for a spherically-symmetric truly naked black hole?,"  We demonstrate the existence of spherically-symmetric truly naked black holes
(TNBH) for which the Kretschmann scalar is finite on the horizon but some
curvature components including those responsible for tidal forces as well as
the energy density $\bar{\rho}$ measured by a free-falling observer are
infinite. We choose a rather generic power-like asymptotics for the metric
functions and analyze possible types of a horizon depending on the behavior of
curvature components in the free-falling frame. It is also shown in a general
case of distorted black holes that $\bar{\rho}$ and tidal forces are either
both finite or both infinite. The general approach developed in the article
includes previously found examples and, in particular, TNBHs with an infinite
area of a horizon. The fact that the detection of singularity depends on a
frame may be relevant for a more accurate definition of the cosmic censorship
conjecture. TNBHs may be considered as a new example of so-called non-scalar
singularities for which the scalar curvature invariants are finite but some
components of the Riemann tensor may diverge in certain frames.
"
What is the main X-ray property of the Seyfert 1.8 galaxy ESO113-G010 observed during the 2005 XMM-Newton follow-up?,"  (Abridged) We present here a long (100ks) XMM-Newton follow-up of the Seyfert
1.8 galaxy ESO113-G010 performed in November 2005, in order to study over a
longer time-scale its main X-ray properties. The source was found in a
higher/softer time-averaged flux state, and timing analysis of this source
reveals strong, rapid variability. The Power Spectral Density (PSD) analysis
indicates (at 95% c.l.) a break at 3.7 x 10^-4 Hz. This cut-off frequency is
comparable to those measured in some other rapidly-variable Seyferts, such as
MCG-6-30-15 and NGC4051. From the mass-luminosity-time-scale, we infer that
M_BH ranges from 4 x 10^6 - 10^7 M_odot and the source is accreting at or close
to the Eddington rate (or even higher). The existing data cannot distinguish
between spectral pivoting of the continuum and a two-component origin for the
spectral softening, primarily because the data do not span a broad enough flux
range. In the case of the two-component model, the fractional offsets measured
in the flux-flux plots increase significantly toward higher energies (similar
to what is observed in MCG-6-30-15) as expected if there exists a constant
reflection component. Contrary to May 2001, no significant highly redshifted
emission line is observed (which might be related to the source flux level),
while two narrow emission lines at about 6.5keV and 7keV are observed. The S/N
is not high enough to establish if the lines are variable or constant. As
already suggested by the 2001 observation, no significant constant narrow
6.4keV FeK line (EW~32eV) is observed, hence excluding any dominant emission
from distant cold matter such as a torus in this Seyfert type 1.8 galaxy.
"
What is the relationship between the Einstein equations and a general matter model?,"  We consider the spherically symmetric, asymptotically flat Einstein-Vlasov
system. We find explicit conditions on the initial data, with ADM mass M, such
that the resulting spacetime has the following properties: there is a family of
radially outgoing null geodesics where the area radius r along each geodesic is
bounded by 2M, the timelike lines $r=c\in [0,2M]$ are incomplete, and for r>2M
the metric converges asymptotically to the Schwarzschild metric with mass M.
The initial data that we construct guarantee the formation of a black hole in
the evolution. We also give examples of such initial data with the additional
property that the solutions exist for all $r\geq 0$ and all Schwarzschild time,
i.e., we obtain global existence in Schwarzschild coordinates in situations
where the initial data are not small. Some of our results are also established
for the Einstein equations coupled to a general matter model characterized by
conditions on the matter quantities.
"
What is the design of the $^{87}$Rb atomic source for high precision dual atom interferometry?,"  We present a compact $^{87}$Rb atomic source for high precision dual atom
interferometers. The source is based on a double-stage magneto-optical trap
(MOT) design, consisting of a 2-dimensional (2D)-MOT for efficient loading of a
3D-MOT. The accumulated atoms are precisely launched in a horizontal moving
molasses. Our setup generates a high atomic flux ($>10^{10}$ atoms/s) with
precise and flexibly tunable atomic trajectories as required for high
resolution Sagnac atom interferometry. We characterize the performance of the
source with respect to the relevant parameters of the launched atoms, i.e.
temperature, absolute velocity and pointing, by utilizing time-of-flight
techniques and velocity selective Raman transitions.
"
What are the normalizers of irreducible subfactors arising from subgroup--group inclusions H of G?,"  We consider normalizers of an irreducible inclusion $N\subseteq M$ of
$\mathrm{II}_1$ factors. In the infinite index setting an inclusion
$uNu^*\subseteq N$ can be strict, forcing us to also investigate the semigroup
of one-sided normalizers. We relate these normalizers of $N$ in $M$ to
projections in the basic construction and show that every trace one projection
in the relative commutant $N'\cap < M,e_N>$ is of the form $u^*e_Nu$ for some
unitary $u\in M$ with $uNu^*\subseteq N$. This enables us to identify the
normalizers and the algebras they generate in several situations. In particular
each normalizer of a tensor product of irreducible subfactors is a tensor
product of normalizers modulo a unitary. We also examine normalizers of
irreducible subfactors arising from subgroup--group inclusions $H\subseteq G$.
Here the normalizers are the normalizing group elements modulo a unitary from
$L(H)$. We are also able to identify the finite trace $L(H)$-bimodules in
$\ell^2(G)$ as double cosets which are also finite unions of left cosets.
"
What are the foliation of a foliated submanifold S of C^n?,"  We discuss various problems regarding the structure of the foliation of some
foliated submanifolds S of C^n, in particular Levi flat ones. As a general
scheme, we suppose that S is bounded along a coordinate (or a subset of
coordinates), and prove that the leaves of its foliation are complex planes.
"
What is the purpose of the hydrodynamical simulations of low mass protoplanets in circumbinary accretion disks?,"  We present the results of hydrodynamical simulations of low mass protoplanets
embedded in circumbinary accretion disks. The aim is to examine the migration
and long term orbital evolution of the protoplanets, in order to establish the
stability properties of planets that form in circumbinary disks. Simulations
were performed using a grid--based hydrodynamics code. First we present a set
of calculations that study how a binary interacts with a circumbinary disk. We
evolve the system for 10^5 binary orbits, which is the time needed for the
system to reach a quasi-equilibrium state. From this time onward the apsidal
lines of the disk and the binary are aligned, and the binary eccentricity
remains essentially unchanged with a value of e_b ~ 0.08. Once this stationary
state is obtained, we embed a low mass protoplanet in the disk and let it
evolve under the action of the binary and disk forces. We consider protoplanets
with masses of 5, 10 and 20 Earth masses. In each case, we find that inward
migration of the protoplanet is stopped at the edge of the tidally truncated
cavity formed by the binary. This effect is due to positve corotation torques,
which can counterbalance the net negative Lindblad torques in disk regions
where the surface density profile has a sufficiently large positive gradient.
Halting of migration occurs in a region of long-term stability, suggesting that
low mass circumbinary planets may be common, and that gas giant circumbinary
planets should be able to form in circumbinary disks.
"
Can collisionless shock waves be driven in unmagnetized electron-positron plasmas?,"  It is shown that collisionless shock waves can be driven in unmagnetized
electron-positron plasmas by performing a two-dimensional particle-in-cell
simulation. At the shock transition region, strong magnetic fields are
generated by a Weibel-like instability. The generated magnetic fields are
strong enough to deflect the incoming particles from upstream of the shock at a
large angle and provide an effective dissipation mechanism for the shock. The
structure of the collisionless shock propagates at an almost constant speed.
There is no linear wave corresponding to the shock wave and therefore this can
be regarded as a kind of ``instability-driven'' shock wave. The generated
magnetic fields rapidly decay in the downstream region. It is also observed
that a fraction of the thermalized particles in the downstream region return
upstream through the shock transition region. These particles interact with the
upstream incoming particles and cause the generation of charge-separated
current filaments in the upstream of the shock as well as the electrostatic
beam instability. As a result, electric and magnetic fields are generated even
upstream of the shock transition region. No efficient acceleration processes of
particles were observed in our simulation.
"
What are the error rates and power of some multi-stage regression methods?,"  This paper explores the following question: what kind of statistical
guarantees can be given when doing variable selection in high-dimensional
models? In particular, we look at the error rates and power of some multi-stage
regression methods. In the first stage we fit a set of candidate models. In the
second stage we select one model by cross-validation. In the third stage we use
hypothesis testing to eliminate some variables. We refer to the first two
stages as ""screening"" and the last stage as ""cleaning."" We consider three
screening methods: the lasso, marginal regression, and forward stepwise
regression. Our method gives consistent variable selection under certain
conditions.
"
What are the kinetic approaches to describe the process of particle acceleration at shock fronts?,"  Kinetic approaches provide an effective description of the process of
particle acceleration at shock fronts and allow to take into account the
dynamical reaction of the accelerated particles as well as the amplification of
the turbulent magnetic field as due to streaming instability. The latter does
in turn affect the maximum achievable momentum and thereby the acceleration
process itself, in a chain of causality which is typical of non-linear systems.
Here we provide a technical description of two of these kinetic approaches and
show that they basically lead to the same conclusions. In particular we discuss
the effects of shock modification on the spectral shape of the accelerated
particles, on the maximum momentum, on the thermodynamic properties of the
background fluid and on the escaping and advected fluxes of accelerated
particles.
"
What is the Brillouin zone of a ferromagnet with finite size?,"  We present a new high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission study of
1\textit{T}-TiSe$_{2}$ in both, its room-temperature, normal phase and its
low-temperature, charge-density wave phase. At low temperature the
photoemission spectra are strongly modified, with large band renormalisations
at high-symmetry points of the Brillouin zone and a very large transfer of
spectral weight to backfolded bands. A theoretical calculation of the spectral
function for an excitonic insulator phase reproduces the experimental features
with very good agreement. This gives strong evidence in favour of the excitonic
insulator scenario as a driving force for the charge-density wave transition in
1\textit{T}-TiSe$_{2}$.
"
What are the signatures of states from each dot in a ferromagnet with finite size?,"  We present an advanced lateral triple quantum dot made by local anodic
oxidation. Three dots are coupled in a starlike geometry with one lead attached
to each dot thus allowing for multiple path transport measurements with two
dots per path. In addition charge detection is implemented using a quantum
point contact. Both in charge measurements as well as in transport we observe
clear signatures of states from each dot. Resonances of two dots can be
established allowing for serial transport via the corresponding path. Quadruple
points with all three dots in resonance are prepared for different electron
numbers and analyzed concerning the interplay of the simultaneously measured
transport along both paths.
"
What are the applications of optical microresonators in lithium niobate?,"  Optical microresonators have recently attracted a growing attention in the
photonics community. Their applications range from quantum electro-dynamics to
sensors and filtering devices for optical telecommunication systems, where they
are likely to become an essential building block. The integration of nonlinear
and electro-optical properties in the resonators represents a very stimulating
challenge, as it would incorporate new and more advanced functionality. Lithium
niobate is an excellent candidate material, being an established choice for
electro-optic and nonlinear optical applications. Here we report on the first
realization of optical microring resonators in submicrometric thin films of
lithium niobate. The high index contrast films are produced by an improved
crystal ion slicing and bonding technique using benzocyclobutene. The rings
have radius R=100 um and their transmission spectrum has been tuned using the
electro-optic effect. These results open new perspectives for the use of
lithium niobate in chip-scale integrated optical devices and nonlinear optical
microcavities.
"
What is the complement of Gabriel's theorem for indecomposable representations of quivers on separable Hilbert spaces?,"  We study indecomposable representations of quivers on separable
infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces by bounded operators. We consider a
complement of Gabriel's theorem for these representations. Let $\Gamma$ be a
finite, connected quiver. If its underlying undirected graph contains one of
extended Dynkin diagrams $\tilde{A_n} (n \geq 0)$, $\tilde{D_n} (n \geq 4)$,
$\tilde{E_6}$,$\tilde{E_7}$ and $\tilde{E_8}$, then there exists an
indecomposable representation of $\Gamma$ on separable infinite-dimensional
Hilbert spaces.
"
How are the generating functions for the number of similarity classes for all finite quotients of the ring computed?,"  In this paper similarity classes of three by three matrices over a local
principal ideal commutative ring are analyzed. When the residue field is
finite, a generating function for the number of similarity classes for all
finite quotients of the ring is computed explicitly.
"
What are the implications of the asymptotic analysis of ordinary differential equations for the Einstein equations for a spherically symmetric fluid?,"  Based on the asymptotic analysis of ordinary differential equations, we
classify all spherically symmetric self-similar solutions to the Einstein
equations which are asymptotically Friedmann at large distances and contain a
perfect fluid with equation of state $p=(\gamma -1)\mu$ with $0<\gamma<2/3$.
This corresponds to a ``dark energy'' fluid and the Friedmann solution is
accelerated in this case due to anti-gravity. This extends the previous
analysis of spherically symmetric self-similar solutions for fluids with
positive pressure ($\gamma>1$). However, in the latter case there is an
additional parameter associated with the weak discontinuity at the sonic point
and the solutions are only asymptotically ``quasi-Friedmann'', in the sense
that they exhibit an angle deficit at large distances. In the $0<\gamma<2/3$
case, there is no sonic point and there exists a one-parameter family of
solutions which are {\it genuinely} asymptotically Friedmann at large
distances. We find eight classes of asymptotic behavior: Friedmann or
quasi-Friedmann or quasi-static or constant-velocity at large distances,
quasi-Friedmann or positive-mass singular or negative-mass singular at small
distances, and quasi-Kantowski-Sachs at intermediate distances. The
self-similar asymptotically quasi-static and quasi-Kantowski-Sachs solutions
are analytically extendible and of great cosmological interest. We also
investigate their conformal diagrams. The results of the present analysis are
utilized in an accompanying paper to obtain and physically interpret numerical
solutions.
"
What is the Josephson effect in a one-dimensional Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid?,"  AC Josephson effect in one-dimensional Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid (TLL)
adiabatically connected to superconducting electrodes is theoretically
investigated. It is found that density fluctuations due to repulsive
electron-electron interactions in TLL inhibit Josephson oscillations, whereas
they do not affect time-independent current part. We also show that the
fluctuations reduce supercurrent noise caused by multiple Andreev reflections.
This indicates that the quantum fluctuations in TLL disturb the superconducting
phase coherence spreading across the junction.
"
How can the differences in Raman spectra between magmatic and metamorphic zircons be used to identify the genesis of zircons and understand the origin and evolution history of their parent rocks?,"  The magmatic and metamorphic zircons were investigated with Raman spectrum
microprobe analysis. We found notable differences between these two kinds of
zircons exhibited by the variation trend of Raman peak intensity from core to
rim of a crystal. In magmatic zircons, the intensity and the ratio H/W of Raman
spectrum peaks gradually decrease from core to rim of a crystal, which is
produced by an increase in metamictization degree and suggests an increase in U
and Th concentrations from core to rim. In metamorphic zircons, there are two
kinds of crystals according to their Raman spectra: the first group of zircons
exhibits a variation trend opposite to those of magmatic zircons, tending to
increase in the Raman peak intensity and H/W value from core to rim of a
crystal, which is produced by a decrease in metamictization degree and
indicates a decrease of U and Th concentrations from core to rim of a crystal.
The second group of zircons exhibits no change in Raman peak intensity and H/W
value through a crystal. The data of infrared and Raman spectra of these
crystals show that they are well crystallized and have no lattice destruction
induced by metamictization, and are thought to crystallize in high temperature
stages of metamorphism. During these stages, the U and Th ions have been
removed by metamorphic fluids from the parent rocks of these zircons. The other
difference between magmatic and metamorphic zircons is the background level of
their Raman spectra, which is high and sloped in magmatic zircons, but low and
horizontal in metamorphic zircons. The differences between magmatic and
metamorphic zircons can be used to identify the genesis of zircons and
understand the origin and evolution history of their parent rocks.
"
What is the relationship between the quenching factors and the saturation phenomenon in scintillation light?,"  We observe that the pattern of the quenching factors for scintillation light
from various ions, recently studied in $CaWO_4$ in connection with dark matter
detectors, can be understood as a saturation phenomenon in which the light
output is simply proportional to track length, independent of the ion and its
energy. This observation is in accord with the high dE/dx limit of Birks' law.
It suggests a simple model for the intrinsic resolution of light detectors for
low energy ions, which we briefly discuss.
"
How do the results of the diquark spectator model affect the prediction for the azimuthal asymmetries in unpolarized SIDIS and DY-processes?,"  The naive time reversal odd (``T-odd'') parton distribution $h_{1}^{\perp}$,
the so-called Boer-Mulders function, for both up ($u$) and down ($d$) quarks is
considered in the diquark spectator model. While the results of different
articles in the literature suggest that the signs of the Boer-Mulders function
in semi-inclusive DIS for both flavors $u$ and $d$ are the same and negative, a
previous calculation in the diquark-spectator model found that
$h_{1}^{\perp(u)}$ and $h_{1}^{\perp(d)}$ have different signs. The flavor
dependence is of significance for the analysis of the azimuthal $\cos(2\phi)$
asymmetries in unpolarized SIDIS and DY-processes, as well as for the overall
physical understanding of the distribution of transversely polarized quarks in
unpolarized nucleons. We find substantial differences with previous work. In
particular we obtain half and first moments of Boer-Mulders function that are
negative over the full range in Bjorken $x$ for both the $u$- and $d$- quarks.
In conjunction with the Collins function we then predict the $\cos(2\phi)$
azimuthal asymmetry for $\pi^{+}$ and $\pi^{-}$ in this framework. We also find
that the Sivers $u$- and $d$- quark are negative and positive respectively. As
a by-product of the formalism, we calculate the chiral-odd but ``T-even''
function $h_{1L}^{\perp}$, which allows us to present a prediction for the
single spin asymmetry $A_{UL}^{\sin(2\phi)}$ for a longitudinally polarized
target in SIDIS.
"
What are the results of the first-principles calculations for the absorption and emission spectra of silicon nanocrystals?,"  The absorption and emission spectra of silicon nanocrystals up to 1 nm
diameter including geometry optimization and the many-body effects induced by
the creation of an electron-hole pair have been calculated within a
first-principles framework. Starting from hydrogenated silicon clusters of
different size, different Si/O bonding at the cluster surface have been
considered. We found that the presence of a Si-O-Si bridge bond originates
significative excitonic luminescence features in the visible range that are in
fair agreement with the experimental outcomes.
"
What is the relationship between the v2 and jet suppression in the context of the equation of state (EoS) of hot dense matter at RHIC?,"  A critical discussion of the present signals for the phase transition to
quark-gluon plasma (QGP) is given. Since hadronic rescattering models predict
much larger flow than observed from 1 to 50 A GeV laboratory bombarding
energies, this observation is interpreted as potential evidence for a
first-order phase transition at high baryon density. A detailed discussion of
the collective flow as a barometer for the equation of state (EoS) of hot dense
matter at RHIC follows. Here, hadronic rescattering models can explain < 30 %
of the observed elliptic flow v_2 for $p_T > 2$ GeV/c. This is interpreted as
an evidence for the production of superdense matter at RHIC. The connection of
v_2 to jet suppression is examined. A study of Mach shocks generated by fast
partonic jets propagating through the QGP is given. The main goal is to take
into account different types of collective motion during the formation and
evolution of this matter. A significant deformation of Mach shocks in central
Au+Au collisions at RHIC and LHC energies as compared to the case of jet
propagation in a static medium is predicted. A new hydrodynamical study of jet
energy loss is presented.
"
What are the key heuristics for automatic layout for quantum circuits?,"  We present a computer-aided design flow for quantum circuits, complete with
automatic layout and control logic extraction. To motivate automated layout for
quantum circuits, we investigate grid-based layouts and show a performance
variance of four times as we vary grid structure and initial qubit placement.
We then propose two polynomial-time design heuristics: a greedy algorithm
suitable for small, congestion-free quantum circuits and a dataflow-based
analysis approach to placement and routing with implicit initial placement of
qubits. Finally, we show that our dataflow-based heuristic generates better
layouts than the state-of-the-art automated grid-based layout and scheduling
mechanism in terms of latency and potential pipelinability, but at the cost of
some area.
"
What are the phases of the algorithm?,"  An algorithm is developed to compute the complete CS decomposition (CSD) of a
partitioned unitary matrix. Although the existence of the CSD has been
recognized since 1977, prior algorithms compute only a reduced version (the
2-by-1 CSD) that is equivalent to two simultaneous singular value
decompositions. The algorithm presented here computes the complete 2-by-2 CSD,
which requires the simultaneous diagonalization of all four blocks of a unitary
matrix partitioned into a 2-by-2 block structure. The algorithm appears to be
the only fully specified algorithm available. The computation occurs in two
phases. In the first phase, the unitary matrix is reduced to bidiagonal block
form, as described by Sutton and Edelman. In the second phase, the blocks are
simultaneously diagonalized using techniques from bidiagonal SVD algorithms of
Golub, Kahan, and Demmel. The algorithm has a number of desirable numerical
features.
"
"What are the exchange interactions in the spin-trimer compounds Ca3Cu3-xNix(PO4)4 (x=0,1,2) described by the Heisenberg model?","  Inelastic neutron scattering experiments were performed for the spin-trimer
compounds Ca3Cu3-xNix(PO4)4 (x=0,1,2) in order to study the dynamic magnetic
properties. The observed excitations can be associated with transitions between
the low-lying electronic states of linear Cu-Cu-Cu, Cu-Cu-Ni, and Ni-Cu-Ni
trimers which are the basic constituents of the title compounds. The exchange
interactions within the trimers are well described by the Heisenberg model with
dominant antiferromagnetic nearest-neighbor interactions J. For x=0 we find
JCu-Cu=-4.74(2) meV which is enhanced for x=1 to JCu-Cu=-4.92(6) meV. For x=1
and x=2 we find JCu-Ni=-0.85(10) meV and an axial single-ion anisotropy
parameter DNi=-0.7(1) meV. While the x=0 and x=1 compounds do not exhibit
long-range magnetic ordering down to 1 K, the x=2 compound shows
antiferromagnetic ordering below TN=20 K, which is compatible with the
molecular-field parameter 0.63(12) meV derived by neutron spectroscopy.
"
"What is the relationship between the amount of dark matter and the speed of the bullet subhalo and the ""bullet"" X-ray gas in the merging bullet galaxy cluster?","  We present semi-analytical constraint on the amount of dark matter in the
merging bullet galaxy cluster using the classical Local Group timing arguments.
We consider particle orbits in potential models which fit the lensing data.
{\it Marginally consistent} CDM models in Newtonian gravity are found with a
total mass M_{CDM} = 1 x 10^{15}Msun of Cold DM: the bullet subhalo can move
with V_{DM}=3000km/s, and the ""bullet"" X-ray gas can move with
V_{gas}=4200km/s. These are nearly the {\it maximum speeds} that are
accelerable by the gravity of two truncated CDM halos in a Hubble time even
without the ram pressure. Consistency breaks down if one adopts higher end of
the error bars for the bullet gas speed (5000-5400km/s), and the bullet gas
would not be bound by the sub-cluster halo for the Hubble time. Models with
V_{DM}~ 4500km/s ~ V_{gas} would invoke unrealistic large amount M_{CDM}=7x
10^{15}Msun of CDM for a cluster containing only ~ 10^{14}Msun of gas. Our
results are generalisable beyond General Relativity, e.g., a speed of
$4500\kms$ is easily obtained in the relativistic MONDian lensing model of
Angus et al. (2007). However, MONDian model with little hot dark matter
$M_{HDM} \le 0.6\times 10^{15}\msun$ and CDM model with a small halo mass $\le
1\times 10^{15}\msun$ are barely consistent with lensing and velocity data.
"
What are the minimal roots of finitely generated unit O_X[\sigma]--modules?,"  In this note we show that finitely generated unit $O_X[\sigma]$--modules for
$X$ regular and $F$--finite have a minimal root (in the sense of [Lyubeznik,
F-modules] Definition~3.6). This problem was posed by Lyubeznik and answered by
himself in the case that $X=\Spec R$ is a complete local ring.
  One immediate consequence of this result is that the parameter test module of
tight closure theory commutes with localization. As a further application of
the methods in this paper we give new proofs of the results on discreteness and
rationality of $F$--thresholds [arXiv:0705.1210] and on $D$-module generation
[arXiv:math/0502405v1]. The new proofs are valid in a slightly more general
setting such that they also party cover the generalizations recently obtained
in [arXiv:0706.3028].
"
network substrate?,"  In this work we solve exactly a class of three-body propagators for the most
general quadratic interactions in the coordinates, for arbitrary masses and
couplings. This is done both for the constant as the time-dependent couplings
and masses, by using the Feynman path integral formalism. Finally the energy
spectrum and the eigenfunctions are recovered from the propagators.
"
What are the Lie point symmetries of the Kohn-Laplace equations?,"  We show which Lie point symmetries of non-critical semilinear Kohn-Laplace
equations on the Heisenberg group $H^1$ are Noether symmetries and we establish
their respectives conservations laws.
"
What is the relationship between the performance of holonomic quantum gates and the effect of a dissipative environment?,"  We study the performance of holonomic quantum gates, driven by lasers, under
the effect of a dissipative environment modeled as a thermal bath of
oscillators. We show how to enhance the performance of the gates by suitable
choice of the loop in the manifold of the controllable parameters of the laser.
For a simplified, albeit realistic model, we find the surprising result that
for a long time evolution the performance of the gate (properly estimated in
terms of average fidelity) increases. On the basis of this result, we compare
holonomic gates with the so-called stimulated Raman adiabatic passage (STIRAP)
gates.
"
What is the nature of the X-ray pulsations observed in the neutron-star X-ray binary SAX J1748.9--2021?,"  We report on intermittent X-ray pulsations with a frequency of 442.36 Hz from
the neutron-star X-ray binary SAX J1748.9--2021 in the globular cluster NGC
6440. The pulsations were seen during both 2001 and 2005 outbursts of the
source, but only intermittently, appearing and disappearing on timescales of
hundreds of seconds. We find a suggestive relation between the occurrence of
type-I X-ray bursts and the appearance of the pulsations but the relation is
not strict. This behavior is very similar to that of the intermittent accreting
millisecond X-ray pulsar HETE J1900.1--2455. The reason for the intermittence
of the pulsations remains unclear. However it is now evident that a strict
division between pulsating and non-pulsating does not exist. By studying the
Doppler shift of the pulsation frequency we determine an orbit with a period of
8.7 hrs and an projected semi major axis of 0.39 lightsec. The companion star
might be a main--sequence or a slightly evolved star with a mass of $\sim$1
$M_\odot$. Therefore, SAX J1748.9--2021 has a longer period and may have a more
massive companion star than all the other accreting millisecond X-ray pulsars
except for Aql X-1.
"
What are the implications of relaxing the assumption of A0=0 in the minimal super-gravity (mSUGRA) model?,"  Phenomenologically viable and interesting regions of parameter space in the
minimal super-gravity (mSUGRA) model with small $m_0$ and small $m_{1/2}$
consistent with the WMAP data on dark matter relic density and the bound on the
mass of the lightest Higgs scalar $ m_h>$ 114 GeV from LEP2 open up if the
rather adhoc assumption $A_0$=0, where $A_0$ is the common trilinear soft
breaking parameter, employed in most of the existing analyses is relaxed. Since
this region corresponds to relatively light squarks and gluinos which are
likely to be probed extensively in the very early stages of the LHC
experiments, the consequences of moderate or large negative values of $A_0$ are
examined in detail. We find that in this region several processes including
lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP) pair annihilation, LSP - lighter tau
slepton (${\tilde \tau}_1$) coannihilation and LSP - lighter top squark
(${\tilde t}_1$) coannihilation contribute to the observed dark matter relic
density. %\sout{The possibility that a relic density producing ${\tilde t}_1$
can be %observed at the current experiments at the Tevatron is wide open.} The
possibility that a ${\tilde t}_1$ that can participate in coannihilation with
the lightest neutralino to satisfy the WMAP bound on relic density and at the
same time be observed at the current experiments at the Tevatron is wide open.
At the LHC a large number of squark - gluino events lead to a very distinctive
semi-inclusive signature $\tau^\pm$+X$_\tau$ (anything without a tau lepton)
with a characteristic size much larger than $e^\pm$+X$_e$ or $\mu^\pm$+X$_\mu$
events.
"
"What is the algorithm for computing approximate balanced truncations for discrete-time, stable, linear time-periodic systems?","  We introduce an algorithm based on a method of snapshots for computing
approximate balanced truncations for discrete-time, stable, linear
time-periodic systems. By construction, this algorithm is applicable to very
high-dimensional systems, even with very high-dimensional outputs (or,
alternatively, very high-dimensional inputs). An example is shown to validate
the method.
"
What are the implications of the limited number of datapoints in the transition on the size of the graph instances?,"  A phase transition, like the one already found on Boolean satisfiability
problem by Kirkpatrick and Selman, is found on max clique problem on ER graphs.
Although number of the datapoints is limited, the transition seems to obey
finite size scaling. The transition also shows concentration of the graph
instances which need particularly large CPU time to solve.
"
What are the main properties of the Total SVD algorithm?,"  Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is the basic body of many statistical
algorithms and few users question whether SVD is properly handling its job.
  SVD aims at evaluating the decomposition that best approximates a data
matrix, given some rank restriction. However often we are interested in the
best components of the decomposition rather than in the best approximation .
This conflict of objectives leads us to introduce {\em Total SVD}, where the
word ""Total"" is taken as in ""Total"" least squares.
  SVD is a least squares method and, therefore, is very sensitive to gross
errors in the data matrix. We make SVD robust by imposing a weight to each of
the matrix entries. Breakdown properties are excellent.
  Algorithmic aspects are handled; they rely on high dimension fixed point
computations.
"
What is the response surface method used to update the finite element model parameters?,"  This paper proposes the response surface method for finite element model
updating. The response surface method is implemented by approximating the
finite element model surface response equation by a multi-layer perceptron. The
updated parameters of the finite element model were calculated using genetic
algorithm by optimizing the surface response equation. The proposed method was
compared to the existing methods that use simulated annealing or genetic
algorithm together with a full finite element model for finite element model
updating. The proposed method was tested on an unsymmetri-cal H-shaped
structure. It was observed that the proposed method gave the updated natural
frequen-cies and mode shapes that were of the same order of accuracy as those
given by simulated annealing and genetic algorithm. Furthermore, it was
observed that the response surface method achieved these results at a
computational speed that was more than 2.5 times as fast as the genetic
algorithm and a full finite element model and 24 times faster than the
simulated annealing.
"
"What are the implications of active neutrinos with ""accidentally small"" masses on the Higgs boson decay mode?","  If the Standard Model particle content is extended by gauge singlet fermions
(right-handed neutrinos), active neutrinos generically acquire (Majorana)
masses, in agreement with our current understanding of the lepton sector. If
the right-handed neutrino masses are of the same order as the electroweak
symmetry breaking scale, it is usually expected that these will not mediate any
experimentally observable effects. Here, I explore the fact that this is not
necessarily the case. If neutrino masses are ""accidentally small"",
active-sterile mixing angles can, according to current experimental bounds, be
as large as several percent. If this is the case, I argue that the dominant
decay mode of light (M_H less than 130 GeV) Higgs bosons could be into an
active and a sterile neutrino. The sterile neutrino decays promptly into a
charge lepton and an on- or off-shell W-boson, so that the dominant Higgs boson
decay mode is H to leptons + jets + missing transverse energy.
"
What is the minimum output entropy of a bosonic channel with additive thermal noise?,"  Previous work on the classical information capacities of bosonic channels has
established the capacity of the single-user pure-loss channel, bounded the
capacity of the single-user thermal-noise channel, and bounded the capacity
region of the multiple-access channel. The latter is a multi-user scenario in
which several transmitters seek to simultaneously and independently communicate
to a single receiver. We study the capacity region of the bosonic broadcast
channel, in which a single transmitter seeks to simultaneously and
independently communicate to two different receivers. It is known that the
tightest available lower bound on the capacity of the single-user thermal-noise
channel is that channel's capacity if, as conjectured, the minimum von Neumann
entropy at the output of a bosonic channel with additive thermal noise occurs
for coherent-state inputs. Evidence in support of this minimum output entropy
conjecture has been accumulated, but a rigorous proof has not been obtained. In
this paper, we propose a new minimum output entropy conjecture that, if proved
to be correct, will establish that the capacity region of the bosonic broadcast
channel equals the inner bound achieved using a coherent-state encoding and
optimum detection. We provide some evidence that supports this new conjecture,
but again a full proof is not available.
"
What are the material parameters for a composite grid structure?,"  As an example of thin composite layers we consider single and double grids of
periodically arranged interacting wires loaded with a certain distributed
reactive impedance. Currents induced to the wires by a normally incident plane
wave are rigorously calculated and the corresponding dipole moment densities
are determined. Using this data and the averaged fields we assign mesoscopic
material parameters for the proposed grid structures. These parameters depend
on the number of grids, and measure the averaged induced polarizations. It is
demonstrated that properly loaded double grids possess polarization response
that over some frequency range can be described by assigning negative values
for the mesoscopic parameters. Discussion is conducted on the physical
meaningfulness to assign such material parameters for thin composite slabs. The
results predicted by the proposed method for the double-grid structures are
compared with the results obtained using the commonly adopted S-parameter
retrieval procedure.
"
What are the second moments and functional forms of the u- and s-quark fragmentation functions that can distinguish the tetraquark structure from $q\bar q$?,"  It is proposed that fragmentation functions should be used to identify exotic
hadrons. As an example, fragmentation functions of the scalar meson f_0(980)
are investigated. It is pointed out that the second moments and functional
forms of the u- and s-quark fragmentation functions can distinguish the
tetraquark structure from $q\bar q$. By the global analysis of f_0 (980)
production data in electron-positron annihilation, its fragmentation functions
and their uncertainties are determined. It is found that the current available
data are not sufficient to determine its internal structure, while precise data
in future should be able to identify exotic quark configurations.
"
What are the decoherence properties of adiabatic quantum computation in the presence of low-frequency noise?,"  We have studied the decoherence properties of adiabatic quantum computation
(AQC) in the presence of in general non-Markovian, e.g., low-frequency, noise.
The developed description of the incoherent Landau-Zener transitions shows that
the global AQC maintains its properties even for decoherence larger than the
minimum gap at the anticrossing of the two lowest energy levels. The more
efficient local AQC, however, does not improve scaling of the computation time
with the number of qubits $n$ as in the decoherence-free case. The scaling
improvement requires phase coherence throughout the computation, limiting the
computation time and the problem size n.
"
What is the impact of Virtual Manufacturing (VM) on the manufacturing phase?,"  The research area ""Virtual Manufacturing (VM)'' is the use of information
technology and computer simulation to model real world manufacturing processes
for the purpose of analysing and understanding them. As automation technologies
such as CAD/CAM have substantially shortened the time required to design
products, Virtual Manufacturing will have a similar effect on the manufacturing
phase thanks to the modelling, simulation and optimisation of the product and
the processes involved in its fabrication. After a description of Virtual
Manufacturing (definitions and scope), we present some socio-economic factors
of VM and finaly some ""hot topics'' for the future are proposed.
"
What is the subspace where the X-ray transform fails to be injective?,"  We consider Anosov thermostats on a closed surface and the X-ray transform on
functions which are up to degree two in the velocities. We show that the
subspace where the X-ray transform fails to be s-injective is finite
dimensional. Furthermore, if the surface is negatively curved and the
thermostat is pure Gaussian (i.e. no magnetic field is present), then the X-ray
transform is s-injective.
"
What is the anisotropic solution for a flat 5+1 dimensional Universe?,"  We write down an anisotropic solution for a flat 5+1 dimensional Universe in
Gauss-Bonnet gravity. In the model under investigation this solution replaces
the generalized Kasner solution near a cosmological singularity.
"
What is the solution to the analytic classification of plane branches in a finite field?,"  In this paper we give a solution to Zariski's problem of analytic
classification of plane branches.
"
What is the consistency of the data with the dynamical model?,"  The NA60 experiment has measured low-mass muon pair production in In-In
collisions at 158 A GeV with unprecedented precision. We show that this data is
reproduced very well by a dynamical model with parameters scaled from fits to
measurements of hadronic transverse mass spectra and Hanbury-Brown and Twiss
correlations in Pb-Pb and Pb-Au collisions at the same energy. The data is
consistent with in-medium properties of $\rho$ and $\omega$-mesons at finite
temperature and density as deduced from empirical forward-scattering
amplitudes. Inclusion of the vacuum decay of the $\rho$-meson after freeze-out
is necessary for an understanding of the mass and transverse momentum spectrum
of dimuons with $M \apprle 0.9 {\rm GeV}/c^2$.
"
What is the Tassie-Barker factor in the context of the Slater determinant wave function?,"  The approach exposed in the recent paper (A. Shebeko, P. Papakonstantinou, E.
Mavrommatis, Eur. Phys. J. A 27, 143 (2006)) has been applied in studying
center-of-mass motion effects on the nucleon density and momentum distributions
in nuclei. We are focused upon effects due to the center-of-mass and
short-range nucleon correlations embedded in translationally invariant
ground-state wavefunctions. The latter are constructed in the so-called fixed
center-of-mass approximation, starting with a Slater determinant wave function
modified by some correlator (e.g., after Jastrow or Villars). It is shown how
one can simplify evaluation of the corresponding expectation values that
determine the distributions. The analytic expressions derived here involve the
own ""Tassie-Barker"" factors for each distribution. As an illustration,
numerical calculations have been carried out for the nucleus ^{4}He with the
Slater determinant to describe the nucleon (1s)^4 configuration composed of
single-particle orbitals which differ from harmonic oscillator ones at small
distances. Such orbitals simulate somewhat short-range repulsion between
nucleons. Special attention is paid to a simultaneous shrinking of the
center--of--mass corrected density and momentum distributions compared to the
purely (1s)^4 shell nontranslationally invariant ones.
"
What are the conditions for a 3D two-flavor Gross-Neveu model to have a ground state with pure diquark condensates?,"  The effective potential analysis indicates that, in a 3D two-flavor
Gross-Neveu model in vacuum, depending on less or bigger than the critical
value 2/3 of $G_S/H_P$, where $G_S$ and $H_P$ are respectively the coupling
constants of scalar quark-antiquark channel and pseudoscalar diquark channel,
the system will have the ground state with pure diquark condensates or with
pure quark-antiquark condensates, but no the one with coexistence of the two
forms of condensates. The similarities and differences in the interplay between
the quark-antiquark and the diquark condensates in vacuum in the 2D, 3D and 4D
two-flavor four-fermion interaction models are summarized.
"
What is the Jarlskog determinant related to neutrino and Higgs fields?,"  We study the Planck scale effects on Jarlskog determinant. Quantum
gravitational (Planck scale) effects lead to an effective SU(2)_{L}\times U(1)
invariant dimension-5 Lagrangian involving neutrino and Higgs fields, which
gives rise to additional terms in neutrino mass matrix on electroweak symmetry
breaking. We assume that gravitational interaction is flavor blind and compute
the Jarlskog determinant due to the Planck scale effects. In the case of
neutrino sector, the strength of CP violation is measured by Jarlskog
determinant. In this paper, we assume CP violation arise from Planck scale
effects. We applied our approach to study Jarlskog determinant due to the
Planck scale effects.
"
Who is the author of the problems in geometric group theory?,"  This is a survey of some problems in geometric group theory which I find
interesting. The problems are from different areas of group theory. Each
section is devoted to problems in one area. It contains an introduction where I
give some necessary definitions and motivations, problems and some discussions
of them. For each problem, I try to mention the author. If the author is not
given, the problem, to the best of my knowledge, was formulated by me first.
"
What are the ultra-high energy neutrino cross sections estimated based on an extrapolation?,"  Estimates are made of the ultra-high energy neutrino cross sections based on
an extrapolation to very small Bjorken x of the logarithmic Froissart
dependence in x shown previously to provide an excellent fit to the measured
proton structure function F_2^p(x,Q^2) over a broad range of the virtuality
Q^2. Expressions are obtained for both the neutral current and the charged
current cross sections. Comparison with an extrapolation based on perturbative
QCD shows good agreement for energies where both fit data, but our rates are as
much as a factor of 10 smaller for neutrino energies above 10^9 GeV, with
important implications for experiments searching for extra-galactic neutrinos.
"
What are the classical and quantum mechanical descriptions of lattice dynamics?,"  We present classical and quantum mechanical descriptions of lattice dynamics,
from the atomic to the continuum scale, using atomic scale symmetry modes and
their constraint equations. This approach is demonstrated for a one-dimensional
chain and a two-dimensional square lattice with a monatomic basis. For the
classical description, we find that rigid modes, in addition to the
distortional modes found before, are necessary to describe the kinetic energy.
The long wavelength limit of the kinetic energy terms expressed in terms of
atomic scale modes is shown to be consistent with the continuum theory, and the
leading order corrections are obtained. For the quantum mechanical description,
we find conjugate momenta for the atomic scale symmetry modes. In direct space,
graphical rules for their commutation relations are obtained. Commutation
relations in the reciprocal space are also calculated. As an example, phonon
modes are analyzed in terms of symmetry modes. We emphasize that the approach
based on atomic scale symmetry modes could be useful, for example, for the
description of multiscale lattice dynamics and the dynamics near structural
phase transition.
"
What is the relationship between the existence of asymptotic firing throughputs and the vector of the throughputs for all transitions in a live and bounded Free Choice Petri net?,"  In a live and bounded Free Choice Petri net, pick a non-conflicting
transition. Then there exists a unique reachable marking in which no transition
is enabled except the selected one. For a routed live and bounded Free Choice
net, this property is true for any transition of the net. Consider now a live
and bounded stochastic routed Free Choice net, and assume that the routings and
the firing times are independent and identically distributed. Using the above
results, we prove the existence of asymptotic firing throughputs for all
transitions in the net. Furthermore the vector of the throughputs at the
different transitions is explicitly computable up to a multiplicative constant.
"
What is the relationship between the Planck length and the maximum momentum in the accelerating universe expansion?,"  We develop here a mechanism that, without making use of a cosmological
constant, reproduces an accelerating universe. This is done by taking into
account Casimir vacuum energy density, assuming that the underlying theory
allows a maximum momentum, that turns out to be the leading contribution term
to Einstein equations in a large expanding FRW universe. As stated in numerous
quantum gravity studies, we postulate that maximum momentum is related to the
existence of the Planck length as a fundamental length. This insight, together
with the assumption of a Planck scale correction to the energy/momentum
dispersion-relation on a FRW background, is used here to calculate Casimir
vacuum energy. We show that, under these hypothesis, an accelerated universe
expansion is obtained. As last step we analyze the compatibility of the
resulting model with experimental data, writing down the equation of state for
Casimir energy and pressure and observing that this equation of state belongs
to a class of models that naturally fits cosmological observations. We
emphasize that our result relies, once a fundamental length is introduced in
Casimir effect, just on general arguments thus it is independent on an explicit
form of the energy-momentum dispersion relation.
"
What are the implications of thermalized non-equilibrated matter in many-body systems?,"  A characteristic feature of thermalized non-equilibrated matter is that, in
spite of energy relaxation--equilibration, a phase memory of the way the
many-body system was excited remains. As an example, we analyze data on a
strong forward peaking of thermal proton yield in the Bi($\gamma$,p)
photonuclear reaction. New analysis shows that the phase relaxation in
highly-excited heavy nuclei can be 8 orders of magnitude or even much longer
than the energy relaxation. We argue that thermalized non-equilibrated matter
resembles a high temperature superconducting state in quantum many-body
systems. We briefly present results on the time-dependent correlation function
of the many-particle density fluctuations for such a superconducting state. It
should be of interest to experimentally search for manifestations of
thermalized non-equilibrated matter in many-body mesoscopic systems and
nanostructures.
"
What are the symmetries and holomorphic properties of these systems?,"  We find a five-parameter family of partial differential systems in two
variables with two polynomial Hamiltonians. We give its symmetry and holomorphy
conditions. These symmetries, holomorphy conditions and invariant divisors are
new.
"
What is the solution of a Cauchy problem related to a linear second-order difference equation with constant noncommutative coefficients?,"  The exact solution of a Cauchy problem related to a linear second-order
difference equation with constant noncommutative coefficients is reported.
"
What are the main results of quantum transport calculations on carbon nanotube field effect transistors?,"  The observed performances of carbon nanotube field effect transistors are
examined using first-principles quantum transport calculations. We focus on the
nature and role of the electrical contact of Au and Pd electrodes to open-ended
semiconducting nanotubes, allowing the chemical contact at the surface to fully
develop through large-scale relaxation of the contacting atomic configuration.
We present the first direct numerical evidence of Pd contacts exhibiting
perfect transparency for hole injection as opposed to that of Au contacts.
Their respective Schottky barrier heights, on the other hand, turn out to be
fairly similar for realistic contact models. These findings are in general
agreement with experimental data reported to date, and show that a Schottky
contact is not merely a passive ohmic contact but actively influences the
device I-V behavior.
"
What is the universal monoidal category with an object X with a semigroup and a cosemigroup structures?,"  We prove that the monoidal 2-category of cospans of finite linear orders and
surjections is the universal monoidal category with an object X with a
semigroup and a cosemigroup structures, where the two structures satisfy a
certain 2-dimensional separable algebra condition.
"
What are the results of the generating function of k-noncrossing RNA pseudoknot structures?,"  A k-noncrossing RNA pseudoknot structure is a graph over $\{1,...,n\}$
without 1-arcs, i.e. arcs of the form (i,i+1) and in which there exists no
k-set of mutually intersecting arcs. In particular, RNA secondary structures
are 2-noncrossing RNA structures. In this paper we prove a central and a local
limit theorem for the distribution of the numbers of 3-noncrossing RNA
structures over n nucleotides with exactly h bonds. We will build on the
results of \cite{Reidys:07rna1} and \cite{Reidys:07rna2}, where the generating
function of k-noncrossing RNA pseudoknot structures and the asymptotics for its
coefficients have been derived. The results of this paper explain the findings
on the numbers of arcs of RNA secondary structures obtained by molecular
folding algorithms and predict the distributions for k-noncrossing RNA folding
algorithms which are currently being developed.
"
What are the generalisations of the pseudo-Friedrichs extension?,"  We give general spectral and eigenvalue perturbation bounds for a selfadjoint
operator perturbed in the sense of the pseudo-Friedrichs extension. We also
give several generalisations of the aforementioned extension. The spectral
bounds for finite eigenvalues are obtained by using analyticity and
monotonicity properties (rather than variational principles) and they are
general enough to include eigenvalues in gaps of the essential spectrum.
"
What is the relationship between the action of rigid strings and the geometric properties of center vortices in SU(2) lattice gauge theory?,"  It is shown that the action associated with center vortices in SU(2) lattice
gauge theory is strongly correlated with extrinsic and internal curvatures of
the vortex surface and that this correlation persists in the continuum limit.
Thus a good approximation for the effective vortex action is the action of
rigid strings, which can reproduce some of the observed geometric properties of
center vortices. It is conjectured that rigidity may be induced by some fields
localized on vortices, and a model-independent test of localization is
performed. Monopoles detected in the Abelian projection are discussed as
natural candidates for such two-dimensional fields.
"
How is the behavior of the curvature field in the two-dimensional fluid flow described?,"  The curvature field is measured from tracer particle trajectories in a
two-dimensional fluid flow that exhibits spatiotemporal chaos, and is used to
extract the hyperbolic and elliptic points of the flow. These special points
are pinned to the forcing when the driving is weak, but wander over the domain
and interact in pairs at stronger driving, changing the local topology of the
flow. Their behavior reveals a two-stage transition to spatiotemporal chaos: a
gradual loss of spatial and temporal order followed by an abrupt onset of
topological changes.
"
What are the spectral characteristics of the dwarf irregular galaxy DDO 53?,"  The spectral characteristics throughout the dwarf irregular galaxy DDO 53 are
studied. The results are very similar to those for other irregular galaxies:
high excitation and low values of the [SII]/Halpha ratio. The most likely
ionization source is photon leakage from the classical HII regions, without any
other source, although the interstellar medium of the galaxy is quite
perturbed. Moreover, the physical conditions throughout the galaxy do not
change very much because both the photon leakage percentage and the ionization
temperature are very similar. In addition, the determined metal content for two
HII regions indicates that DDO 53 is a low-metallicity galaxy.
"
What are the two computational regimes in which Hodgkin-Huxley neurons operate?,"  Recent in vitro data show that neurons respond to input variance with varying
sensitivities. Here, we demonstrate that Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) neurons can
operate in two computational regimes, one that is more sensitive to input
variance (differentiating) and one that is less sensitive (integrating). A
boundary plane in the 3D conductance space separates these two regimes. For a
reduced HH model, this plane can be derived analytically from the V nullcline,
thus suggesting a means of relating biophysical parameters to neural
computation by analyzing the neuron's dynamical system.
"
What are the Liouville's transport equation solutions for vector fields?,"  The theory of the last multipliers as solutions of the Liouville's transport
equation, previously developed for vector fields, is extended here to general
multivectors. Characterizations in terms of Witten and Marsden differentials
are reobtained as well as the algebraic structure of the set of multivectors
with a common last multiplier, namely Gerstenhaber algebra. Applications to
Poisson bivectors are presented by obtaining that last multipliers count for
''how far away'' is a Poisson structure from being exact with respect to a
given volume form. The notion of exact Poisson cohomology for an unimodular
Poisson structure on $IR^{n}$ is introduced.
"
What is the condition for the existence of a maximal interval of existence in the equation?,"  The \textit{parabolic scalar curvature equation} is a reaction-diffusion type
equation on an $(n-1)$-manifold $\Sigma$, the time variable of which shall be
denoted by $r$. Given a function $R$ on $[r_0,r_1)\times\Sigma$ and a family of
metrics $\gamma(r)$ on $\Sigma$, when the coefficients of this equation are
appropriately defined in terms of $\gamma$ and $R$, positive solutions give
metrics of prescribed scalar curvature $R$ on $[r_0,r_1)\times\Sigma$ in the
form \[ g=u^2dr^2+r^2\gamma.\] If the area element of $r^2\gamma$ is expanding
for increasing $r$, then the equation is parabolic, and the basic existence
problem is to take positive initial data at some $r=r_0$ and solve for $u$ on
the maximal interval of existence, which above was implicitly assumed to be
$I=[r_0,r_1)$; one often hopes that $r_1=\infty$. However, the case of greatest
physical interest, $R>0$, often leads to blow-up in finite time so that
$r_1<\infty$. It is the purpose of the present work to investigate the
situation in which the blow-up nonetheless occurs in such a way that $g$ is
continuously extendible to $\bar M=[r_0,r_1]\times\Sigma$ as a manifold with
totally geodesic outer boundary at $r=r_1$.
"
What is the quantumness test proposed in this paper?,"  We propose a simple test of quantumness which can decide whether for the
given set of accessible experimental data the classical model is insufficient.
Take two observables $ A,B$ such that for any state $\psi$ their mean values
satisfy $0\leq <\psi|A|\psi>\leq <\psi|B|\psi>\leq 1$. If there exists a state
$\phi$ such that the second moments fulfill the inequality $<\phi|A^2|\phi>
><\phi|B^2|\phi>$ then the system cannot be described by the classical
probabilistic scheme. An example of an optimal triple $(A,B,\phi)$ in the case
of a qubit is given.
"
How are the fractional derivative and Monte Carlo approaches used to model anomalous diffusion in particle transport?,"  This paper deals with a comparison of Fractional Derivative and Monte carlo
approaches to the modelling of anomalous diffusion in the field of particle
transport. The goal of this research is to provide a better insight on the
behavior of (radioactive) contaminant tracers when flowing through
heterogeneous media.
"
What are the new inference techniques that correct the biases of the PRF method?,"  The distribution of genetic polymorphisms in a population contains
information about the mutation rate and the strength of natural selection at a
locus. Here, we show that the Poisson Random Field (PRF) method of
population-genetic inference suffers from systematic biases that tend to
underestimate selection pressures and mutation rates, and that erroneously
infer positive selection. These problems arise from the infinite-sites
approximation inherent in the PRF method. We introduce three new inference
techniques that correct these problems. We present a finite-site modification
of the PRF method, as well as two new methods for inferring selection pressures
and mutation rates based on diffusion models. Our methods can be used to infer
not only a ""weighted average"" of selection pressures acting on a gene sequence,
but also the distribution of selection pressures across sites. We evaluate the
accuracy of our methods, as well that of the original PRF approach, by
comparison with Wright-Fisher simulations.
"
How do the predicted large-angle EE and TE power spectra compare with WMAP observations?,"  We derive the CMB radiative transfer equation in the form of a multipole
hierarchy in the nearly-Friedmann-Robertson-Walker limit of homogeneous, but
anisotropic, universes classified via their Bianchi type. Compared with
previous calculations, this allows a more sophisticated treatment of
recombination, produces predictions for the polarization of the radiation, and
allows for reionization. Our derivation is independent of any assumptions about
the dynamical behaviour of the field equations, except that it requires
anisotropies to be small back to recombination; this is already demanded by
observations.
  We calculate the polarization signal in the Bianchi VIIh case, with the
parameters recently advocated to mimic the several large-angle anomalous
features observed in the CMB. We find that the peak polarization signal is ~
1.2 micro K for the best-fit model to the temperature anisotropies, and is
mostly confined to multipoles l<10. Remarkably, the predicted large-angle EE
and TE power spectra in the Bianchi model are consistent with WMAP observations
that are usually interpreted as evidence of early reionization. However, the
power in B-mode polarisation is predicted to be similar to the E-mode power and
parity-violating correlations are also predicted by the model; the WMAP
non-detection of either of these signals casts further strong doubts on the
veracity of attempts to explain the large-angle anomalies with global
anisotropy. On the other hand, given that there exist further dynamical degrees
of freedom in the VIIh universes that are yet to be compared with CMB
observations, we cannot at this time definitively reject the anisotropy
explanation.
"
How does the chaotic inflation model in supergravity provide a new perspective on the inflation model in supergravity?,"  Even though the chaotic inflation is one of the most popular inflation models
for its simple dynamics and compelling resolutions to the initial condition
problems, its realization in supergravity has been considered a challenging
task. We discuss how the chaotic inflation dominated by the D-term can be
induced in supergravity, which would give a new perspective on the inflation
model building in supergravity.
"
What are the new contributions of the predicted extra Higgs and extra neutral gauge boson to leptogenesis?,"  We address the issue of the neutrino masses and mixing in TeV scale $B-L$
extension of the Standard Model. We show that if Dirac neutrino masses are of
order $10^{-4}$ Gev, then the measured neutrino masses are correctly obtained.
We propose a mass relation between quarks and leptons that may account for such
small Dirac neutrino masses. We analyze the leptogenesis in this type of models
and provide analytical expressions for the new contributions due to the
predicted extra Higgs and extra neutral gauge boson. We find that thermal
leptogenesis, with a resonant enhancement due to nearly degenerate right-handed
neutrinos, can yield sufficient baryon asymmetry. Finally, we comment on a
possible scheme for non-thermal leptogenesis, which is due to the decay of
extra Higgs into right-handed neutrino.
"
What is the pattern of falling granular fingers separated by rising bubbles of air?,"  A granular instability driven by gravity is studied experimentally and
numerically. The instability arises as grains fall in a closed Hele-Shaw cell
where a layer of dense granular material is positioned above a layer of air.
The initially flat front defined by the grains subsequently develops into a
pattern of falling granular fingers separated by rising bubbles of air. A
transient coarsening of the front is observed right from the start by a finger
merging process. The coarsening is later stabilized by new fingers growing from
the center of the rising bubbles. The structures are quantified by means of
Fourier analysis and quantitative agreement between experiment and computation
is shown. This analysis also reveals scale invariance of the flow structures
under overall change of spatial scale.
"
What is the Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov method used to study a rotating bosonic many-body system?,"  A rotating bosonic many-body system in a harmonic trap is studied with the
3D-Cranked Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov method at zero temperature, which has been
applied to nuclear many-body systems at high spin. This method is a variational
method extended from the Hartree-Fock theory, which can treat the pairing
correlations in a self-consistent manner. An advantage of this method is that a
finite-range interaction between constituent particles can be used in the
calculation, unlike the original Gross-Pitaevskii approach. To demonstrate the
validity of our method, we present a calculation for a toy model, that is, a
rotating system of ten bosonic particles interacting through the repulsive
quadrupole-quadrupole interaction in a harmonic trap. It is found that the
yrast states, the lowest-energy states for the given total angular momentum,
does not correspond to the Bose-Einstein condensate, except a few special
cases. One of such cases is a vortex state, which appears when the total
angular momentum $L$ is twice the particle number $N$ (i.e., $L=2N$).
"
What is the absorption ratio of the nuclear reaction for different isotope masses?,"  We reveal the hydrogen isotope effect of three chemical reactions, i.e, the
reflection, the absorption and the penetration ratios, by classical molecular
dynamics simulation with a modified Brenner's reactive empirical bond order
(REBO) potential potential. We find that the reflection by pi-electron does not
depend on the mass of the incident isotope, but the peak of the reflection by
nuclear moves to higher side of incident energy. In addition to the reflection,
we also find that the absorption ratio in the positive z side of the graphene
becomes larger, as the mass of the incident isotope becomes larger. On the
other hand, the absorption ratio in the negative z side of the graphene becomes
smaller. Last, it is found that the penetration ratio does not depend on the
mass of the incident isotope because the graphene potential is not affected by
the mass.
"
What are the essential components of a room-temperature superconductor?,"  To synthesize a new superconductor which has a critical temperature, Tc,
exceeding the room temperature, one needs to know what chemical components to
start with. This chapter presents analysis of experimental data which allow one
to draw a conclusion about components and the structure of a potential
room-temperature superconductor. The two essential components of a room
temperature superconductor are large organic molecules (polymers, tissues) and
atoms/molecules which are magnetic in the intercalated state. This conclusion
is fully based on experimental facts known today, and does not require any
assumptions about the mechanism of room-temperature superconductivity. This,
however, does not mean that to synthesize a room-temperature superconductor is
an easy task.
"
What is the X-ray morphology of a 300 kpc long X-ray jet in PKS 1127-145?,"  The complex X-ray morphology of the 300 kpc long X-ray jet in PKS1127-145
(z=1.18 quasar) is clearly discerned in a ~100 ksec Chandra observation. The
jet X-ray surface brightness gradually decreases by an order of magnitude going
out from the core. The X-ray spectrum of the inner jet is relatively flat with
alpha_X=0.66+/-0.15 and steep in the outer jet with alpha_X=1.0+/-0.2. The
X-ray and radio jet intensity profiles are strikingly different, with the radio
emission peaking strongly at the two outer knots while the X-ray emission is
strongest in the inner jet region. We discuss the constraints implied by these
data on the X-ray emission models and conclude that ``one-zone'' models fail
and that at least a two-component model is needed to explain the jet's
broadband emission. We propose that the X-ray emission originates in the jet
proper while the bulk of the radio emission comes from a surrounding jet
sheath. We also consider intermittent jet activity as a possible cause of the
observed jet morphology.
"
What is the relation of the research in the article to other prior publications?,"  This comment clarifies the relation of the research in a recently published
article [Phys. Plasmas 14, 042503 (2007)] to other prior publications
addressing the inclusion of electromagnetic and drift-kinetic electron physics
in gyrokinetic simulation, raises a concern related to the inclusion of kinetic
electrons in a system with magnetic shear, and discusses alternatives in the
face of an important limitation on the general applicability of the algorithm
described therein.
"
"What is the dissipation of magnetic fields in Hall plasma of neutron stars, magnetars?","  Dissipation of magnetic fields in Hall plasma of neutron star crusts may
power persistent high energy emission of a class of strongly magnetized
neutrons stars, magnetars. We consider development of a dissipative tearing
mode in Hall plasma (electron MHD) and find that its growth rate increases with
the wave number of perturbations, reaching a maximum value intermediate between
resistive $\tau_r$ and Hall times $\tau_H$, $\Gamma\sim 1 / \sqrt{\tau_r
\tau_H}$.
  We argue that the tearing mode may be the principal mechanism by which strong
magnetic fields are dissipated in magnetars on times scale of $\sim 10^4-10^5$
yrs powering the persistent X-ray emisison.
"
What is the relationship between the computation of the propagator in general relativistic quantum mechanics and the computation of the propagator for stationary systems in non-relativistic quantum mechanics?,"  The phenomenology of quantum systems in curved space-times is among the most
fascinating fields of physics, allowing --often at the gedankenexperiment
level-- constraints on tentative theories of quantum gravity. Determining the
dynamics of fields in curved backgrounds remains however a complicated task
because of the highly intricate partial differential equations involved,
especially when the space metric exhibits no symmetry. In this article, we
provide --in a pedagogical way-- a general formalism to determine this dynamics
at the semiclassical order. To this purpose, a generic expression for the
semiclassical propagator is computed and the equation of motion for the
probability four-current is derived. Those results underline a direct analogy
between the computation of the propagator in general relativistic quantum
mechanics and the computation of the propagator for stationary systems in
non-relativistic quantum mechanics. A possible application of this formalism to
curvature-induced quantum interferences is also discussed.
"
What is the relationship between the mixing angle θ and the decay rates for the $f_0(980)K^{*-}$ and $f_0(980)\ov K^{*0}$ modes?,"  The hadronic charmless B decays into a scalar meson and a vector meson are
studied within the framework of QCD factorization. The main results are: (i)
The decay rates for the $f_0(980)K^{*-}$ and $f_0(980)\ov K^{*0}$ modes depend
on the $f_0-\sigma$ mixing angle $\theta$. The experimental measurements can be
accommodated for $\theta\approx 20^\circ$. (ii) If the $a_0(980)$ is a $q\bar
q$ bound state, the predicted branching ratios for the channels $a_0^+\rho^-$
and $a_0^0\rho^-$ will be very large, of order $30\times 10^{-6}$ and $23\times
10^{-6}$, respectively. If the observation of or the experimental limit on
theses two modes is much smaller than the expectation of $\sim 25\times
10^{-6}$, this could hint at a four-quark nature for the $a_0(980)$. (iii) For
the $a_0(1450)$ channels, $a_0^+(1450)\rho^-$ and $a_0^0(1450)\rho^-$ are found
to have branching ratios of order $16\times 10^{-6}$ and $22\times 10^{-6}$,
respectively. A measurement of them at the predicted level will favor the
$q\bar q$ structure for the $a_0(1450)$. (iv) Contrary to the naive expectation
that $\Gamma(B^-\to a_0^0\rho^-)\sim {1\over 2}\Gamma(\bar B^0\to
a_0^+\rho^-)$, we found that they have comparable rates due to additional
contributions to the $a_0\rho^-$ mode from the $a_0^0$ emission. (v) The
predicted central value of $Br(\bar B^0\to\ov K^{*0}_0(1430)\phi)$ is larger
than experiment, though it can be accommodated within theoretical errors. The
decays $B\to K^{*}_0(1430)\rho$ are expected to have rates substantially larger
than that of $B\to K^{*}_0(1430)\pi$ owing to the constructive (destructive)
interference between the $a_4$ and $a_6$ penguin terms in the former (latter).
Experimentally, it is thus important to check if the $B\to K^{*}_0\rho$ modes
are enhanced relative to the corresponding $K_0^*\pi$ channels.
"
What are the roles of the transition-metal element in electronic structure and transport properties of quasicrystals and related complex phases?,"  In this paper, we briefly present our work on the role of transition-metal
element in electronic structure and transport properties of quasicrystals and
related complex phases. Several Parts of these works have been done or
initiated in collaboration with Prof. T. Fujiwara.
"
What are the implications of the observed flattening in the number counts of pBzK galaxies?,"  We investigate colour selection techniques for high redshift galaxies in the
UKIDSS Ultra Deep Survey Early Data Release (UDS EDR). Combined with very deep
Subaru optical photometry, the depth (K_AB = 22.5) and area (0.62 deg^2) of the
UDS EDR allows us to investigate optical/near-IR selection using a large sample
of over 30,000 objects. By using the B-z, z-K colour-colour diagram (the BzK
technique) we identify over 7500 candidate galaxies at z > 1.4, which can be
further separated into passive and starforming systems (pBzK and sBzK
respectively). Our unique sample allows us to identify a new feature not
previously seen in BzK diagrams, consistent with the passively evolving track
of early type galaxies at z < 1.4. We also compare the BzK technique with the
R-K colour selection of Extremely Red Objects (EROs) and the J-K selection of
Distant Red Galaxies (DRGs), and quantify the overlap between these
populations. We find that the majority of DRGs, at these relatively bright
magnitudes are also EROs. Since previous studies have found that DRGs at these
magnitudes have redshifts of z ~ 1 we determine that these DRG/ERO galaxies
have SEDs consistent with being dusty star-forming galaxies or AGN at z < 2.
Finally we observe a flattening in the number counts of pBzK galaxies, similar
to other studies, which may indicate that we are sampling the luminosity
function of passive z > 1 galaxies over a narrow redshift range.
"
What are the annihilation-creation operators for various quanta in the interacting multi-particle systems?,"  Exact Heisenberg operator solutions for independent `sinusoidal coordinates'
as many as the degree of freedom are derived for typical exactly solvable
multi-particle quantum mechanical systems, the Calogero systems based on any
root system. These Heisenberg operator solutions also present the explicit
forms of the annihilation-creation operators for various quanta in the
interacting multi-particle systems. At the same time they can be interpreted as
multi-variable generalisation of the three term recursion relations for
multi-variable orthogonal polynomials constituting the eigenfunctions.
"
What is the relationship between coronal and interior fields in astrophysical rotators?,"  Most large scale dynamo research for astrophysical rotators focuses on
interior flow driven helical dynamos (FDHDs), but larger scale coronal fields
most directly influence observations. It is thus important to understand the
relationship between coronal and interior fields. Coronal field relaxation is
actually a type of magnetically dominated helical dynamo (MDHD). MDHDs also
occur in fusion plasma devices where they drive a system toward its relaxed
state in response to magnetic helicity injection that otherwise drives the
system away from this state. Global scale fields of astrophysical rotators and
jets are thus plausibly produced by a direct coupling between an interior FDHD
and a coronal MDHD, interfaced by magnetic helicity transport through their
mutual boundary. Tracking the magnetic helicity also elucidates how both FDHD
and MDHDs evolve and saturate. The utility of magnetic helicity is unhampered
by its non-gauge invariance since physical fields can always be recovered.
"
What are the different classes of separable states in a composite fermionic system?,"  The anticommuting properties of fermionic operators, together with the
presence of parity conservation, affect the concept of entanglement in a
composite fermionic system. Hence different points of view can give rise to
different reasonable definitions of separable and entangled states. Here we
analyze these possibilities and the relationship between the different classes
of separable states. We illustrate the differences by providing a complete
characterization of all the sets defined for systems of two fermionic modes.
The results are applied to Gibbs states of infinite chains of fermions whose
interaction corresponds to a XY-Hamiltonian with transverse magnetic field.
"
What is the wall-crossing morphism for the KR homology of knots?,"  We define a wall-crossing morphism for Khovanov-Rozansky homology; that is, a
map between the KR homology of knots related by a crossing change. Using this
map, we extend KR homology to an invariant of singular knots categorifying the
Vasilliev derivative of the HOMFLY polynomial, and of $\mathfrak{sl}_n$ quantum
invariants.
"
What is the relationship between the solution to the 3D Navier-Stokes equation and the direction of the velocity in a flow?,"  In this short note, we give a link between the regularity of the solution $u$
to the 3D Navier-Stokes equation, and the behavior of the direction of the
velocity $u/|u|$. It is shown that the control of $\Div (u/|u|)$ in a suitable
$L_t^p(L_x^q)$ norm is enough to ensure global regularity. The result is
reminiscent of the criterion in terms of the direction of the vorticity,
introduced first by Constantin and Fefferman. But in this case the condition is
not on the vorticity, but on the velocity itself. The proof, based on very
standard methods, relies on a straightforward relation between the divergence
of the direction of the velocity and the growth of energy along streamlines.
"
What are the two azimuthal variations in the number of super-thermal electrons in the torus?,"  In this fourth paper in a series, we present a model of the remarkable
temporal and azimuthal variability of the Io plasma torus observed during the
Cassini encounter with Jupiter. Over a period of three months, the Cassini
Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrograph (UVIS) observed a dramatic variation in the
average torus composition. Superimposed on this long-term variation, is a
10.07-hour periodicity caused by an azimuthal variation in plasma composition
subcorotating relative to System III longitude. Quite surprisingly, the
amplitude of the azimuthal variation appears to be modulated at the beat
frequency between the System III period and the observed 10.07-hour period.
Previously, we have successfully modeled the months-long compositional change
by supposing a factor of three increase in the amount of material supplied to
Io's extended neutral clouds. Here, we extend our torus chemistry model to
include an azimuthal dimension. We postulate the existence of two azimuthal
variations in the number of super-thermal electrons in the torus: a primary
variation that subcorotates with a period of 10.07 hours and a secondary
variation that remains fixed in System III longitude. Using these two hot
electron variations, our model can reproduce the observed temporal and
azimuthal variations observed by Cassini UVIS.
"
What is the relationship between the runaway behavior of quiver gauge theory and the duality cascade in the moduli space of the moduli space?,"  We study the quantum corrections to the moduli space of the quiver gauge
theory corresponding to regular and fractional D3-branes at the dP_1
singularity. We find that besides the known runaway behavior at the lowest step
of the duality cascade, there is a runaway direction along a mesonic branch at
every higher step of the cascade. Moreover, the algebra of the chiral operators
which obtain the large expectation values is such that we reproduce Altmann's
first order deformation of the dP_1 cone.
"
What are the implications of the dwarf spheroidal galaxies for understanding dark matter and baryonic processes in the Local Group?,"  The nature of dark matter is one of the outstanding questions of
astrophysics. The internal motions of member stars reveal that the lowest
luminosity galaxies in the Local Group are the most dark-matter dominated. New
large datasets allow one to go further, and determine systematic properties of
their dark matter haloes. We summarise recent results, emphasising the critical
role of the dwarf spheroidal galaxies in understanding both dark matter and
baryonic processes that shape galaxy evolution.
"
What is the Bogoliubov-type operator used to derive the evolution of a hadronic light cone wave function?,"  We derive the evolution of a hadronic light cone wave function with energy at
weak coupling. Our derivation is valid both in the high and the low partonic
density limit, and thus encompasses both the JIMWLK and the KLWMIJ evolution.
The hadronic wave function is shown to evolve by the action of the
Bogoliubov-type operator, which diagonalizes on the soft gluon sector the
light-cone hamiltonian in the presence of an arbitrary valence charge density.
We find explicitly the action of this operator on the soft as well as the
valence degrees of freedom of the theory.
"
What is the contractivity of the underlying conditional expectation on $H^p(\A)$ for $p<1$?,"  Let $\A$ be a finite subdiagonal algebra in Arveson's sense. Let $H^p(\A)$ be
the associated noncommutative Hardy spaces, $0<p\le\8$. We extend to the case
of all positive indices most recent results about these spaces, which include
notably the Riesz, Szeg\""o and inner-outer type factorizations. One new tool of
the paper is the contractivity of the underlying conditional expectation on
$H^p(\A)$ for $p<1$.
"
What is the inverse-Ackermann function?,"  A generalized Davenport-Schinzel sequence is one over a finite alphabet that
contains no subsequences isomorphic to a fixed forbidden subsequence. One of
the fundamental problems in this area is bounding (asymptotically) the maximum
length of such sequences. Following Klazar, let Ex(\sigma,n) be the maximum
length of a sequence over an alphabet of size n avoiding subsequences
isomorphic to \sigma. It has been proved that for every \sigma, Ex(\sigma,n) is
either linear or very close to linear; in particular it is O(n
2^{\alpha(n)^{O(1)}}), where \alpha is the inverse-Ackermann function and O(1)
depends on \sigma. However, very little is known about the properties of \sigma
that induce superlinearity of \Ex(\sigma,n).
  In this paper we exhibit an infinite family of independent superlinear
forbidden subsequences. To be specific, we show that there are 17 prototypical
superlinear forbidden subsequences, some of which can be made arbitrarily long
through a simple padding operation. Perhaps the most novel part of our
constructions is a new succinct code for representing superlinear forbidden
subsequences.
"
How does the Monte Carlo-based stochastic simulation model characterize the distinct signaling behaviors in the two major pathways of apoptotic signaling?,"  Apoptosis, or genetically programmed cell death, is a crucial cellular
process that maintains the balance between life and death in cells. The precise
molecular mechanism of apoptosis signaling and how these two pathways are
differentially activated under distinct apoptotic stimuli is poorly understood.
We developed a Monte Carlo-based stochastic simulation model that can
characterize distinct signaling behaviors in the two major pathways of
apoptotic signaling using a novel probability distribution-based approach.
Specifically, we show that for a weak death signal, such as low levels of death
ligand Fas (CD95) binding or under stress conditions, the type 2 mitochondrial
pathway dominates apoptotic signaling. Our results also show signaling in the
type 2 pathway is stochastic, where the population average over many cells does
not capture the cell-to-cell fluctuations in the time course (~1 - 10 hours) of
downstream caspase-3 activation. On the contrary, the probability distribution
of caspase-3 activation for the mitochondrial pathway shows a distinct bimodal
behavior that can be used to characterize the stochastic signaling in type 2
apoptosis. Interestingly, such stochastic fluctuations in apoptosis signaling
happen even in the presence of large numbers of signaling molecules. In a
fluctuating environment, such stochasticity in the timecourse of caspase-3
activation may be an adaptive mechanism for allowing a competing survival
signal to win over a weak death trigger before the critical cell fate decision
is made and thus minimizes the risk of pathologies.
"
What are the atmospheric conditions valid for the model of dunes on Mars?,"  We apply a model for sand dunes to calculate formation of dunes on Mars under
the present Martian atmospheric conditions. We find that different dune shapes
as those imaged by Mars Global Surveyor could have been formed by the action of
sand-moving winds occuring on today's Mars. Our calculations show, however,
that Martian dunes could be only formed due to the higher efficiency of Martian
winds in carrying grains into saltation. The model equations are solved to
study saltation transport under different atmospheric conditions valid for
Mars. We obtain an estimate for the wind speed and migration velocity of
barchan dunes at different places on Mars. From comparison with the shape of
bimodal sand dunes, we find an estimate for the timescale of the changes in
Martian wind regimes.
"
What is the nature of the intense magnetic field in compact objects?,"  We construct magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) similarity rebound shocks joining
`quasi-static' asymptotic solutions around the central degenerate core to
explore an MHD model for the evolution of random magnetic field in supernova
explosions. This provides a theoretical basis for further studying synchrotron
diagnostics, MHD shock acceleration of cosmic rays, and the nature of intense
magnetic field in compact objects. The magnetic field strength in space
approaches a limiting ratio, that is comparable to the ratio of the ejecta mass
driven out versus the progenitor mass, during this self-similar rebound MHD
shock evolution. The intense magnetic field of the remnant compact star as
compared to that of the progenitor star is mainly attributed to both the
gravitational core collapse and the radial distribution of magnetic field.
"
What is the analogue of Szego's limit theorem in free probability theory?,"  In the paper, we discuss orthogonal polynomials in free probability theory.
Especially, we prove an analogue of of Szego's limit theorem in free
probability theory.
"
What is the power-law relationship between the velocity of the interface and the thermal exponent?,"  We study thermal effects at the depinning transition by numerical simulations
of driven one-dimensional elastic interfaces in a disordered medium. We find
that the velocity of the interface, evaluated at the critical depinning force,
can be correctly described with the power law $v\sim T^\psi$, where $\psi$ is
the thermal exponent. Using the sample-dependent value of the critical force,
we precisely evaluate the value of $\psi$ directly from the temperature
dependence of the velocity, obtaining the value $\psi = 0.15 \pm 0.01$. By
measuring the structure factor of the interface we show that both the
thermally-rounded and the T=0 depinning, display the same large-scale geometry,
described by an identical divergence of a characteristic length with the
velocity $\xi \propto v^{-\nu/\beta}$, where $\nu$ and $\beta$ are respectively
the T=0 correlation and depinning exponents. We discuss the comparison of our
results with previous estimates of the thermal exponent and the direct
consequences for recent experiments on magnetic domain wall motion in
ferromagnetic thin films.
"
What is the classification of nilpotent G-orbits in the Lie algebra of G?,"  Let G be a connected reductive linear algebraic group defined over an
algebraically closed field of characteristic p. Assume that p is good for G. In
this note we classify all the spherical nilpotent G-orbits in the Lie algebra
of G. The classification is the same as in the characteristic zero case
obtained by D.I. Panyushev in 1994: for e a nilpotent element in the Lie
algebra of G, the G-orbit G.e is spherical if and only if the height of e is at
most 3.
"
What are the results of the numerical simulations in a one-dimensional model?,"  We discuss dynamics of a slow quantum phase transition in a spin-1
Bose-Einstein condensate. We determine analytically the scaling properties of
the system magnetization and verify them with numerical simulations in a one
dimensional model.
"
What is the resonating valence bond (RVB) state and how is it related to the behavior of frustrated antiferromagnets?,"  A three-dimensional system of interacting spins typically develops static
long-range order when it is cooled. If the spins are quantum (S = 1/2),
however, novel quantum paramagnetic states may appear. The most highly sought
state among them is the resonating valence bond (RVB) state in which every pair
of neighboring quantum spins form entangled spin singlets (valence bonds) and
the singlets are quantum mechanically resonating amongst all the possible
highly degenerate pairing states. Here we provide experimental evidence for
such quantum paramagnetic states existing in frustrated antiferromagnets,
ZnxCu4-x(OD)6Cl2, where the S = 1/2 magnetic Cu2+ moments form layers of a
two-dimensional kagome lattice. We find that in Cu4(OD)6Cl2, where distorted
kagome planes are weakly coupled to each other, a dispersionless excitation
mode appears in the magnetic excitation spectrum below ~ 20 K, whose
characteristics resemble those of quantum spin singlets in a solid state, known
as a valence bond solid (VBS), that breaks translational symmetry. Doping
nonmagnetic Zn2+ ions reduces the distortion of the kagome lattice, and weakens
the interplane coupling but also dilutes the magnetic occupancy of the kagome
lattice. The VBS state is suppressed and for ZnCu3(OD)6Cl2 where the kagome
planes are undistorted and 90% occupied by the Cu2+ ions, the low energy spin
fluctuations in the spin liquid phase become featureless.
"
What are the implications of the reentrant magnetic ordering with the increase of elliptical deformation?,"  We study the influence of deformations on magnetic ordering in quantum dots
doped with magnetic impurities. The reduction of symmetry and the associated
deformation from circular to elliptical quantum confinement lead to the
formation of piezomagnetic quantum dots. The strength of elliptical deformation
can be controlled by the gate voltage to change the magnitude of magnetization,
at a fixed number of carriers and in the absence of applied magnetic field. We
reveal a reentrant magnetic ordering with the increase of elliptical
deformation and suggest that the piezomagnetic quantum dots can be used as
nanoscale magnetic switches.
"
What are the scaling relations for clusters with giant radio halos in the re-acceleration scenario?,"  In this paper we derive new expected scaling relations for clusters with
giant radio halos in the framework of the re-acceleration scenario in a
simplified, but physically motivated, form, namely: radio power (P_R) vs size
of the radio emitting region (R_H), and P_R vs total cluster mass (M_H)
contained in the emitting region and cluster velocity dispersion (sigma_H) in
this region.
  We search for these correlations by analyzing the most recent radio and X-ray
data available in the literature for a well known sample of clusters with giant
radio halos. In particular we find a good correlation between P_R and R_H and a
very tight ``geometrical'' scaling between M_H and R_H. From these correlations
P_R is also expected to scale with M_H and sigma_H and this is confirmed by our
analysis. We show that all the observed trends can be well reconciled with
expectations in the case of a slight variation of the mean magnetic field
strength in the radio halo volume with M_H. A byproduct correlation between R_H
and sigma_H is also found, and can be further tested by optical studies. In
addition, we find that observationally R_H scales non-linearly with the virial
radius of the host cluster, and this immediately means that the fraction of the
cluster volume which is radio emitting increases with cluster mass and thus
that the non-thermal component in clusters is not self-similar.
"
What are the systematic and statistical uncertainties in the measured branching fractions?,"  Using a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 342
$fb^{-1}$ collected with the BABAR detector at the SLAC PEP-II
electron-positron storage ring operating at a center-of-mass energy near 10.58
GeV, we measure ${\cal{B}} (\tau^- \to \pi^- \pi^- \pi^+ \nu_\tau) = (8.83 \pm
0.01 \pm 0.13) %$, ${\cal{B}} (\tau^- \to K^- \pi^- \pi^+ \nu_\tau) = (0.273\pm
0.002\pm 0.009)%$, ${\cal{B}} (\tau^- \to K^- \pi^- K^+ \nu_\tau) = (0.1346\pm
0.0010 \pm 0.0036)%$ and ${\cal{B}} (\tau^- \to K^- K^- K^+ \nu_\tau) =
(1.58\pm 0.13 \pm 0.12)\times 10^{-5}$, where the uncertainties are statistical
and systematic, respectively. Events where the $\pi^+\pi^-$ pair is consistent
with coming from a $K^0_S$ are excluded. These are significant improvements
over previous measurements, with the ${\cal{B}} (\tau^- \to K^- K^- K^+
\nu_\tau)$ result being the first resonant plus non-resonant measurement of
this mode. We also report a first measurement of ${\cal{B}} (\tau^- \to
\phi\pi^- \nu_\tau) = (3.42\pm 0.55 \pm 0.25)\times 10^{-5}$ and a new
measurement of ${\cal{B}} (\tau^- \to \phi K^- \nu_\tau) = (3.39\pm 0.20 \pm
0.28)\times 10^{-5}$.
"
What are the effects of induced magnetization on the transport properties of graphene?,"  Magnetic gates in close proximity to graphene can induce ferromagnetic
correlations. We study the effect of such induced magnetization dependent
Zeeman splittings on the graphene transport properties. We estimate that
induced spin splittings of the order of \Delta ~ 5 meV could be achieved with
the use of magnetic insulator gates, e.g. EuO-gates, deposited on top of
graphene. We demonstrate that such splittings in proximity induced
ferromagnetic graphene could be determined directly from the tunneling
resonances in the linear response conductance, as the top gate creates also a
tunable barrier in the graphene layer. We show how such splittings could also
be determined independently by magnetoresistance measurements in a spin-valve
geometry. Because the spin polarization of the current near the Dirac point
increases with the length of the barrier, long magnetic gates are desirable for
determining \Delta experimentally.
"
What is the alternative interpretation of the broadening observed in the diffusive peak?,"  The study of diffusion and low frequency vibrational motions of particles on
metal surfaces is of paramount importance; it provides valuable information on
the nature of the adsorbate-substrate and the substrate-substrate interactions.
In particular, the experimental broadening observed in the diffusive peak with
increasing coverage is usually interpreted in terms of a dipole-dipole like
interaction among adsorbates via extensive molecular dynamics calculations
within the Langevin framework. Here we present an alternative way to interpret
this broadening by means of a purely stochastic description, namely the
interacting single adsorbate approximation, where two noise sources are
considered: (1) a Gaussian white noise accounting for the surface friction and
temperature, and (2) a white shot noise replacing the interaction potential
between adsorbates. Standard Langevin numerical simulations for flat and
corrugated surfaces (with a separable potential) illustrate the dynamics of Na
atoms on a Cu(100) surface which fit fairly well to the analytical expressions
issued from simple models (free particle and anharmonic oscillator) when the
Gaussian approximation is assumed. A similar broadening is also expected for
the frustrated translational mode peaks.
"
What are the conditions for the speed-up decay of superradiance?,"  In the previous report, we have demonstrated cascade branching channels of
the multipolar E3 transition of rhodium Mossbauer gamma via the time- and
energy-resolved spectroscopy. Moreover, superradiance in the Borrmann channel
from inverted nuclei gives gamma entanglement. In this letter, we report
further four observations of superradiance and its associated gamma
entanglement at the liquid-nitrogen temperature, i.e. (i) speed-up decay, (ii)
immediate recovery of the speed-up decay after quenching, (iii) simultaneous
suppression of gamma and K lines, and (iv) enhanced multiple ionizations.
Anisotropic superradiant channels open by quenching and recover back
immediately after quenching. Enhanced K satellites and K hypersatellites
induced by cooling are attributed to the inelastic scattering of more than
three entangled gammas.
"
What is the relationship between the Heegaard Floer homology and the fibres over the circle with a fibre of negative Euler characteristic?,"  Given a closed 3--manifold $Y$, we show that the Heegaard Floer homology
determines whether $Y$ fibres over the circle with a fibre of negative Euler
characteristic. This is an analogue of an earlier result about knots proved by
Ghiggini and the author.
"
What are the conditions for a realistic measurement process to reach a ground state?,"  We apply quantum filtering and control to a particle in a harmonic trap under
continuous position measurement, and show that a simple static feedback law can
be used to cool the system. The final steady state is Gaussian and dependent on
the feedback strength and coupling between the system and probe. In the limit
of weak coupling this final state becomes the ground state. An earlier model by
Haine et. al. (PRA 69, 2004) without measurement back-action showed dark
states: states that did not display error signals, thus remaining unaffected by
the control. This paper shows that for a realistic measurement process this is
not true, which indicates that a Bose-Einstein condensate may be driven towards
the ground state from any arbitrary initial state.
"
What are the conditions for the generating functional and the spectrum of the mirror theory to be well defined?,"  We show, using exact lattice chirality, that partition functions of lattice
gauge theories with vectorlike fermion representations can be split into
""light"" and ""mirror"" parts, such that the ""light"" and ""mirror"" representations
are chiral. The splitting of the full partition function into ""light"" and
""mirror"" is well defined only if the two sectors are separately anomaly free.
We show that only then is the generating functional, and hence the spectrum, of
the mirror theory a smooth function of the gauge field background. This
explains how ideas to use additional non-gauge, high-scale mirror-sector
dynamics to decouple the mirror fermions without breaking the gauge
symmetry--for example, in symmetric phases at strong mirror Yukawa
coupling--are forced to respect the anomaly-free condition when combined with
the exact lattice chiral symmetry. Our results also explain a paradox posed by
a recent numerical study of the mirror-fermion spectrum in a toy
would-be-anomalous two-dimensional theory. In passing, we prove some general
properties of the partition functions of arbitrary chiral theories on the
lattice that should be of interest for further studies in this field.
"
What are the physical parameters related to the black holes in obscured quasars estimated using the SED modeling?,"  Aims: We aim at estimating the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) and the
physical parameters related to the black holes harbored in eight high
X-ray-to-optical (F_X/F_R>10) obscured quasars at z>0.9 selected in the 2--10
keV band from the HELLAS2XMM survey.
  Methods: We use IRAC and MIPS 24 micron observations, along with optical and
Ks-band photometry, to obtain the SEDs of the sources. The observed SEDs are
modeled using a combination of an elliptical template and torus emission (using
the phenomenological templates of Silva et al. 2004) for six sources associated
with passive galaxies; for two point-like sources, the empirical SEDs of red
quasars are adopted. The bolometric luminosities and the M_BH-L_K relation are
used to provide an estimate of the masses and Eddington ratios of the black
holes residing in these AGN.
  Results: All of our sources are detected in the IRAC and MIPS (at 24 micron)
bands. The SED modeling described above is in good agreement with the observed
near- and mid-infrared data. The derived bolometric luminosities are in the
range ~10^45-10^47 erg s^-1, and the median 2--10 keV bolometric correction is
~25, consistent with the widely adopted value derived by Elvis et al. (1994).
For the objects with elliptical-like profiles in the K_s band, we derive high
stellar masses (0.8-6.2)X10^11 Mo, black hole masses in the range
(0.2-2.5)X10^9 Mo, and Eddington ratios L/L_Edd<0.1, suggesting a low-accretion
phase.
"
What is the relationship between the Sobolev-type regularity of functionals on Wiener space and the Malliavin Calculus?,"  Malliavin Calculus is about Sobolev-type regularity of functionals on Wiener
space, the main example being the Ito map obtained by solving stochastic
differential equations. Rough path analysis is about strong regularity of
solution to (possibly stochastic) differential equations. We combine arguments
of both theories and discuss existence of a density for solutions to stochastic
differential equations driven by a general class of non-degenerate Gaussian
processes, including processes with sample path regularity worse than Brownian
motion.
"
What are the theoretical uncertainties in the prediction of time-dependent CP asymmetries in b to s penguin decays?,"  We review the theoretical status of b to s hadronic penguin decays in the
Standard Model and beyond. We summarize the main theoretical tools to compute
Branching Ratios and CP asymmetries for b to s penguin dominated nonleptonic
decays, and discuss the theoretical uncertainties in the prediction of
time-dependent CP asymmetries in this processes. We consider general aspects of
b to s transitions beyond the Standard Model. Then we present detailed
predictions in supersymmetric models with new sources of flavor and CP
violation.
"
What are the state models of Jones and Alexander polynomials extended to polynomials with d+1 variables?,"  We extend the state models for Jones and Alexander polynomials of classical
links to state models of 2-variable polynomials in the case of singular links.
Moreover, we extend both of them to polynomials with d+1 variables for long
singular knots with exactly d double points. These extensions can detect
non-invertibility of long singular knots.
"
What is the decision procedure for the first-order constraint satisfaction problem in the theory T?,"  We present in this paper a first-order axiomatization of an extended theory
$T$ of finite or infinite trees, built on a signature containing an infinite
set of function symbols and a relation $\fini(t)$ which enables to distinguish
between finite or infinite trees. We show that $T$ has at least one model and
prove its completeness by giving not only a decision procedure, but a full
first-order constraint solver which gives clear and explicit solutions for any
first-order constraint satisfaction problem in $T$. The solver is given in the
form of 16 rewriting rules which transform any first-order constraint $\phi$
into an equivalent disjunction $\phi$ of simple formulas such that $\phi$ is
either the formula $\true$ or the formula $\false$ or a formula having at least
one free variable, being equivalent neither to $\true$ nor to $\false$ and
where the solutions of the free variables are expressed in a clear and explicit
way. The correctness of our rules implies the completeness of $T$. We also
describe an implementation of our algorithm in CHR (Constraint Handling Rules)
and compare the performance with an implementation in C++ and that of a recent
decision procedure for decomposable theories.
"
What is the exponential convergence of the solutions to the equilibrium in the Fokker-Planck equations?,"  We study a class of nonlinear kinetic Fokker-Planck type equations modeling
quantum particles which obey the Bose-Einstein and Fermi-Dirac statistics,
respectively. We establish the existence of classical solutions in the
perturbative regime and prove exponential convergence towards the equilibrium.
"
What is the cosmic string contribution to the cosmic microwave background polarization spectra?,"  We present the first calculation of the possible (local) cosmic string
contribution to the cosmic microwave background polarization spectra from
simulations of a string network (rather than a stochastic collection of
unconnected string segments). We use field theory simulations of the Abelian
Higgs model to represent local U(1) strings, including their radiative decay
and microphysics. Relative to previous estimates, our calculations show a shift
in power to larger angular scales, making the chance of a future cosmic string
detection from the B-mode polarization slightly greater. We explore a future
ground-based polarization detector, taking the CLOVER project as our example.
In the null hypothesis (that cosmic strings make a zero contribution) we find
that CLOVER should limit the string tension \mu to G\mu<0.12e-6 (where G is the
gravitational constant), above which it is likely that a detection would be
possible.

What is the criterion for a recollement of a derived category of a symmetric ring spectrum?,"  We prove two results from Morita theory of stable model categories. Both can
be regarded as topological versions of recent algebraic theorems. One is on
recollements of triangulated categories, which have been studied in the
algebraic case by J{\o}rgensen. We give a criterion which answers the following
question: When is there a recollement for the derived category of a given
symmetric ring spectrum in terms of two other symmetric ring spectra? The other
result is on well generated triangulated categories in the sense of Neeman.
Porta characterizes the algebraic well generated categories as localizations of
derived categories of DG categories. We prove a topological analogon: a
topological triangulated category is well generated if and only if it is
triangulated equivalent to a localization of the derived category of a
symmetric ring spectrum with several objects. Here `topological' means
triangulated equivalent to the homotopy category of a spectral model category.
Moreover, we show that every well generated spectral model category is Quillen
equivalent to a Bousfield localization of a category of modules via a single
Quillen functor.

"What is the relationship between the closure of a Teichm\""uller disc in the stratum Q(1,1,1,1) and the GL^+_2(R)-invariant locus L of translation surfaces of genus three?","  In this paper, we investigate the closure of a large class of Teichm\""uller
discs in the stratum Q(1,1,1,1) or equivalently, in a GL^+_2(R)-invariant locus
L of translation surfaces of genus three. We describe a systematic way to prove
that the GL^+_2(R)-orbit closure of a translation surface in L is the whole of
L. The strategy of the proof is an analysis of completely periodic directions
on such a surface and an iterated application of Ratner's theorem to unipotent
subgroups acting on an ``adequate'' splitting. This analysis applies for
example to all Teichmueller discs stabilized obtained by Thurston's
construction with a trace field of degree three which moreover ``obviously not
Veech''. We produce an infinite series of such examples and show moreover that
the favourable splitting situation does not arise everywhere on L, contrary to
the situation in genus two. We also study completely periodic directions on
translation surfaces in L. For instance, we prove that completely periodic
directions are dense on surfaces obtained by Thurston's construction.
"
What are the Faber polynomials F_n(z) associated to the function g(w)?,"  For a function g(w) analytic and univalent in {w:1<|w|<\infty} with a simple
pole at \infty and a continuous extension to {w:|w|\geq 1}, we consider the
Faber polynomials F_n(z), n=0,1,2,..., associated to g(w) via their generating
function g'(w)/(g(w)-z)=\sum_{n=0}^\infty F_n(z)w^{-(n+1)}. Assuming that g(w)
maps the unit circle T onto a piecewise analytic curve L whose exterior domain
has no outward-pointing cusps, and under an additional assumption concerning
the ""Lehman expansion"" of g(w) about those points of T mapped onto corners of
L, we obtain asymptotic formulas for F_n(z) that yield fine results on the
location, limiting distribution and accumulation points of the zeros of the
Faber polynomials. The asymptotic formulas are shown to hold uniformly and the
exact rate of decay of the error terms involved is provided.
"
What is the relationship between the observed spin wave modes and the saturation magnetization?,"  We study the decay of Ds meson into final states involving a Ks and report
the discovery of Cabibbo suppressed decay modes Ds -> Kspi-pi+pi+ (179 +/- 36
events) and Ds -> Kspi+ (113 +/-26 events). The branching ratios for the new
modes are Gamma(Ds -> Kspi-pi+pi+)/Gamma(Ds -> KsK-pi+pi+) = 0.18 +/- 0.04 +/-
0.05 and Gamma(Ds -> Kspi+)/Gamma(Ds -> KsK+) = 0.104 +/- 0.024 +/- 0.013.

"What are the canonical foliations of a quaternion CR-submanifold of a quaternion K\""{a}hler manifold?","  The purpose of this paper is to study the canonical foliations of a
quaternion CR-submanifold of a quaternion K\""{a}hler manifold.
"
What are the factors by which initial and final state polarizations improve the sensitivity to the anomalous coupling?,"  We investigate the constraints on the anomalous quartic $W^{+}W^{-}Z\gamma$
gauge boson coupling through the process $e^{-}\gamma\to \nu_{e}W^{-}Z$.
Considering incoming beam polarizations and the longitudinal and transverse
polarization states of the final W and Z boson we find 95% confidence level
limits on the anomalous coupling parameter $a_{n}$ with an integrated
luminosity of 500 $fb^{-1}$ and $\sqrt{s}$=0.5, 1 TeV energies. We show that
initial beam and final state polarizations improve the sensitivity to the
anomalous coupling by up to factors of 2 - 3.5 depending on the energy.
"
What is the framework used to describe the conductivity in semiconductors in the presence of spin scattering?,"  The magnitude of the anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR) and the longitudinal
resistance in compressively strained (Ga0.95, Mn0.05)As epilayers were measured
for the first time down to temperatures as low as 30 mK. Below temperatures of
3K the conductivity decreases ~ T^1/3 over two orders of magnitude in
temperature. The conductivity can be well described within the framework of a
3D scaling theory of Anderson's transition in the presence of spin scattering
in semiconductors. It is shown that the samples are on the metallic side but
very close to the metal-insulator transition (MIT). At lowest temperatures a
decrease in the AMR effect is observed, which is assigned to changes in the
coupling between the remaining itinerant carriers and the local Mn 5/2-spin
moments.
"
How does the temperature distribution on the surface of HD 189733 compare to previous claims about the inefficient redistribution of energy in the atmosphere?,"  ""Hot Jupiter"" extrasolar planets are expected to be tidally locked because
they are close (<0.05 astronomical units, where 1 AU is the average Sun-Earth
distance) to their parent stars, resulting in permanent daysides and
nightsides. By observing systems where the planet and star periodically eclipse
each other, several groups have been able to estimate the temperatures of the
daysides of these planets. A key question is whether the atmosphere is able to
transport the energy incident upon the dayside to the nightside, which will
determine the temperature at different points on the planet's surface. Here we
report observations of HD 189733, the closest of these eclipsing planetary
systems, over half an orbital period, from which we can construct a 'map' of
the distribution of temperatures. We detected the increase in brightness as the
dayside of the planet rotated into view. We estimate a minimum brightness
temperature of 973 +/- 33 K and a maximum brightness temperature of 1212 +/- 11
K at a wavelength of 8 microns, indicating that energy from the irradiated
dayside is efficiently redistributed throughout the atmosphere, in contrast to
a recent claim for another hot Jupiter. Our data indicate that the peak
hemisphere-integrated brightness occurs 16$\pm$6 degrees before opposition,
corresponding to a hot spot shifted east of the substellar point. The secondary
eclipse (when the planet moves behind the star) occurs 120 +/- 24 s later than
predicted, which may indicate a slightly eccentric orbit.
"
What is the heliocentric velocity of the AndXII dwarf spheroidal galaxy?,"  We present spectroscopic observations of the AndXII dwarf spheroidal galaxy
using DEIMOS/Keck-II, showing it to be moving rapidly through the Local Group
(-556 km/s heliocentric velocity, -281 km/s relative to Andromeda from the MW),
falling into the Local Group from ~115 kpc beyond Andromeda's nucleus. AndXII
therefore represents a dwarf galaxy plausibly falling into the Local Group for
the first time, and never having experienced a dense galactic environment. From
Green Bank Telescope observations, a limit on the H{I} gas mass of <3000 Msun
suggests that AndXII's gas could have been removed prior to experiencing the
tides of the Local Group galaxies. Orbit models suggest the dwarf is close to
the escape velocity of M31 for published mass models. AndXII is our best direct
evidence for the late infall of satellite galaxies, a prediction of
cosmological simulations.
"
What is the relationship between the horizontal and vertical components in a random walk on a lattice?,"  We prove a non-standard functional limit theorem for a two dimensional simple
random walk on some randomly oriented lattices. This random walk, already known
to be transient, has different horizontal and vertical fluctuations leading to
different normalizations in the functional limit theorem, with a non-Gaussian
horizontal behavior. We also prove that the horizontal and vertical components
are not asymptotically independent.
"
What is the Max Planck Society's role in the open access movement?,"  The open access agenda of the Max Planck Society, initiator of the Berlin
Declaration, envisions the support of both the green way and the golden way to
open access. For the implementation of the green way the Max Planck Society
through its newly established unit (Max Planck Digital Library) follows the
idea of providing a centralized technical platform for publications and a local
support for editorial issues. With regard to the golden way, the Max Planck
Society fosters the development of open access publication models and
experiments new publishing concepts like the Living Reviews journals.
"
What is the result of the CDF Collaboration analysis of 955/pb of CDF II data for single top quark production?,"  The CDF Collaboration has analyzed 955/pb of CDF II data to search for
electroweak single top quark production at the Tevatron. We employ three
different analysis techniques to search for a single top signal: multivariate
likelihood functions; neural networks; the matrix element analysis technique.
The sensitivities to a single top signal at the rate predicted by the Standard
Model are 2.1 - 2.6 sigma. The first two analyses observe a deficit of single
top-like events and set upper limits on the production cross section. The
matrix element analysis observes a 2.3 sigma single top excess and measures a
combined t-channel and s-channel cross section of 2.7 +1.5-1.3 pb. Using the
same dataset, we have searched for non-Standard Model production of single top
quarks through a heavy W' boson resonance. No evidence for a signal is
observed. We exclude at the 95 % C.L. W' boson production with masses of 760
GeV/c^2 (790 GeV/c^2) in case the right handed neutrino is smaller (larger)
than the mass of the W' boson.
"
What is the equation of state of isospin-asymmetric nuclear matter?,"  Heavy-ion reactions induced by neutron-rich nuclei provide a unique means to
investigate the equation of state of isospin-asymmetric nuclear matter,
especially the density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy. In
particular, recent analyses of the isospin diffusion data in heavy-ion
reactions have already put a stringent constraint on the nuclear symmetry
energy around the nuclear matter saturation density. We review this exciting
result and discuss its implications on nuclear effective interactions and the
neutron skin thickness of heavy nuclei. In addition, we also review the
theoretical progress on probing the high density behaviors of the nuclear
symmetry energy in heavy-ion reactions induced by high energy radioactive
beams.
"
What is the mass ratio distribution of the binary systems in Scorpius OB2?,"  We characterize the binary population in the young and nearby OB association
Scorpius OB2 using available observations of visual, spectroscopic, and
astrometric binaries with intermediate-mass primaries. We take into account
observational biases by comparing the observations with simulated observations
of model associations. The available data indicate a large binary fraction (>
70% with 3sigma confidence), with a large probability that all intermediate
mass stars in Sco OB2 are part of a binary system. The binary systems have a
mass ratio distribution of the form f(q) ~ q^-0.4. Sco OB2 has a semi-major
axis distribution of the form f(log a) ~ constant (Opik's law), in the range
5-5e6 Rsun. The log-normal period distribution of Duquennoy & Mayor results in
too few spectroscopic binaries, even if the model binary fraction is 100%. Sco
OB2 is a young association with a low stellar density; its current population
is expected to be very similar to the primordial population. The fact that
practically all stars in Sco OB2 are part of a binary (or multiple) system
demonstrates that multiplicity is a fundamental factor in the star formation
process, at least for intermediate mass stars.
"
What are the correlations in a two-particle scattering experiment?,"  We consider two quantum coherent conductors interacting weakly via long range
Coulomb forces. We describe the interaction in terms of two-particle collisions
described by a two-particle scattering matrix. As an example we determine the
transmission probability and correlations in a two-particle scattering
experiment and find that the results can be expressed in terms of the
density-of-states matrices of the non-interacting scatterers.
"
Can the microwave photovoltage technique be used to measure spin excitations in a ferromagnetic microstrip?,"  This paper has been withdrawn by the authors due to a crucial error in the
proof of the main result. In a new manuscript (with two new authors) available
at arXiv:1010.2791v1 this problem has been resolved.
"
What is the probability of the generalized n-field slow roll inflation for the universe in the framework of inflationary cosmology?,"  We investigate the measure problem in the framework of inflationary
cosmology. The measure of the history space is constructed and applied to
inflation models. Using this measure, it is shown that the probability for the
generalized single field slow roll inflation to last for $N$ e-folds is
suppressed by a factor $\exp(-3N)$, and the probability for the generalized
$n$-field slow roll inflation is suppressed by a much larger factor
$\exp(-3nN)$. Some non-inflationary models such as the cyclic model do not
suffer from this difficulty.
"
What are the calibration measurements of the GBM instrument for GRBs?,"  The GLAST Burst Monitor (GBM) will augment the capabilities of GLAST for the
detection of cosmic gamma-ray bursts by extending the energy range (20 MeV to >
300 GeV) of the Large Area Telescope (LAT) towards lower energies by 2
BGO-detectors (150 keV to 30 MeV) and 12 NaI(Tl) detectors (10 keV to 1 MeV).
The physical detector response of the GBM instrument for GRBs is determined
with the help of Monte Carlo simulations, which are supported and verified by
on-ground calibration measurements, performed extensively with the individual
detectors at the MPE in 2005. All flight and spare detectors were irradiated
with calibrated radioactive sources in the laboratory (from 14 keV to 4.43
MeV). The energy/channel-relations, the dependences of energy resolution and
effective areas on the energy and the angular responses were measured. Due to
the low number of emission lines of radioactive sources below 100 keV,
calibration measurements in the energy range from 10 keV to 60 keV were
performed with the X-ray radiometry working group of the
Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB) at the BESSY synchrotron radiation
facility, Berlin.
"
What is the hierarchy of equations for the reduced probability densities for a homogeneous gas?,"  A probabilistic analysis of the direct simulation of a homogeneous gas is
given. A hierarchy of equations similar to the BBGKY hierarchy for the reduced
probability densities is derived. By invoking the molecular chaos assumption,
an equation similar to the Boltzmann equation for the single particle
probability density and the corresponding H-theorem is derived.
"
What are the advantages of connecting plasmonic and/or dielectric nanoparticles in series and parallel configurations to create a complex nanocircuit circuit system?,"  Applying the analytical closed-form solutions of the 'quasi-static' potential
distribution around two conjoined resonant half-cylinders with different
permittivities, reported in the first part of our manuscript, here we interpret
these results in terms of our nanocircuit paradigm applicable to nanoparticles
at infrared and optical frequencies [N. Engheta, A. Salandrino, A. Alu, Phys.
Rev. Lett. 95, 095504 (2005)]. We investigate the possibility of connecting in
series and parallel configurations plasmonic and/or dielectric nanoparticles
acting as nanocircuit elements, with a goal for the design of a more complex
nanocircuit circuit system with the desired response. The present analysis
fully validates the heuristic predictions regarding the parallel and series
combination of a pair of nanocircuit elements. Moreover, the geometries under
analysis present interesting peculiar features in their wave interaction, such
as the intermediate stage between the parallel and series configurations, which
may be of interest for certain applications. In particular, the resonant
nanocircuit configuration analyzed here may dramatically change, in a
continuous way, its effective total impedance by simply rotating its
orientation with respect to the polarization of the impressed optical electric
field, providing a novel optical nanodevice that may alter its function by
rotation with respect to the impressed optical local field.
"
What is the relationship between the SWIFT satellite and the improvement of our knowledge of gamma ray bursts and X-ray flashes?,"  Recent data gathered and triggered by the SWIFT satellite have greatly
improved our knowledge of long-duration gamma ray bursts (GRBs) and X-ray
flashes (XRFs). This is particularly the case for the X-ray data at all times,
and for UV and optical data at very early times. I show that the optical and
X-ray observations are in excellent agreement with the predictions of the
""cannonball"" model of GRBs and XRFs. Elementary physics and just two mechanisms
underlie these predictions: inverse Compton scattering and synchrotron
radiation, generally dominant at early and late times, respectively. I put this
result in its proper context and dedicate the paper to those who planed, built
and operate SWIFT, a true flying jewel.
"
What is the operator-valued approach used to derive the system of equations?,"  In a frequency selective slow-fading channel in a MIMO system, the channel
matrix is of the form of a block matrix. We propose a method to calculate the
limit of the eigenvalue distribution of block matrices if the size of the
blocks tends to infinity. We will also calculate the asymptotic eigenvalue
distribution of $HH^*$, where the entries of $H$ are jointly Gaussian, with a
correlation of the form $E[h_{pj}\bar h_{qk}]= \sum_{s=1}^t
\Psi^{(s)}_{jk}\hat\Psi^{(s)}_{pq}$ (where $t$ is fixed and does not increase
with the size of the matrix). We will use an operator-valued free probability
approach to achieve this goal. Using this method, we derive a system of
equations, which can be solved numerically to compute the desired eigenvalue
distribution.
"
What is the effect of a high-frequency signal on the response of a noisy bistable system to a low-frequency subthreshold sinusoidal signal?,"  We study the effects of a high-frequency (HF) signal on the response of a
noisy bistable system to a low-frequency subthreshold sinusoidal signal. We
show that, by conveniently choosing the ratio of the amplitude of the HF signal
to its frequency, stochastic resonance gains greater than unity can be measured
at the low-frequency value. Thus, the addition of the HF signal can entail an
improvement in the detection of weak monochromatic signals. The results are
explained in terms of an effective model and illustrated by means of numerical
simulations.
"
What are the energies of the incident antiproton for the Coulomb glory effect to become more pronounced?,"  Collisions of antiprotons with He-, Ne-, Ni-like, bare, and neutral uranium
are studied theoretically for scattering angles close to 180$^{\circ}$ and
antiproton energies with the interval 100 eV -- 10 keV. We investigate the
Coulomb glory effect which is caused by a screening of the Coulomb potential of
the nucleus and results in a prominent maximum of the differential cross
section in the backward direction at some energies of the incident particle. We
found that for larger numbers of electrons in the ion the effect becomes more
pronounced and shifts to higher energies of the antiproton. On the other hand,
a maximum of the differential cross section in the backward direction can also
be found in the scattering of antiprotons on a bare uranium nucleus. The latter
case can be regarded as a manifestation of the screening property of the
vacuum-polarization potential in non-relativistic collisions of heavy
particles.
"
What are the Markovian dynamics of quantum systems described by Markovian master equations?,"  We characterize the dynamical behavior of continuous-time, Markovian quantum
systems with respect to a subsystem of interest. Markovian dynamics describes a
wide class of open quantum systems of relevance to quantum information
processing, subsystem encodings offering a general pathway to faithfully
represent quantum information. We provide explicit linear-algebraic
characterizations of the notion of invariant and noiseless subsystem for
Markovian master equations, under different robustness assumptions for
model-parameter and initial-state variations. The stronger concept of an
attractive quantum subsystem is introduced, and sufficient existence conditions
are identified based on Lyapunov's stability techniques. As a main control
application, we address the potential of output-feedback Markovian control
strategies for quantum pure state-stabilization and noiseless-subspace
generation. In particular, explicit results for the synthesis of stabilizing
semigroups and noiseless subspaces in finite-dimensional Markovian systems are
obtained.
"
What are the factors that influence the formation of Earth-like planets in the solar system?,"  Extrasolar planetary systems range from hot Jupiters out to icy comet belts
more distant than Pluto. We explain this diversity in a model where the mass of
solids in the primordial circumstellar disk dictates the outcome. The star
retains measures of the initial heavy-element (metal) abundance that can be
used to map solid masses onto outcomes, and the frequencies of all classes are
correctly predicted. The differing dependences on metallicity for forming
massive planets and low-mass cometary bodies are also explained. By
extrapolation, around two-thirds of stars have enough solids to form Earth-like
planets, and a high rate is supported by the first detections of low-mass
exo-planets.
"
What is the temperature dependence of static dielectric susceptibility of a system with strongly coupled fluctuating dipoles?,"  The temperature dependence of static dielectric susceptibility of a system
with strongly coupled fluctuating dipoles is calculated within a self
consistent mean fluctuation field approximation. Results are qualitatively in
good agreement with, a quantum paraelectric, SrTiO$_3$ in the low temperature
regime. We identify this system as a {\it gaped quantum paraelectric} and
suggest a possible experimental realization of a {\it quantum critical
paraelectric} through the application of hydrostatic pressure or doping by
impurity.
"
What are the two types of surface models investigated by Monte Carlo simulations on triangulated spheres?,"  Two types of surface models have been investigated by Monte Carlo simulations
on triangulated spheres with compartmentalized domains. Both models are found
to undergo a first-order collapsing transition and a first-order surface
fluctuation transition. The first model is a fluid surface one. The vertices
can freely diffuse only inside the compartments, and they are prohibited from
the free diffusion over the surface due to the domain boundaries. The second is
a skeleton model. The surface shape of the skeleton model is maintained only by
the domain boundaries, which are linear chains with rigid junctions. Therefore,
we can conclude that the first-order transitions occur independent of whether
the shape of surface is mechanically maintained by the skeleton (= the domain
boundary) or by the surface itself.
"
What are the key concepts in a geometric representation of the Langlands dual group?,"  Let G be a reductive group. The geometric Satake equivalence realized the
category of representations of the Langlands dual group ^LG in terms of
spherical perverse sheaves (or D-modules) on the affine Grassmannian
Gr_G=G((t))/G[[t]] of the original group G.
  In the present paper we perform a first step in realizing the category of
representations of the quantum group corresponding to ^LG in terms of the
geometry of Gr_G.
  The idea of the construction belongs to Jacob Lurie.
"
What is the level statistics of the XXZ spin chains with a constant spatially-inhomogeneous magnetic field?,"  We investigate dynamical stability of the ground state against a
time-periodic and spatially-inhomogeneous magnetic field for finite quantum XXZ
spin chains. We use the survival probability as a measure of stability and
demonstrate that it decays as $P(t) \propto t^{-1/2}$ under a certain
condition. The dynamical properties should also be related to the level
statistics of the XXZ spin chains with a constant spatially-inhomogeneous
magnetic field. The level statistics depends on the anisotropy parameter and
the field strength. We show how the survival probability depends on the
anisotropy parameter, the strength and frequency of the field.
"
What is the MHD instability in the radiation zone of a differentially rotating star?,"  We examine the MHD instabilities arising in the radiation zone of a
differentially rotating star, in which a poloidal field of fossil origin is
sheared into a toroidal field. We focus on the non-axisymmetric instability
that affects the toroidal magnetic field in a rotating star, which was first
studied by Pitts and Tayler in the non-dissipative limit. According to Spruit,
it could also drive a dynamo. The Pitts & Tayler instability is manifestly
present in our simulations, with its conspicuous m=1 dependence in azimuth. But
its analytic treatment used so far is too simplified to be applied to the real
stellar situation. Although the instability generated field reaches an energy
comparable to that of the mean poloidal field, that field seems unaffected by
the instability: it undergoes Ohmic decline, and is neither eroded nor
regenerated by the instability. The toroidal field is produced by shearing the
poloidal field and it draws its energy from the differential rotation. The
small scale motions behave as Alfven waves; they cause negligible
eddy-diffusivity and contribute little to the net transport of angular
momentum. In our simulations we observe no sign of dynamo action, of either
mean field or fluctuation type, up to a magnetic Reynolds number of 10^5.
However the Pitts & Tayler instability is sustained as long as the differential
rotation acting on the poloidal field is able to generate a toroidal field of
sufficient strength.
"
What is the typical shock thickness of unmagnetized shocks that can be mediated by the ion Weibel instability?,"  Relativistic collisionless shocks in electron-ion plasma are thought to occur
in the afterglow phase of Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs), and in other environments
where relativistic flows interact with the interstellar medium. A particular
regime of shocks in an unmagnetized plasma has generated much interest for GRB
applications. In this paper we present ab-initio particle-in-cell simulations
of unmagnetized relativistic electron-ion shocks. Using long-term
2.5-dimensional simulations with ion-electron mass ratios from 16 to 1000 we
resolve the shock formation and reach a steady-state shock structure beyond the
initial transient. We find that even at high ion-electron mass ratios initially
unmagnetized shocks can be effectively mediated by the ion Weibel instability
with a typical shock thickness of ~50 ion skin-depths. Upstream of the shock
the interaction with merging ion current filaments heats the electron
component, so that the postshock flow achieves near equipartition between the
ions and electrons, with electron temperature reaching 50% of the ion
temperature. This energy exchange helps to explain the large electron energy
fraction inferred from GRB afterglow observations.
"
What is the impact of the superconducting state on the magnetic properties in a superlattice?,"  We present a study of interlayer coupling and proximity effects in a
La$_{0.66}$Ca$_{0.33}$MnO$_3$(10 nm)/YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_7$(10 nm) superlattice.
Using element-sensitive x-ray probes, the magnetic state of Mn can be probed
without seeing the strong diamagnetism of the superconductor, which makes this
approach ideal to study changes in the magnetic properties across the
superconducting transition. By a combined experiment using {\it in situ}
transport measurements during polarized soft x-ray measurements, we were able
to see no noticeable influence of the superconducting state on the magnetic
properties and no evidence for magnetic coupling across a 10 nm YBCO layer.
"
What is the efficient way to approximate the noise of a one-qubit system under classical noise with 1/f^\alpha power spectrum?,"  We investigate the generation of quantum operations for one-qubit systems
under classical noise with 1/f^\alpha power spectrum, where 2>\alpha > 0. We
present an efficient way to approximate the noise with a discrete multi-state
Markovian fluctuator. With this method, the average temporal evolution of the
qubit density matrix under 1/f^\alpha noise can be feasibly determined from
recently derived deterministic master equations. We obtain qubit operations
such as quantum memory and the NOT}gate to high fidelity by a gradient based
optimization algorithm. For the NOT gate, the computed fidelities are
qualitatively similar to those obtained earlier for random telegraph noise. In
the case of quantum memory however, we observe a nonmonotonic dependency of the
fidelity on the operation time, yielding a natural access rate of the memory.

"What are the obstructions to deform holomorphic maps of compact, complex, K\""ahler manifolds?","  We study deformations of holomorphic maps of compact, complex, K\""ahler

with fixed codomain.
"
What is the shape of the stacked X-ray spectrum of the detected sources in the Cetus field?,"  The 174 ks Chandra Advanced CCD Imaging Spectrometer exposure of the Large
Area Lyman Alpha Survey (LALA) Cetus field is the second of the two deep
Chandra images on LALA fields. In this paper we present the Chandra X-ray
sources detected in the Cetus field, along with an analysis of X-ray source
counts, stacked X-ray spectrum, and optical identifications. A total of 188
X-ray sources were detected: 174 in the 0.5-7.0 keV band, 154 in the 0.5-2.0
keV band, and 113 in the 2.0-7.0 keV band. The X-ray source counts were derived
and compared with LALA Bootes field (172 ks exposure). Interestingly, we find
consistent hard band X-ray source density, but 36+-12% higher soft band X-ray
source density in Cetus field. The weighted stacked spectrum of the detected
X-ray sources can be fitted by a powerlaw with photon index Gamma = 1.55. Based
on the weighted stacked spectrum, we find that the resolved fraction of the
X-ray background drops from 72+-1% at 0.5-1.0 keV to 63+-4% at 6.0-8.0 keV. The
unresolved spectrum can be fitted by a powerlaw over the range 0.5-7 keV, with
a photon index Gamma = 1.22. We also present optical counterparts for 154 of
the X-ray sources, down to a limiting magnitude of r' = 25.9 (Vega), using a
deep r' band image obtained with the MMT.
"
How is the conjecture verified for a given elliptic curve?,"  Let E be an elliptic curved defined over $\Q$ and let $K/\Q$ be a finite
Galois extension with Galois group G. The equivariant Birch-Swinnerton-Dyer
conjecture for $h^1(E\times_{\Q} K)(1)$ viewed as a motive over $\Q$ with
coefficients in $\Q[G]$ relates the twisted L-values associated with E with the
arithmetic invariants of the same. In this paper we prescribe an approach to
verify this conjecture for a given data. Using this approach, we verify the
conjecture for an elliptic curve of conductor 11 and an S_3-extension of $\Q$.
"
How is the DOS of the dot affected by the Kondo resonance?,"  We study the spin-valley Kondo effect of a silicon quantum dot occupied by $%
\mathcal{N}$ electrons, with $\mathcal{N}$ up to four. We show that the Kondo
resonance appears in the $\mathcal{N}=1,2,3$ Coulomb blockade regimes, but not
in the $\mathcal{N}=4$ one, in contrast to the spin-1/2 Kondo effect, which
only occurs at $\mathcal{N}=$ odd. Assuming large orbital level spacings, the
energy states of the dot can be simply characterized by fourfold spin-valley
degrees of freedom. The density of states (DOS) is obtained as a function of
temperature and applied magnetic field using a finite-U equation-of-motion
approach. The structure in the DOS can be detected in transport experiments.
The Kondo resonance is split by the Zeeman splitting and valley splitting for
double- and triple-electron Si dots, in a similar fashion to single-electron
ones. The peak structure and splitting patterns are much richer for the
spin-valley Kondo effect than for the pure spin Kondo effect.
"
What is the shape of the equivalent width distribution of z = 3.1 Ly-alpha emission-line galaxies?,"  We describe the results of an extremely deep, 0.28 deg^2 survey for z = 3.1
Ly-alpha emission-line galaxies in the Extended Chandra Deep Field South. By
using a narrow-band 5000 Anstrom filter and complementary broadband photometry
from the MUSYC survey, we identify a statistically complete sample of 162
galaxies with monochromatic fluxes brighter than 1.5 x 10^-17 ergs cm^-2 s^-1
and observers frame equivalent widths greater than 80 Angstroms. We show that
the equivalent width distribution of these objects follows an exponential with
a rest-frame scale length of w_0 = 76 +/- 10 Angstroms. In addition, we show
that in the emission line, the luminosity function of Ly-alpha galaxies has a
faint-end power-law slope of alpha = -1.49 +/- 0.4, a bright-end cutoff of log
L^* = 42.64 +/- 0.2, and a space density above our detection thresholds of 1.46
+/- 0.12 x 10^-3 h70^3 galaxies Mpc^-3. Finally, by comparing the emission-line
and continuum properties of the LAEs, we show that the star-formation rates
derived from Ly-alpha are ~3 times lower than those inferred from the
rest-frame UV continuum. We use this offset to deduce the existence of a small
amount of internal extinction within the host galaxies. This extinction,
coupled with the lack of extremely-high equivalent width emitters, argues that
these galaxies are not primordial Pop III objects, though they are young and
relatively chemically unevolved.

What are the spectroscopic factors used to calculate the reaction cross-sections for the surrogate reaction technique?,"  We study the spin-parity distribution P(J$^{\pi}$,E) of $^{156}$Gd excited
states above the neutron separation energy that are expected to be populated
via the neutron pickup reaction $^{157}$Gd($^{3}$He,$^{4}$He)$^{156}$Gd. In
general, modeling of the spin-parity distribution is important for the
applicability of the surrogate reaction technique as a method of deducing
reaction cross sections. We model excited states in $^{156}$Gd as rotational
states built on intrinsic states consisting of a hole in the core where the
hole represents neutron removal form a deformed single particle state. The
reaction cross section to each excited state is calculated using standard
reaction code that uses spherical reaction form-factor input. The spectroscopic
factor associated with each form-factor is the expansion coefficient of the
deformed neutron state in a spherical Sturmian basis consisting of the
spherical reaction form-factors.
"
What is the relationship between the Zeeman energy and the spin current in a quantum dot with Zeeman split levels?,"  We report spin-dependent quantum coherent oscillations (ringing) and beats of
the total and spin currents flowing through a quantum dot with Zeeman split
levels. The spin dependent transport is calculated via nonequilibrium Green
function in the transient after a bias voltage is turned on at t=0. The dot is
coupled to two electrodes that can be ferromagnetic or nonmagnetic. In the
ferromagnetic case both parallel and antiparallel alignments are considered.
The coherent oscillation and beat frequencies are controlled via the Zeeman
energy E_Z. In particular, for E_Z=0 no beats are observed and the spin current
is zero for nonmagnetic leads. In the ferromagnetic case a finite spin current
is found for E_Z=0. The effects of temperature are also analyzed. We observe
that with increasing temperature the ringing response and the beats tend to
disappear. Additionally, the spin current goes to zero for nonmagnetic leads,
remaining finite in the ferromagnetic case. The tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR)
also reveals quantum coherent oscillations and beats, and it attains negative
values for small enough temperatures and short times.
"
What is the significance of the connection between the k-resolved optical oscillator strength of interband transitions and the Berry curvatures in ferromagnetic systems?,"  Inversion symmetry breaking allows contrasted circular dichroism in different
k-space regions, which takes the extreme form of optical selection rules for
interband transitions at high symmetry points. In materials where band-edges
occur at noncentral valleys, this enables valley dependent interplay of
electrons with light of different circular polarizations, in analogy to spin
dependent optical activities in semiconductors. This discovery is in perfect
harmony with the previous finding of valley contrasted Bloch band features of
orbital magnetic moment and Berry curvatures from inversion symmetry breaking
[Phys. Rev. Lett. 99, 236809 (2007)]. A universal connection is revealed
between the k-resolved optical oscillator strength of interband transitions,
the orbital magnetic moment and the Berry curvatures, which also provides a
principle for optical measurement of orbital magnetization and intrinsic
anomalous Hall conductivity in ferromagnetic systems. The general physics is
demonstrated in graphene where inversion symmetry breaking leads to valley
contrasted optical selection rule for interband transitions. We discuss
graphene based valley optoelectronics applications where light polarization
information can be interconverted with electronic information.
"
What are the implications of the twinness of node pairs for ancestral relationships in protein interaction networks?,"  We propose a biologically motivated quantity, twinness, to evaluate local
similarity between nodes in a network. The twinness of a pair of nodes is the
number of connected, labeled subgraphs of size n in which the two nodes possess
identical neighbours. The graph animal algorithm is used to estimate twinness
for each pair of nodes (for subgraph sizes n=4 to n=12) in four different
protein interaction networks (PINs). These include an Escherichia coli PIN and
three Saccharomyces cerevisiae PINs -- each obtained using state-of-the-art
high throughput methods. In almost all cases, the average twinness of node
pairs is vastly higher than expected from a null model obtained by switching
links. For all n, we observe a difference in the ratio of type A twins (which
are unlinked pairs) to type B twins (which are linked pairs) distinguishing the
prokaryote E. coli from the eukaryote S. cerevisiae. Interaction similarity is
expected due to gene duplication, and whole genome duplication paralogues in S.
cerevisiae have been reported to co-cluster into the same complexes. Indeed, we
find that these paralogous proteins are over-represented as twins compared to
pairs chosen at random. These results indicate that twinness can detect
ancestral relationships from currently available PIN data.
"
What is the relation between the p-adic and classical situations?,"  We formulate a conjectural p-adic analogue of Borel's theorem relating
regulators for higher K-groups of number fields to special values of the
corresponding zeta-functions, using syntomic regulators and p-adic L-functions.
We also formulate a corresponding conjecture for Artin motives, and state a
conjecture about the precise relation between the p-adic and classical
situations. Parts of he conjectures are proved when the number field (or Artin
motive) is Abelian over the rationals, and all conjectures are verified
numerically in some other cases.
"
What are the coloring complexes in terms of hyperplane arrangements?,"  Steingrimsson's coloring complex and Jonsson's unipolar complex are
interpreted in terms of hyperplane arrangements. This viewpoint leads to short
proofs that all coloring complexes and a large class of unipolar complexes have
convex ear decompositions. These convex ear decompositions impose strong new
restrictions on the chromatic polynomials of all finite graphs. Similar results
are obtained for characteristic polynomials of submatroids of type B_n
arrangements.
"
What is the trend in the growth of the ground-state geometries of sodium clusters?,"  Density-functional theory has been applied to investigate systematics of
sodium clusters Na_n in the size range of n= 39-55. A clear evolutionary trend
in the growth of their ground-state geometries emerges. The clusters at the
beginning of the series (n=39-43) are symmetric and have partial icosahedral
(two-shell) structure. The growth then goes through a series of disordered
clusters (n=44-52) where the icosahedral core is lost. However, for n>52 a
three shell icosahedral structure emerges. This change in the nature of the
geometry is abrupt. In addition, density-functional molecular dynamics has been
used to calculate the specific heat curves for the representative sizes n= 43,
45, 48 and 52. These results along with already available thermodynamic
calculations for n= 40, 50, and 55 enable us to carry out a detailed comparison
of the heat capacity curves with their respective geometries for the entire
series. Our results clearly bring out strong correlation between the evolution
of the geometries and the nature of the shape of the heat capacities. The
results also firmly establish the size-sensitive nature of the heat capacities
in sodium clusters.
"
What are the key concepts in a quantum information processing model for teleportation?,"  A novel way of picturing the processing of quantum information is described,
allowing a direct visualization of teleportation of quantum states and
providing a simple and intuitive understanding of this fascinating phenomenon.
The discussion is aimed at providing physicists a method of explaining
teleportation to non-scientists. The basic ideas of quantum physics are first
explained in lay terms, after which these ideas are used with a graphical
description, out of which teleportation arises naturally.
"
What are the key differences between the proposed LADA algorithms for grid networks and general wireless networks?,"  Existing works on distributed consensus explore linear iterations based on
reversible Markov chains, which contribute to the slow convergence of the
algorithms. It has been observed that by overcoming the diffusive behavior of
reversible chains, certain nonreversible chains lifted from reversible ones mix
substantially faster than the original chains. In this paper, we investigate
the idea of accelerating distributed consensus via lifting Markov chains, and
propose a class of Location-Aided Distributed Averaging (LADA) algorithms for
wireless networks, where nodes' coarse location information is used to
construct nonreversible chains that facilitate distributed computing and
cooperative processing. First, two general pseudo-algorithms are presented to
illustrate the notion of distributed averaging through chain-lifting. These
pseudo-algorithms are then respectively instantiated through one LADA algorithm
on grid networks, and one on general wireless networks. For a $k\times k$ grid
network, the proposed LADA algorithm achieves an $\epsilon$-averaging time of
$O(k\log(\epsilon^{-1}))$. Based on this algorithm, in a wireless network with
transmission range $r$, an $\epsilon$-averaging time of
$O(r^{-1}\log(\epsilon^{-1}))$ can be attained through a centralized algorithm.
Subsequently, we present a fully-distributed LADA algorithm for wireless
networks, which utilizes only the direction information of neighbors to
construct nonreversible chains. It is shown that this distributed LADA
algorithm achieves the same scaling law in averaging time as the centralized
scheme. Finally, we propose a cluster-based LADA (C-LADA) algorithm, which,
requiring no central coordination, provides the additional benefit of reduced
message complexity compared with the distributed LADA algorithm.
"
What is the computational time complexity of simple stochastic game problems?,"  In this paper we survey the computational time complexity of assorted simple
stochastic game problems, and we give an overview of the best known algorithms
associated with each problem.
"
What are the ground states of the Shastry-Sutherland model?,"  We study the competition between antiferromagnetic order and valence bond
solid formation in a two-dimensional frustrated spin-1/2 model. The J1-J2 model
on the square lattice is further frustrated by introducing products of
three-spin projectors which stabilize four dimer-product states as degenerate
ground states. These four states are reminiscent of the dimerized singlet
ground state of the Shastry-Sutherland model. Using exact diagonalizations, we
study the evolution of the ground state by varying theratio of interactions.
For a large range of parameters (J2 > 0.25J1), our model shows a direct
transition between the valence-bond-solid phase and the collinear
antiferromagnetic phase. For small values of J2, several intermediate phases
appear which are also analyzed.
"
What is the role of the CMS in validating the perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics and providing information on the gluon distribution in the nucleons?,"  We present simulation results of $\gamma$ + Jet analysis using CMS (Compact
Muon Solenoid) Object-Oriented software at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC)
center of mass energy $\sqrt{s}$=14 TeV. The study of direct photon production
helps in validating the perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics (pQCD) and
providing information on the gluon distribution in the nucleons. Direct photon
processes also constitute a major background to several other Standard Model
(SM) processes and signals of new physics. Thus these processes need to be
understood precisely in the new energy regime. In this work, we have done a
detailed study of the GEANT4 simulated $\gamma$ + jet events generated with
Pythia, and the related background processes. Isolation cuts have been
optimized for direct photon which improves the signal over background ratio by
$\sim25%$ as compared to previous studies done in CMS. The inclusion of a large
$\Delta\phi$ cut between the photon and the leading jet at $40^0$ in the
analysis leads to a further increase of $\sim15%$ in S/B, thus giving an
overall gain of $\sim42%$ in S/B ratio.
"
What is the proposed control parameter R for systems that show Self Organized Criticality (SOC)?,"  From the starting point of the well known Reynolds number of fluid turbulence
we propose a control parameter $R$ for a wider class of systems including
avalanche models that show Self Organized Criticality (SOC) and ecosystems. $R$
is related to the driving and dissipation rates and from similarity analysis we
obtain a relationship $R\sim N^{\beta_N}$ where $N$ is the number of degrees of
freedom. The value of the exponent $\beta_N$ is determined by detailed
phenomenology but its sign follows from our similarity analysis. For SOC,
$R=h/\epsilon$ and we show that $\beta_N<0$ hence we show independent of the
details that the transition to SOC is when $R \to 0$, in contrast to fluid
turbulence, formalizing the relationship between turbulence (since $\beta_N
>0$, $R \to \infty$) and SOC ($R=h/\epsilon\to 0$). A corollary is that SOC
phenomenology, that is, power law scaling of avalanches, can persist for finite
$R$ with unchanged exponent if the system supports a sufficiently large range
of lengthscales; necessary for SOC to be a candidate for physical systems. We
propose a conceptual model ecosystem where $R$ is an observable parameter which
depends on the rate of throughput of biomass or energy; we show this has
$\beta_N>0$, so that increasing $R$ increases the abundance of species,
pointing to a critical value for species 'explosion'.
"
What is the quantum oscillations of a weakly pinned single scattering target related to the electronic current through a one-dimensional conductor?,"  We consider the electronic current through a one-dimensional conductor in the
ballistic transport regime and show that the quantum oscillations of a weakly
pinned single scattering target results in a temperature- and bias-voltage
independent excess current at large bias voltages. This is a genuine effect on
transport that derives from an exponential reduction of electronic
backscattering in the elastic channel due to quantum delocalization of the
scatterer and from suppression of low-energy electron backscattering in the
inelastic channels caused by the Pauli exclusion principle. We show that both
the mass of the target and the frequency of its quantum vibrations can be
measured by studying the differential conductance and the excess current. We
apply our analysis to the particular case of a weakly pinned C60 molecule
encapsulated by a single-wall carbon nanotube and find that the discussed
phenomena are experimentally observable.
"
What are the factors that determine the output period and three velocities of traveling waves in a system with periodic forces?,"  It has been reported that traveling waves propagate periodically and stably
in sub-excitable systems driven by noise [Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{88}, 138301
(2002)]. As a further investigation, here we observe different types of
traveling waves under different noises and periodic forces, using a simplified
Oregonator model. Depending on different noises and periodic forces, we have
observed different types of wave propagation (or their disappearance).
Moreover, the reversal phenomena are observed in this system based on the
numerical experiments in the one-dimensional space. As an explanation, we
regard it as the effect of periodic forces. Thus, we give qualitative
explanations to how reversal phenomena stably appear, which seem to arise from
the mixing function of the periodic force and the noise. And the output period
and three velocities (the normal, the positive and the negative) of the
travelling waves are defined and their relationship with the periodic forces,
along with the types of waves, are also studied in sub-excitable system under a
fixed noise intensity.
"
What are the two optimization problems considered in the decentralized strategy?,"  In this two-parts paper we propose a decentralized strategy, based on a
game-theoretic formulation, to find out the optimal precoding/multiplexing
matrices for a multipoint-to-multipoint communication system composed of a set
of wideband links sharing the same physical resources, i.e., time and
bandwidth. We assume, as optimality criterion, the achievement of a Nash
equilibrium and consider two alternative optimization problems: 1) the
competitive maximization of mutual information on each link, given constraints
on the transmit power and on the spectral mask imposed by the radio spectrum
regulatory bodies; and 2) the competitive maximization of the transmission
rate, using finite order constellations, under the same constraints as above,
plus a constraint on the average error probability. In Part I of the paper, we
start by showing that the solution set of both noncooperative games is always
nonempty and contains only pure strategies. Then, we prove that the optimal
precoding/multiplexing scheme for both games leads to a channel diagonalizing
structure, so that both matrix-valued problems can be recast in a simpler
unified vector power control game, with no performance penalty. Thus, we study
this simpler game and derive sufficient conditions ensuring the uniqueness of
the Nash equilibrium. Interestingly, although derived under stronger
constraints, incorporating for example spectral mask constraints, our
uniqueness conditions have broader validity than previously known conditions.
Finally, we assess the goodness of the proposed decentralized strategy by
comparing its performance with the performance of a Pareto-optimal centralized
scheme. To reach the Nash equilibria of the game, in Part II, we propose
alternative distributed algorithms, along with their convergence conditions.
"
Is the big trip process in a multiverse model stable and viable?,"  We discuss different arguments that have been raised against the viability of
the big trip process, reaching the conclusions that this process can actually
occur by accretion of phantom energy onto the wormholes and that it is stable
and might occur in the global context of a multiverse model. We finally argue
that the big trip does not contradict any holographic bounds on entropy and
information.
"
What are the degenerated metrics in a symmetric homogeneous space?,"  In this work, we are interested in a non symmetric homogeneous space, namely
$SO(2m)/Sp(m)$. We show that this space admits a structure of $Z_2^2$-symmetric
space. We describe all the non degenerated metrics and classify the Riemannian
and Lorentzian ones.
"
What are the statistics of strong C IV absorbers at z=1.5-3.5 toward gamma-ray bursts?,"  We report on the statistics of strong (W_r > 0.15 A) C IV absorbers at
z=1.5-3.5 toward high-redshift gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). In contrast with a
recent survey for strong Mg II absorption systems at z < 2, we find that the
number of C IV absorbers per unit redshift dN/dz does not show a significant
deviation from previous surveys using quasi-stellar objects (QSOs) as
background sources. We find that the number density of C IV toward GRBs is
dN/dz(z~1.5)= 2.2 +2.8/-1.4, dN/dz(z~2.5)= 2.3 +1.8/-1.1 and dN/dz(z~3.5)= 1.1
+2.6/-0.9. These numbers are consistent with previous C IV surveys using QSO
spectra. Binning the entire dataset, we set a 95% c.l. upper limit to the
excess of C IV absorbers along GRB sightlines at twice the incidence observed
along QSO sightlines. Furthermore, the distribution of equivalent widths of the
GRB and QSO samples are consistent with being drawn from the same parent
population. Although the results for Mg II and C IV absorbers along GRB
sightlines appear to contradict one another, we note that the surveys are
nearly disjoint: the C IV survey corresponds to higher redshift and more highly
ionized gas than the Mg II survey. Nevertheless, analysis on larger statistical
samples may constrain properties of the galaxies hosting these metals (e.g.
mass, dust content) and/or the coherence-length of the gas giving rise to the
metal-line absorption.
"
What is the symmetry-broken energy splitting in a two-dimensional photonic crystal made of evanescently coupled microcavities?,"  Rotation-induced splitting of the otherwise degenerate photonic bands is
predicted for a two-dimensional photonic crystal made of evanescently coupled
microcavities. The symmetry-broken energy splitting is similar to the Zeeman
splitting of atomic levels or electron's (hole's) magnetic moment sublevels in
an external magnetic field. The orbital motion of photons in periodic photonic
lattice of microcavities is shown to enhance significantly such Coriolis-Zeeman
splitting as compared to a solitary microcavity [D.L. Boiko, Optics Express 2,
397 (1998)]. The equation of motion suggests that nonstationary rotation
induces quantum transitions between photonic states and, furthermore, that such
transitions will serve as a source of nonstationary gravitational field.
"
What is the sign of the charge carriers in the KTaO3/SrTiO3 hetero-interface?,"  Electrical transport of a polar heterointerface between two insulating
perovskites, KTaO3 and SrTiO3, is studied. It is formed between a thin KTaO3
film deposited on a top of TiO2- terminated (100) SrTiO3 substrate. The
resulting (KO)1-(TiO2)0 heterointerface is expected to be hole-doped according
to formal valences of K (1+) and Ti (4+). We observed electrical conductivity
and mobility in the KTaO3/SrTiO3 similar to values measured earlier in
electron-doped LaAlO3/SrTiO3 heterointerfaces. However, the sign of the charge
carriers in KTaO3/SrTiO3 obtained from the Hall measurements is negative. The
result is an important clue to the true origin of the doping at perovskite
oxide hetero-interfaces.
"
What are the statistical properties of finite-time stability exponents in the standard map?,"  Some statistical properties of finite-time stability exponents in the
standard map can be estimated analytically. The mean exponent averaged over the
entire phase space behaves quite differently from all the other cumulants.
Whereas the mean carries information about the strength of the interaction, and
only indirect information about dynamical correlations, the higher cumulants
carry information about dynamical correlations and essentially no information
about the interaction strength. In particular, the variance and higher
cumulants of the exponent are very sensitive to dynamical correlations and
easily detect the presence of very small islands of regular motion via their
anomalous time-scalings. The average of the stability matrix' inverse trace is
even more sensitive to the presence of small islands and has a seemingly
fractal behavior in the standard map parameter. The usual accelerator modes and
the small islands created through double saddle node bifurcations, which come
halfway between the positions in interaction strength of the usual accelerator
modes, are clearly visible in the variance, whose time scaling is capable of
detecting the presence of islands as small as 0.01% of the phase space. We
study these quantities with a local approximation to the trace of the stability
matrix which significantly simplifies the numerical calculations as well as
allows for generalization of these methods to higher dimensions. We also
discuss the nature of this local approximation in some detail.
"
What are the effects of selective inhibition of COX-2 with nimesulide on prostaglandin E2 levels and infarct volume in a model of transient focal cerebral ischemia?,"  Several studies suggest that cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 plays a pivotal role in
the progression of ischaemic brain damage. In the present study, we
investigated the effects of selective inhibition of COX-2 with nimesulide (12
mg/kg) and selective inhibition of COX-1 with valeryl salicylate (VAS, 12-120
mg/kg) on prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) levels, myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, Evans
blue (EB) extravasation and infarct volume in a standardized model of transient
focal cerebral ischaemia in the rat. Post-ischaemic treatment with nimesulide
markedly reduced the increase in PGE2 levels in the ischaemic cerebral cortex
24 h after stroke and diminished infarct size by 48% with respect to
vehicle-treated animals after 3 days of reperfusion. Furthermore, nimesulide
significantly attenuated the blood-brain barrier (BBB) damage and leukocyte
infiltration (as measured by EB leakage and MPO activity, respectively) seen at
48 h after the initial ischaemic episode. These studies provide the first
experimental evidence that COX-2 inhibition with nimesulide is able to limit
BBB disruption and leukocyte infiltration following transient focal cerebral
ischaemia. Neuroprotection afforded by nimesulide is observed even when the
treatment is delayed until 6 h after the onset of ischaemia, confirming a wide
therapeutic window of COX-2 inhibitors in experimental stroke. On the contrary,
selective inhibition of COX-1 with VAS had no significant effect on the
evaluated parameters. These data suggest that COX-2 activity, but not COX-1
activity, contributes to the progression of focal ischaemic brain injury, and
that the beneficial effects observed with non-selective COX inhibitors are
probably associated to COX-2 rather than to COX-1 inhibition.
"
What are the fundamental groups of smooth loci of Log del Pezzo Surfaces?,"  It is known that the fundamental groups of smooth loci of Log del Pezzo
Surfaces are finite groups. The aim of this note is to study these finite
groups. A short table containing these groups is given. And lots of groups on
the table are proved to be fundamental groups.
"
What are the two approaches to Type IIA toroidal orientifolds?,"  Type IIA toroidal orientifolds offer a promising toolkit for model builders,
especially when one includes not only the usual fluxes from NS-NS and R-R field
strengths, but also fluxes that are T-dual to the NS-NS three-form flux. These
new ingredients are known as metric fluxes and non-geometric fluxes, and can
help stabilize moduli or can lead to other new features. In this paper we study
two approaches to these constructions, by effective field theory or by toroidal
fibers twisted over a toroidal base. Each approach leads us to important
observations, in particular the presence of D-terms in the four-dimensional
effective potential in some cases, and a more subtle treatment of the
quantization of the general NS-NS fluxes. Though our methods are general, we
illustrate each approach on the example of an orientifold of T^6/Z_4.
"
What is the quasi-hamiltonian analogue of the O'Shea-Sjamaar convexity theorem?,"  The main result of this paper is a quasi-hamiltonian analogue of a special
case of the O'Shea-Sjamaar convexity theorem for usual momentum maps. We denote
by U a simply connected compact connected Lie group and we fix an involutive
automorphism of maximal rank on this Lie group (such an automorphism always
exists). We then denote by M a quasi-hamiltonian U-space and we prove that the
image under the momentum map of the fixed-point set of a form-reversing
compatible involution of M is a convex polytope, which is in fact equal to the
full momentum polytope. This theorem was announced in arXiv:math/0609517v1. As
an application, we obtain an example of lagrangian subspace in representation
spaces of surface groups.
"
,"  Conductance histograms of work-hardened Al show a series up to 11 equidistant
peaks with a period of 1.15 +/- 0.02 of the quantum conductance unit G_0 =
2e^2/h. Assuming the peaks originate from atomic discreteness, this agrees with
the value of 1.16 G_0 per atom obtained in numerical calculations by Hasmy et
al.
"
What are the conditions of optimization in terms of function of set?,"  The variant of calculation of functions of set and their application is
offered. In particular: the new measure of system of sets generalizing
classical concept of a measure is entered; the variation of set that has
allowed to construct a derivative of function of set on a measure is entered,
and to receive necessary conditions of optimization in terms of function of
set.
"
What are the different density regions observed in the system and how do they relate to the formation of a four-coordinated network of bonds?,"  We introduce a simple spherical model whose structural properties are similar
to the ones generated by models with directional interactions, by employing a
binary mixture of large and small hard spheres, with a square-well attraction
acting only between particles of different size. The small particles provide
the bonds between the large ones. With a proper choice of the interaction
parameters, as well as of the relative concentration of the two species, it is
possible to control the effective valence. Here we focus on a specific choice
of the parameters which favors tetrahedral ordering and study the equilibrium
static properties of the system in a large window of densities and
temperatures. Upon lowering the temperature we observe a progressive increase
in local order, accompanied by the formation of a four-coordinated network of
bonds. Three different density regions are observed: at low density the system
phase separates into a gas and a liquid phase; at intermediate densities a
network of fully bonded particles develops; at high densities -- due to the
competition between excluded volume and attractive interactions -- the system
forms a defective network. The very same behavior has been previously observed
in numerical studies of non-spherical models for molecular liquids, such as
water, and in models of patchy colloidal particles. Differently from these
models, theoretical treatments devised for spherical potentials, e.g. integral
equations and ideal mode coupling theory for the glass transition can be
applied in the present case, opening the way for a deeper understanding of the
thermodynamic and dynamic behavior of low valence molecules and particles.
"
How can a nonzero spin current be generated through a Kondo impurity in the presence of a finite magnetic field?,"  Transport properties of ultrasmall quantum dots with a single unpaired
electron are commonly modeled by the nonequilibrium Kondo model, describing the
exchange interaction of a spin-1/2 local moment with two leads of
noninteracting electrons. Remarkably, the model possesses an exact solution
when tuned to a special manifold in its parameter space known as the Toulouse
limit. We use the Toulouse limit to exactly calculate the adiabatically pumped
spin current in the Kondo regime. In the absence of both potential scattering
and a voltage bias, the instantaneous charge current is strictly zero for a
generic Kondo model. However, a nonzero spin current can be pumped through the
system in the presence of a finite magnetic field, provided the spin couples
asymmetrically to the two leads. Tunneling through a Kondo impurity thus offers
a natural mechanism for generating a pure spin current. We show, in particular,
that one can devise pumping cycles along which the average spin pumped per
cycle is closely equal to $\hbar$. By analogy with Brouwer's formula for
noninteracting systems with two driven parameters, the pumped spin current is
expressed as a geometrical property of a scattering matrix. However, the
relevant %Alex: I replaced topological with geometrical in the sentence above
scattering matrix that enters the formulation pertains to the Majorana fermions
that appear at the Toulouse limit rather than the physical electrons that carry
the current. These results are obtained by combining the nonequilibrium Keldysh
Green function technique with a systematic gradient expansion, explicitly
exposing the small parameter controlling the adiabatic limit.
"
What is the distribution of the topological charge in the SU(3) Yang-Mills theory?,"  We present preliminary results for a high statistics study of the topological
charge distribution in the SU(3) Yang-Mills theory obtained by using the
definition of the charge suggested by Neuberger fermions. We find statistical
evidence for deviations from a gaussian distribution. The large statistics
required has been obtained by using PCs of the INFN-GRID.
"
What are the properties of a T_1-topology?,"  Let X be a topological space. The closure of \Delta = {(x, x) : x \in X} in X
\times X is a symmetric relation on X. We characterise those equivalence
relations on an infinite set that arise as the closure of the diagonal with
respect to a T_1-topology.
"
What is the relationship between the independent Planck mass and Planck length?,"  Quantum relativity as a generalized, or rather deformed, version of Einstein
relativity with a linear realization on a classical six-geometry beyond the
familiar setting of space-time offer a new framework to think about the quantum
space-time structure. The formulation requires two deformations to be
implemented through imposing two fundamental invariants. We take them to be the
independent Planck mass and Planck length. Together, they gives the quantum
$\hbar$. The scheme leads to {\small \boldmath\protect SO(2,4)} as the
relativity symmetry. The quantum world has an AdS$_5$ `classical' geometry,
which is parallel to the ""conformal universe"", but not scale invariant.
"
What is the relationship between galaxy populations in rich superclusters and their density?,"  We study the morphology of galaxy populations of the richest superclusters
from the catalogue of superclusters of galaxies in the 2dF Galaxy Redshift
Survey using the luminosity density distribution and Minkowski functional V3.
We compare the properties of grouped and isolated galaxies in regions of
different density in superclusters. We find that in high-density cores of rich
superclusters there is an excess of early type, passive galaxies, among
galaxies in groups and clusters, as well as among those which do not belong to
groups, while in lower density outer regions there are more blue, star-forming
galaxies both in groups and among those galaxies which do not belong to groups.
This also shows that the galaxy content of groups depends on the environment
where the groups reside in. The density distributions and the behaviour of the
Minkowski functional V3 for different superclusters show that substructures in
superclusters as traced by different populations of galaxies are very
different. Our results show that both local (group/cluster) and global
(supercluster) environments are important in forming galaxy morphologies and
star formation activity. The presence of a high density core with X-ray
clusters and a relatively small fraction of star-forming galaxies in the
supercluster SCL126 may be an indication that this supercluster has started its
evolution earlier than the supercluster SCL9.

"What are the constraints on the interaction of unparticle sector with nucleons, neutrinos, electrons and muons?","  The existence of an unparticle sector, weakly coupled to the standard model,
would have a profound impact on supernova (SN) physics. Emission of energy into
the unparticle sector from the core of SN1987A would have significantly
shortened the observed neutrino burst. The unparticle interaction with
nucleons, neutrinos, electrons and muons is constrained to be so weak that it
is unlikely to provide any missing-energy signature at colliders. One important
exception are models where scale invariance in the hidden sector is broken by
the Higgs vacuum expectation value. In this case the SN emission is suppressed
by threshold effects.
"
What is the Lifshitz-Slyozov-Wagner equation used to describe the homogenization limit of a Stefan problem?,"  We rigorously derive a weak form of the Lifshitz-Slyozov-Wagner equation as
the homogenization limit of a Stefan-type problem describing
reaction-controlled coarsening of a large number of small spherical particles.
Moreover, we deduce that the effective mean-field description holds true in the
particular limit of vanishing surface-area density of particles.
"
What is the limiting absorption principle in the case of a large gradient perturbation?,"  In this paper we consider magnetic Schr\""odinger operators in R^n, n \ge 3.
Under almost optimal conditions on the potentials in terms of decay and
regularity we prove smoothing and Strichartz estimates, as well as a limiting
absorption principle. For large gradient perturbations the latter is not a
corollary of the free case as the differentiated free resolvent does not have
small operator norm on any weighted L^2 spaces.
  We instead show that the spectral radius of such operators decreases to zero,
hence their perturbation of the identity is still invertible. The key estimates
are based on an angular decomposition of the free resolvent, or rather a bound
that holds uniformly for all possible angular decompositions. The proof avoids
the Fourier transform and instead uses H\""ormander's variable coefficient
Plancherel theorem for oscillatory integrals.
"
What is the Fermi-liquid collective mode contribution to the transmission of electromagnetic waves through a thin film of a clean metal in the presence of a strong external magnetic field?,"  In the present work we theoretically analyze the contribution from a
transverse Fermi-liquid collective mode to the transmission of electromagnetic
waves through a thin film of a clean metal in the presence of a strong external
magnetic field. We show that at the appropriate Fermi surface geometry the
transverse Fermi-liquid wave may appear in conduction electrons liquid at
frequencies $\omega$ significantly smaller than the cyclotron frequency of
charge carriers $\Omega$ provided that the mean collision frequency $\tau^{-1}$
is smaller than $\omega.$ Also, we show that in realistic metals size
oscillations in the transmission coefficient associated with the Firmi-liquid
mode may be observable in experiments. Under certain conditions these
oscillations may predominate over the remaining size effects in the
transmission coefficient.
"
What is the stability of the two HCOOH stabilized lasers?,"  We report on higly accurate absolute frequency measurement against a
femtosecond frequency comb of 6 saturated absorption lines of formic acid
(HCOOH) with an accuracy of 1 kHz. We also report the frequency measurement of
17 other lines with an accuracy of 2 kHz. Those lines are in quasi coincidence
with the 9R(36) to 9R(42) CO$_2$ laser emission lines and are probed either by
a CO$_2$ or a widely tunable quantum cascade laser phase locked to a master
CO$_2$ laser. The relative stability of two HCOOH stabilized lasers is
characterized by a relative Allan deviation of 4.5 10$^{-12}$ $\tau^{-1/2}$.
They give suitable frequency references for H$_2^+$ Doppler free two-photon
spectroscopy.

"What is the comparison between the X-ray-to-optical flux ratios of absorbed active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in the Chandra Deep Field North (CDF-N) and those of nearby, optically classified Seyfert 2 galaxies?","  We have compared the X-ray--to--optical flux ratios (F_x/F_opt) of absorbed
active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in the Chandra Deep Field North (CDF-N) with
those of nearby, optically classified Seyfert 2 galaxies. The comparison
provides an opportunity to explore the extent to which the local population of
absorbed AGNs can account for the properties of the distant, spectroscopically
ambiguous sources that produce the hard X-ray background. Our nearby sample
consists of 38 objects that well represent the local Seyfert 2 luminosity
function. Integrated UBVRI photometry and broadband X-ray observations are
presented. Using these data, we have simulated the F_x/F_opt ratios that local
Seyfert 2s would exhibit if they were observed in the redshift range 0.2 < z <
1.3 as part of the CDF-N. In the simulations we account for the effects of
redshift on flux measurements in fixed observed-frame bands, and the way the
luminosity function of a given population is sampled in a flux-limited survey
like the CDF-N. Overall, we find excellent agreement between our simulations
and the observed distribution of F_x/F_opt ratios for absorbed AGNs in the
CDF-N. Our analysis has thus failed to reveal any physical differences between
the local population of Seyfert 2s and CDF-N sources with similar X-ray
properties. These results support the hypothesis that the nuclear emission
lines of many distant hard X-ray galaxies are hidden in ground-based spectra
due to a combination of observational effects: signal-to-noise ratio,
wavelength coverage, and dilution by host-galaxy light.
"
What is the role of the loop-induced s→d U transition in the HyperCP data?,"  We show that the very light spin-1 gauge U-boson of the extra $U(1)'$ gauge
model in the framework of the supersymmetric standard model extension can be a
good candidate of the new light particle suggested by the HyperCP experiment.
We demonstrate that the flavor changing neutral currents (FCNCs) for the
HyperCP events in the decay of $\Sigma^{+}\to p \mu^{+} \mu^{-}$ can be
generated at both tree and loop levels. In particular, we find that the loop
induced $s\to d U$ transition due to the tensor-type interaction with the
dimension-5 electric dipole operator plays a very important role on the FCNCs.
Our explanation of the HyperCP data with the spin-1 U-boson is different from
that based on a light pseudoscalar Higgs boson or sgoldstino in the literature.
In particular, the U-boson involves a rich phenomenology in particle physics as
well as cosmology.
"
Can we establish necessary optimality conditions for variational problems on time scales?,"  We study more general variational problems on time scales. Previous results
are generalized by proving necessary optimality conditions for (i) variational
problems involving delta derivatives of more than the first order, and (ii)
problems of the calculus of variations with delta-differential side conditions
(Lagrange problem of the calculus of variations on time scales).
"
What is the Hamiltonian formalism used to analyze the glueball spectrum of pure Yang-Mills theory in 2+1 dimensions?,"  We review our recent work on the glueball spectrum of pure Yang-Mills theory
in 2+1 dimensions. The calculations make use of Karabali-Nair corner variables
in the Hamiltonian formalism, and involve a determination of the leading form
of the ground-state wavefunctional.

"What are the physical parameters of the B star V2104Cyg, and what is its place among the variable B stars on the upper Main Sequence?","  We obtained the first long, homogenous time-series of V2104Cyg, consisting of
679 datapoints, with the uvbybeta photometers of Sierra Nevada and San Pedro
Martir Observatories with the aim to detect and subsequently interpret the
intrinsic frequencies of this previously unstudied variable star, which turned
out to be a Be star. We try to figure out its place among the variable B stars
on the upper Main Sequence. In order to obtain additional information on
physical parameters we collected a few spectra with the ELODIE and FIES
instruments. We searched for frequencies in the uvby passbands using 2
different frequency analysis methods and used the S/N>4 criterion to select the
significant periodicities. We obtained an estimate of the physical parameters
of the underlying B star of spectral type between B5 and B7, by correcting for
the presence of a circumstellar disk, using a formalism based on the strenght
of the Halpha line emission. We detected 3 independent frequencies with
amplitudes below 0.01mag, f1 = 4.7126 c/d, f2 = 2.2342 c/d and f3 = 4.671 c/d,
and discovered that V2104Cyg is a Be star. The fast rotation (vsini=290+/-10
km/s, and 27<i<45) hampered the investigation of the associated pulsational
parameters l. Nevertheless, the most plausible explanation for the observed
variability of this mid-late type Be star is a non-radial pulsation model. This
paper is based on observations obtained at the Observatorio Astronomico
Nacional San Pedro Martir (Mexico), Observatorio de Sierra Nevada (Spain),
Observatoire de Haute Provence (France), and on observations made with the
Nordic Optical Telescope, Observatorio Roque de los Muchachos, La Palma, Spain.
"
How do the phase differences between the UV and EUV passbands change with increasing temporal frequency in mossy and non-mossy active-region plage?,"  We study the dynamical interaction of the solar chromosphere with the
transition region in mossy and non-mossy active-region plage. We carefully
align image sequences taken with the Transition Region And Coronal Explorer
(TRACE) in the ultraviolet passbands around 1550, 1600, and 1700 A and the
extreme ultraviolet passbands at 171 and 195 A. We compute Fourier
phase-difference spectra that are spatially averaged separately over mossy and
non-mossy plage to study temporal modulations as a function of temporal
frequency. The 1550 versus 171 A comparison shows zero phase difference in
non-mossy plage. In mossy plage, the phase differences between all UV and EUV
passbands show pronounced upward trends with increasing frequency, which
abruptly changes into zero phase difference beyond 4-6 mHz. The phase
difference between the 171 and 195 A sequences exhibits a shallow dip below 3
mHz and then also turns to zero phase difference beyond this value. We
attribute the various similarities between the UV and EUV diagnostics that are
evident in the phase-difference diagrams to the contribution of the C IV
resonance lines in the 1550 and 1600 A passbands. The strong upward trend at
the lower frequencies indicates the presence of upward-traveling disturbances.
It points to correspondence between the lower chromosphere and the upper
transition region, perhaps by slow-mode magnetosonic disturbances, or by a
connection between chromospheric and coronal heating mechanisms. The transition
from this upward trend to zero phase difference at higher frequencies is due to
the intermittent obscuration by fibrils that occult the foot points of hot
loops, which are bright in the EUV and C IV lines, in oscillatory manner.
"
What are the main characteristics of anticipated backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs)?,"  In this paper we discuss new types of differential equations which we call
anticipated backward stochastic differential equations (anticipated BSDEs). In
these equations the generator includes not only the values of solutions of the
present but also the future. We show that these anticipated BSDEs have unique
solutions, a comparison theorem for their solutions, and a duality between them
and stochastic differential delay equations.
"
What is the effective worldvolume description of N coincident M2-branes ending on an M5-brane in M-theory?,"  The dissertation consists of two parts. The first presents an account of the
effective worldvolume description of $N$ coincident M2-branes ending on an
M5-brane in M-theory. It reviews Basu and Harvey's recent description of the
worldvolume theory of the M2-branes in terms of a Bogomol'nyi equation, and its
solution via a fuzzy (three-) funnel. Tests of the consistency of this picture
are then performed and many of the issues with it are addressed. This is
followed by a discussion of how a refinement of the fuzzy three-sphere algebra
used can lead to the correct $N^{3/2}$ scaling of degrees of freedom for this
system. A reduction of this Basu-Harvey picture to the D1-string picture of the
D1-D3 intersection is then performed via constructing a reduction of the
fuzzy-three sphere to the fuzzy two-sphere.
  The second part of the dissertation describes how a holomorphic factorisation
argument can be used to demonstrate quantum equivalence of the doubled
formalism of string theory with the standard formalism by deriving the
partition function, including instanton and oscillator sectors.
"
What are the key concepts in the deterministic model for genetic hitch-hiking?,"  We suggest a simple deterministic approximation for the growth of the
favoured-allele frequency during a selective sweep. Using this approximation we
introduce an accurate model for genetic hitch-hiking. Only when Ns < 10 (N is
the population size and s denotes the selection coefficient), are discrepancies
between our approximation and direct numerical simulations of a Moran model
noticeable. Our model describes the gene genealogies of a contiguous segment of
neutral loci close to the selected one, and it does not assume that the
selective sweep happens instantaneously. This enables us to compute SNP
distributions on the neutral segment without bias.
"
What is the Large Hadron Collider's role in the Large Hadron Collider phenomena?,"  If quarks are composite particles, then excited states are expected to play a
r\^ole in the Large Hadron Collider phenomena. Concentrating on virtual
effects, and using a large part of the CMS detection criteria, we present here
a realistic examination of their effect in diphoton production at the LHC. For
various luminosities, we present the 99 % confidence limit (CL) achievable in
$\Lambda-M_{q*}$ parameter space where $\Lambda$ is the compositeness scale and
M_{q^*} the mass of the state. For a q^* of mass 0.5 TeV, $\Lambda \leq 1.55
(2.95)$ can be excluded at 99% CL with 30 (200)${\rm fb}^{-1}$ integrated
luminosity.
"
What are the advantages of a far-IR interferometer in the 25 - 400 micron wavelength range?,"  By providing sensitive sub-arcsecond images and integral field spectroscopy
in the 25 - 400 micron wavelength range, a far-IR interferometer will
revolutionize our understanding of planetary system formation, reveal
otherwise-undetectable planets through the disk perturbations they induce, and
spectroscopically probe the atmospheres of extrasolar giant planets in orbits
typical of most of the planets in our solar system. The technical challenges
associated with interferometry in the far-IR are greatly relaxed relative to
those encountered at shorter wavelengths or when starlight nulling is required.
A structurally connected far-IR interferometer with a maximum baseline length
of 36 m can resolve the interesting spatial structures in nascent and developed
exoplanetary systems and measure exozodiacal emission at a sensitivity level
critical to TPF-I mission planning. The Space Infrared Interferometric
Telescope was recommended in the Community Plan for Far-IR/Submillimeter Space
Astronomy, studied as a Probe-class mission, and estimated to cost 800M
dollars. The scientific communities in Europe, Japan, and Canada have also
demonstrated a keen interest in far-IR interferometry through mission planning
workshops and technology research, suggesting the possibility of an
international collaborative effort.
"
What are the eigenfunctions of the singularly perturbed second order elliptic system in the whole space?,"  We consider singularly perturbed second order elliptic system in the whole
space with fast oscillating coefficients. We construct the complete asymptotic
expansions for the eigenvalues converging to the isolated ones of the
homogenized system, as well as the complete asymptotic expansions for the
associated eigenfunctions.
"
What are the bounds for the Mertens' theorem for the full G-shift of a finitely-generated torsion-free nilpotent group G?,"  We study the asymptotic behaviour of the orbit-counting function and a
dynamical Mertens' theorem for the full $G$-shift for a finitely-generated
torsion-free nilpotent group $G$. Using bounds for the M{\""o}bius function on
the lattice of subgroups of finite index and known subgroup growth estimates,
we find a single asymptotic of the shape \[ \sum_{|\tau|\le
N}\frac{1}{e^{h|\tau|}}\sim CN^{\alpha}(\log N)^{\beta} \] where $|\tau|$ is
the cardinality of the finite orbit $\tau$. For the usual orbit-counting
function we find upper and lower bounds together with numerical evidence to
suggest that for actions of non-cyclic groups there is no single asymptotic in
terms of elementary functions.
"
What are the conditions for the existence of an extension of a (pro)monoidal category structure along a given dense functor to a cocomplete category?,"  We give a summary (without proofs) of the main results in the author's thesis
entitled ``Construction of biclosed categories'' (University of New South
Wales, Australia, 1970). This summary is reprinted directly from Report 81-0030
of the School of Mathematics and Physics, Macquarie University, April 1981. In
particular, it gives sufficient conditions for existence of an extension of a
(pro)monoidal category structure along a given dense functor to a cocomplete
category. The two basic procedures used in the proof turn out to be special
cases of the final result, the two respective dense functors then being the
Yoneda embedding followed by a localisation. The final result has a standard
universal property based on left Kan extension of (pro)monoidal functors along
the given dense functor, however this property is not stated explicitly here.
"
What are the embedding theorems related to the Cartan-Kahler theory?,"  Using the Cartan-Kahler theory, and results on real algebraic structures, we
prove two embedding theorems. First, the interior of a smooth, compact
3-manifold may be isometrically embedded into a G_2-manifold as an associative
submanifold. Second, the interior of a smooth, compact 4-manifold K, whose
double has a trivial bundle of self-dual 2-forms, may be isometrically embedded
into a Spin(7)-manifold as a Cayley submanifold. Along the way, we also show
that Bochner's Theorem on real analytic approximation of smooth differential
forms, can be obtained using real algebraic tools developed by Akbulut and
King.
"
What are the quantum dynamics of an electron in the singly ionized double-donor structure in a semiconductor under the influence of laser pulses?,"  We study theoretically the quantum dynamics of an electron in the
singlyionized double-donor structure in the semiconductor host under the
influence of laser pulses whose frequencies are close to structure resonant
frequencies. This system can be used as a charge qubit where the logical states
are defined by the lowest two energy states of the remaining valence electron
localized around one or another donor. The quantum operations are performed via
resonant or Raman-like transitions between the localized (qubit) states and the
excited states delocalized over the structure, combined with phase shifts
between qubit states generated by voltage pulses. The possibility of
realization of arbitrary single-qubit rotations is demonstrated.
"
What is the relationship between the observed source sizes and the linear resolution in the survey?,"  We have undertaken an unprecedentedly large 1.1 millimeter continuum survey
of three nearby star forming clouds using Bolocam at the Caltech Submillimeter
Observatory. We mapped the largest areas in each cloud at millimeter or
submillimeter wavelengths to date: 7.5 sq. deg in Perseus (Paper I), 10.8 sq.
deg in Ophiuchus (Paper II), and 1.5 sq. deg in Serpens with a resolution of
31"", detecting 122, 44, and 35 cores, respectively. Here we report on results
of the Serpens survey and compare the three clouds. Average measured angular
core sizes and their dependence on resolution suggest that many of the observed
sources are consistent with power-law density profiles. Tests of the effects of
cloud distance reveal that linear resolution strongly affects measured source
sizes and densities, but not the shape of the mass distribution. Core mass
distribution slopes in Perseus and Ophiuchus (alpha=2.1+/-0.1 and
alpha=2.1+/-0.3) are consistent with recent measurements of the stellar IMF,
whereas the Serpens distribution is flatter (alpha=1.6+/-0.2). We also compare
the relative mass distribution shapes to predictions from turbulent
fragmentation simulations. Dense cores constitute less than 10% of the total
cloud mass in all three clouds, consistent with other measurements of low
star-formation efficiencies. Furthermore, most cores are found at high column
densities; more than 75% of 1.1 mm cores are associated with Av>8 mag in
Perseus, 15 mag in Serpens, and 20-23 mag in Ophiuchus.
"
What is the average transverse momentum of hadrons produced in high energy collisions used as a diagnostic probe of high density physics?,"  Average transverse momentum of hadrons produced in high energy collisions is
proposed as a diagnostic probe of high density (saturation) physics. We show
that by introducing and varying a transverse momentum cutoff in the definition
of the average transverse momentum, one can eliminate the uncertainty in the
overall magnitude of the leading order hadron production cross section in high
energy collisions, and semi-quantitatively map the different dynamical regions
predicted by the saturation physics. We discuss the applications of this method
to pion production at RHIC and LHC and make quantitative predictions for the
average transverse momentum of produced pions in the kinematics appropriate for
the RHIC and LHC experiments.
"
What is the concept of massive N=1 supermultiplets in flat d=4 Minkowski space-time?,"  In this paper we give explicit construction of massive N=1 supermultiplets in
flat d=4 Minkowski space-time. We work in a component on-shell formalism based
on gauge invariant description of massive integer and half-integer spin
particles where massive supermultiplets are constructed out of appropriate set
of massless ones.
"
What is the influence of gluon evolution on the production of prompt photons at the LHC?,"  In this paper we estimate the influence of nonlinear gluon evolution in the
production of prompt photons at the LHC pp collider. We assume the validity of
collinear factorization and consider the EHKQS parton distributions, which are
solutions of the GLR-MQ evolution equations and describe quite well the DESY
$ep$ HERA data, as input in our calculations. We find that both single and
double photon production are enhanced for low-$p_T$ photons and central
rapidities, while this effect is absent for the high-$p_T$ photons. The
implications of this effect for the Quark-Gluon Plasma searches and for the QCD
background to Higgs are also discussed.
"
How is the critical temperature calculated using numerical methods?,"  In this paper we develop an analytic expression for the critical temperature
for a gas of ideal bosons in a combined harmonic lattice potential, relevant to
current experiments using optical lattices. We give corrections to the critical
temperature arising from effective mass modifications of the low energy
spectrum, finite size effects and excited band states. We compute the critical
temperature using numerical methods and compare to our analytic result. We
study condensation in an optical lattice over a wide parameter regime and
demonstrate that the critical temperature can be increased or reduced relative
to the purely harmonic case by adjusting the harmonic trap frequency. We show
that a simple numerical procedure based on a piecewise analytic density of
states provides an accurate prediction for the critical temperature.
"
What are the implications of the SiO emission in the core of the giant molecular cloud G333.125-0.562?,"  We report the detection of the SiO (J = 2 - 1) transition from the massive
cold dense core G333.125-0.562. The core remains undetected at wavelengths
shorter than 70 micron and has compact 1.2 mm dust continuum. The SiO emission
is localised to the core. The observations are part of a continuing
multi-molecular line survey of the giant molecular cloud G333. Other detected
molecules in the core include 13CO, C18O, CS, HCO+, HCN, HNC, CH3OH, N2H+, SO,
HC3N, NH3, and some of their isotopes. In addition, from NH3 (1,1) and (2,2)
inversion lines, we obtain a temperature of 13 K. From fitting to the spectral
energy distribution we obtain a colour temperature of 18 K and a gas mass of 2
x 10^3 solar mass. We have also detected a 22 GHz water maser in the core,
together with methanol maser emission, suggesting the core will host massive
star formation. We hypothesise that the SiO emission arises from shocks
associated with an outflow in the cold core.

What are the degrees of freedom of an atom and their relation to the LC circuit and a qubit in the Sisyphus cooling setup?,"  Laser cooling of the atomic motion paved the way for remarkable achievements
in the fields of quantum optics and atomic physics, including Bose-Einstein
condensation and the trapping of atoms in optical lattices. More recently
superconducting qubits were shown to act as artificial two-level atoms,
displaying Rabi oscillations, Ramsey fringes, and further quantum effects.
Coupling such qubits to resonators brought the superconducting circuits into
the realm of quantum electrodynamics (circuit QED). It opened the perspective
to use superconducting qubits as micro-coolers or to create a population
inversion in the qubit to induce lasing behavior of the resonator. Furthering
these analogies between quantum optical and superconducting systems we
demonstrate here Sisyphus cooling of a low frequency LC oscillator coupled to a
near-resonantly driven superconducting qubit. In the quantum optics setup the
mechanical degrees of freedom of an atom are cooled by laser driving the atom's
electronic degrees of freedom. Here the roles of the two degrees of freedom are
played by the LC circuit and the qubit's levels, respectively. We also
demonstrate the counterpart of the Sisyphus cooling, namely Sisyphus
amplification. Parallel to the experimental demonstration we analyze the system
theoretically and find quantitative agreement, which supports the
interpretation and allows us to estimate system parameters.
"
What are the refined selection criteria used to identify isolated galaxies and their satellites in the SDSS?,"  We identify satellites of isolated galaxies in SDSS and examine their angular
distribution. Using mock catalogues generated from cosmological N-body
simulations, we demonstrate that the selection criteria used to select isolated
galaxies and their satellites must be very strict in order to correctly
identify systems in which the primary galaxy dominates its environment. The
criteria used in many previous studies instead select predominantly group
members. We refine a set of selection criteria for which the group
contamination is estimated to be less than 7% and present a catalogue of the
resulting sample. The angular distribution of satellites about their host is
biased towards the major axes for spheroidal galaxies and probably also for red
disc galaxies, but is isotropic for blue disc galaxies, i.e. it is the colour
of the host that determines the distribution of its satellites rather than its
morphology. The similar anisotropy measured in this study as in studies that
were dominated by groups implies that group-specific processes are not
responsible for the angular distribution. Satellites that are most likely to
have been recently accreted show a tendancy to lie along the same axis as the
surrounding large scale structure. The orientations of isolated early and
intermediate-type galaxies also align with the surrounding large scale
structures. We discuss the origin of the anisotropic satellite distribution and
consider the implications of our results, critically assessing the respective
roles played by the orientation of the visible galaxy within its dark matter
halo; anisotropic accretion of satellites from the larger scale environment;
and the biased nature of satellites as tracers of the underlying dark matter
subhalo population. (Abridged)

What are the key concepts in the concordance model of cosmology?,"  This is a written version of a series of lectures aimed at undergraduate
students in astrophysics/particle theory/particle experiment. We summarize the
important progress made in recent years towards understanding high energy
astrophysical processes and we survey the state of the art regarding the
concordance model of cosmology.
"
What are the magnetic fields estimated from pure synchrotron self-Compton models in agreement with the magnetic fields extrapolated to the blazar emission region?,"  The magnetic field in an accretion disk is estimated assuming that all of the
angular momentum within prescribed accretion disk radii is removed by a jet.
The magnetic field estimated at the base of the jet is extrapolated to the
blazar emission region using a model for a relativistic axisymmetric jet
combined with some simplifying assumptions based on the relativistic nature of
the flow. The extrapolated magnetic field is compared with estimates based upon
the synchrotron and inverse Compton emission from three blazars, MKN 501, MKN
421 and PKS 2155-304. The magnetic fields evaluated from pure synchrotron self-
Compton models are inconsistent with the magnetic fields extrapolated in this
way. However, in two cases inverse Compton models in which a substantial part
of the soft photon field is generated locally agree well, mainly because these
models imply magnetic field strengths which are closer to being consistent with
Poynting flux dominated jets. This comparison is based on estimating the mass
accretion rate from the jet energy flux. Further comparisons along these lines
will be facilitated by independent estimates of the mass accretion rate in
blazars and by more detailed models for jet propagation near the black hole.

"What is the most likely explanation for the velocity patterns in the central region of M33, and what implications does this have for the shape of M33's inner dark matter halo profile?","  We present measurements of the stellar and gaseous velocities in the central
5' of the Local Group spiral M33. The data were obtained with the ARC 3.5m
telescope. Blue and red spectra with resolutions from 2 to 4\AA covering the
principal gaseous emission and stellar absorption lines were obtained along the
major and minor axes and six other position angles. The observed radial
velocities of the ionized gas along the photometric major axis of M33 remain
flat at ~22 km s^{-1} all the way into the center, while the stellar velocities
show a gradual rise from zero to 22 km s^{-1} over that same region. The
central star cluster is at or very close to the dynamical center, with a
velocity that is in accordance with M33's systemic velocity to within our
uncertainties. Velocities on the minor axis are non-zero out to about 1' from
the center in both the stars and gas. Together with the major axis velocities,
they point at significant deviations from circular rotation. The most likely
explanation for the bulk of the velocity patterns are streaming motions along a
weak inner bar with a PA close to that of the minor axis, as suggested by
previously published IR photometric images. The presence of bar imprints in M33
implies that all major Local Group galaxies are barred. The non-circular
motions over the inner 200 pc make it difficult to constrain the shape of M33's
inner dark matter halo profile. If the non-circular motions we find in this
nearby Sc galaxy are present in other more distant late-type galaxies, they
might be difficult to recognize.
"
What is the deformation procedure used to modify the Lagrangian action?,"  Consistent interactions that can be added to a free, Abelian gauge theory
comprising a collection of BF models and a set of three-form gauge fields are
constructed from the deformation of the solution to the master equation based
on specific cohomological techniques. Under the hypotheses of smooth, local, PT
invariant, Lorentz covariant, and Poincare invariant interactions, supplemented
with the requirement on the preservation of the number of derivatives on each
field with respect to the free theory, we obtain that the deformation procedure
modifies the Lagrangian action, the gauge transformations as well as the
accompanying algebra.
"
What is the relationship between the quasi-Yetter-Drinfeld module and the Weyl algebra?,"  Braided doubles provide a unifying framework for classical and quantum
universal enveloping algebras and rational Cherednik algebras. They are a class
of algebras with triangular decomposition, arising from a deformation problem,
the solutions to which are called quasi-Yetter-Drinfeld modules. A basic family
of quasi-YD modules is provided by braidings (matrices satisfying the quantum
Yang-Baxter equation); these give rise to quantum versions of the Weyl algebra,
where the role of polynomial rings is played by Nichols-Woronowicz algebras.
Rational Cherednik algebras for t = 0 emerge as subalgebras in doubles of
Nichols-Woronowicz algebras. For nonzero t, the Nichols-Woronowicz algebra is
replaced with an algebra associated to the classical Yang-Baxter equation.
"
What is the effect of sectional curvature on the stability of geodesic flows in Riemannian thin tubes?,"  Ricci and sectional curvatures of twisted flux tubes in Riemannian manifold
are computed to investigate the stability of the tubes. The geodesic equations
are used to show that in the case of thick tubes, the curvature of planar
(Frenet torsion-free) tubes have the effect ct of damping the flow speed along
the tube. Stability of geodesic flows in the Riemannian twisted thin tubes
(almost filaments), against constant radial perturbations is investigated by
using the method of negative sectional curvature for unstable flows. No special
form of the flow like Beltrami flows is admitted, and the proof is general for
the case of thin tubes. It is found that for positive perturbations and angular
speed of the flow, instability is achieved, since the sectional Ricci curvature
of the twisted tube metric is negative.
"
What is the relationship between the bosonic Thirring model and the bosonic chiral Gross-Neveu model?,"  We study the question of diagonalizability of the Hamiltonian for the
Faddeev-Reshetikhin (FR) model in the two particle sector. Although the two
particle S-matrix element for the FR model, which may be relevant for the
quantization of strings on $AdS_{5}\times S^{5}$, has been calculated recently
using field theoretic methods, we find that the Hamiltonian for the system in
this sector is not diagonalizable. We trace the difficulty to the fact that the
interaction term in the Hamiltonian violating Lorentz invariance leads to
discontinuity conditions (matching conditions) that cannot be satisfied. We
determine the most general quartic interaction Hamiltonian that can be
diagonalized. This includes the bosonic Thirring model as well as the bosonic
chiral Gross-Neveu model which we find share the same S-matrix. We explain this
by showing, through a Fierz transformation, that these two models are in fact
equivalent. In addition, we find a general quartic interaction Hamiltonian,
violating Lorentz invariance, that can be diagonalized with the same two
particle S-matrix element as calculated by Klose and Zarembo for the FR model.
This family of generalized interaction Hamiltonians is not Hermitian, but is
$PT$ symmetric. We show that the wave functions for this system are also $PT$
symmetric. Thus, the theory is in a $PT$ unbroken phase which guarantees the
reality of the energy spectrum as well as the unitarity of the S-matrix.
"
What is the ratio of the effective viscosity coefficient to the turbulent diffusion coefficient in protoplanetary disks?,"  The process of turbulent radial mixing in protoplanetary disks has strong
relevance to the analysis of the spatial distribution of crystalline dust
species in disks around young stars and to studies of the composition of
meteorites and comets in our own solar system.
  A debate has gone on in the recent literature on the ratio of the effective
viscosity coefficient $\nu$ (responsible for accretion) to the turbulent
diffusion coefficient $D$ (responsible for mixing). Numerical
magneto-hydrodynamic simulations have yielded values between $\nu/D\simeq 10$
(Carballido, Stone & Pringle, 2005) and $\nu/D\simeq 0.85$ (Johansen & Klahr,
2005}). Here we present two analytic arguments for the ratio $\nu/D=1/3$ which
are based on elegant, though strongly simplified assumptions. We argue that
whichever of these numbers comes closest to reality may be determined {\em
observationally} by using spatially resolved mid-infrared measurements of
protoplanetary disks around Herbig stars. If meridional flows are present in
the disk, then we expect less abundance of crystalline dust in the surface
layers, a prediction which can likewise be observationally tested with
mid-infrared interferometers.
"
What is the main subject of the study of the paper?,"  OH 231.8+4.2 is a well studied preplanetary nebula (pPN) around a binary
stellar system that shows a remarkable bipolar outflow. To study the structure
and kinematics of the inner 10-80 AU nebular regions we performed
high-resolution observations of the H$_2$O 6$_{1,6}$--5$_{2,3}$ and $^{28}$SiO
$v$=2, $J$=1--0 maser emissions with the Very Long Baseline Array. The absolute
position of both emission distributions were recovered using the phase
referencing technique, and accurately registered in HST optical images. H$_2$O
maser clumps are found to be distributed in two areas of 20 mas in size
spatially displaced by $\sim$60 milli-arcseconds along an axis oriented nearly
north-south. SiO masers are tentatively found to be placed between the two
H$_2$O maser emitting regions, probably indicating the position of the Mira
component of the system. The SiO maser emission traces an inner equatorial
component with a diameter of 12 AU, probably a disk rotating around the M-type
star. Outwards, we detect in the H$_2$O data a pair of polar caps, separated by
80 AU. We believe that the inner regions of the nebula probably have been
altered by the presence of the companion, leading to an equator-to-pole density
contrast that may explain the lack of H$_2$O masers and strong SiO maser
emission in the denser, equatorial regions.
"
What was the context of Einstein's early calculations of gravitational lensing?,"  Einstein's early calculations of gravitational lensing, contained in a
scratch notebook and dated to the spring of 1912, are reexamined. A hitherto
unknown letter by Einstein suggests that he entertained the idea of explaining
the phenomenon of new stars by gravitational lensing in the fall of 1915 much
more seriously than was previously assumed. A reexamination of the relevant
calculations by Einstein shows that, indeed, at least some of them most likely
date from early October 1915. But in support of earlier historical
interpretation of Einstein's notes, it is argued that the appearance of Nova
Geminorum 1912 (DN Gem) in March 1912 may, in fact, provide a relevant context
and motivation for Einstein's lensing calculations on the occasion of his first
meeting with Erwin Freundlich during a visit in Berlin in April 1912. We also
comment on the significance of Einstein's consideration of gravitational
lensing in the fall of 1915 for the reconstruction of Einstein's final steps in
his path towards general relativity.
"
What are the Zariski dense points on the base curve?,"  Consider a smooth log Fano variety over the function field of a curve.
Suppose that the boundary has positive normal bundle. Choose an integral model
over the curve. Then integral points are Zariski dense, after removing an
explicit finite set of points on the base curve.
"
How do the mechanical quantities such as the energy and momentum of the electromagnetic field in a moving magnetoelectric medium relate to the propagation in the medium?,"  Recently, Feigel has predicted a new effect in magnetoelectric media. The
theoretical evaluation of this effect requires a careful analysis of a dynamics
of the moving magnetoelectric medium and, in particular, the derivation of the
energy-momentum of the electromagnetic field in such a medium. Then, one can
proceed with the study of the wave propagation in this medium and derive the
mechanical quantities such as the energy, the momentum, and their fluxes and
the corresponding forces. In this paper, we develop a consistent
general-relativistic variational approach to the moving dielectric and magnetic
medium with and without magnetoelectric properties. The old experiments in
which the light pressure was measured in fluids are reanalysed in our new
framework.
"
What is the role of mode coupling effects on the dynamics of the diode-pumped solid-state ring laser gyroscope?,"  We report experimental and theoretical study of a rotating diode-pumped
Nd-YAG ring laser with active beat note stabilization. Our experimental setup
is described in the usual Maxwell-Bloch formalism. We analytically derive a
stability condition and some frequency response characteristics for the
solid-state ring laser gyroscope, illustrating the important role of mode
coupling effects on the dynamics of such a device. Experimental data are
presented and compared with the theory on the basis of realistic laser
parameters, showing a very good agreement. Our results illustrate the duality
between the very rich non linear dynamics of the diode-pumped solid-state ring
laser (including chaotic behavior) and the possibility to obtain a very stable
beat note, resulting in a potentially new kind of rotation sensor.
"
What is the holographic model of the chiral symmetry breaking in a ferromagnet?,"  In this paper, we will consider the chiral symmetry breaking in the
holographic model constructed from the intersecting brane configuration, and
investigate the Nambu-Goldstone bosons associated with this symmetry breaking.
"
What are the signatures for distinct incompressible FQHE states in the second Landau level?,"  We present activation gap measurements of the fractional quantum Hall effect
(FQHE) in the second Landau level. Signatures for 14 (5) distinct
incompressible FQHE states are seen in a high (low) mobility sample with the
enigmatic 5/2 even denominator FQHE having a large activation gap of $\sim$600
($\sim$300mK) in the high (low) mobility sample. Our measured large relative
gaps for 5/2, 7/3, and 8/3 FQHE indicate emergence of exotic FQHE correlations
in the second Ladau level, possibly quite different from the well-known lowest
Landau level Laughlin correlations. Our measured 5/2 gap is found to be in
reasonable agreement with the theoretical gap once finite width and disorder
broadening corrections are taken into account.
"
What are the implications of the two-way wire-tap channels for wire-tapped scenarios?,"  We consider two-way wire-tap channels, where two users are communicating with
each other in the presence of an eavesdropper, who has access to the
communications through a multiple-access channel. We find achievable rates for
two different scenarios, the Gaussian two-way wire-tap channel, (GTW-WT), and
the binary additive two-way wire-tap channel, (BATW-WT). It is shown that the
two-way channels inherently provide a unique advantage for wire-tapped
scenarios, as the users know their own transmitted signals and in effect help
encrypt the other user's messages, similar to a one-time pad. We compare the
achievable rates to that of the Gaussian multiple-access wire-tap channel
(GMAC-WT) to illustrate this advantage.
"
What is the relation between pressure and energy density in lattice QCD?,"  We construct a family of equations of state within a quasiparticle model by
relating pressure, energy density, baryon density and susceptibilities adjusted
to first-principles lattice QCD calculations. The relation between pressure and
energy density from lattice QCD is surprisingly insensitive to details of the
simulations. Effects from different lattice actions, quark masses and lattice
spacings used in the simulations show up mostly in the quark-hadron phase
transition region which we bridge over by a set of interpolations to a hadron
resonance gas equation of state. Within our optimized quasiparticle model we
then examine the equation of state along isentropic expansion trajectories at
small net baryon densities, as relevant for experiments and hydrodynamic
simulations at RHIC and LHC energies. We illustrate its impact on azimuthal
flow anisotropies and transverse momentum spectra of various hadron species.
"
What are the two boosted velocity parameters of black holes?,"  We construct an exact stationary solution of black hole -- bubble sequence in
the five dimensional Kaluza-Klein theory by using solitonic solution generating
techniques. The solution describes two boosted black holes with topology S^3 on
a Kaluza-Klein bubble and has a linear momentum component in the compactified
direction. The ADM mass and the linear momentum depend on the two boosted
velocity parameters of black holes. In the effective four dimensional theory,
the solution has an electric charge which is proportional to the linear
momentum. The solution includes the static solution found by Elvang and
Horowitz and a limit of single boosted black string.
"
What is the Gillespie Algorithm used to simulate chemical reaction systems?,"  Chemical reaction systems with a low to moderate number of molecules are
typically modeled as discrete jump Markov processes. These systems are
oftentimes simulated with methods that produce statistically exact sample paths
such as the Gillespie Algorithm or the Next Reaction Method. In this paper we
make explicit use of the fact that the initiation times of the reactions can be
represented as the firing times of independent, unit rate Poisson processes
with internal times given by integrated propensity functions. Using this
representation we derive a modified Next Reaction Method and, in a way that
achieves efficiency over existing approaches for exact simulation, extend it to
systems with time dependent propensities as well as to systems with delays.
"
What are the properties of spherical needlets?,"  We discuss Spherical Needlets and their properties. Needlets are a form of
spherical wavelets which do not rely on any kind of tangent plane approximation
and enjoy good localization properties in both pixel and harmonic space;
moreover needlets coefficients are asymptotically uncorrelated at any fixed
angular distance, which makes their use in statistical procedures very
promising. In view of these properties, we believe needlets may turn out to be
especially useful in the analysis of Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data on
the incomplete sky, as well as of other cosmological observations. As a final
advantage, we stress that the implementation of needlets is computationally
very convenient and may rely completely on standard data analysis packages such
as HEALPix.
"
"What are the properties of the solution u(x,t) in the Navier-Stokes equations?","  The object of the present paper is to show the existence and the uniqueness
of a reproductive strong solution of the Navier-Stokes equations, i.e. the
solution $\boldsymbol{u} $ belongs to $\text{}\mathbf{L}% ^{\infty}(0,T;V) \cap
\mathbf{L}^{2}(0,T;\mathbf{H}% ^{2}(\Omega))$ and satisfies the property
$\boldsymbol{u}% (\boldsymbol{x,}T) =\boldsymbol{u}% (\boldsymbol{x,}0)
=\boldsymbol{u}_{0}(\boldsymbol{x})$. One considers the case of an
incompressible fluid in two dimensions with nonhomogeneous boundary conditions,
and external forces are neglected.
"
What is the I-divergence between different models for the construction of an optimal approximate normal factor analysis model?,"  In this paper we make a first attempt at understanding how to build an
optimal approximate normal factor analysis model. The criterion we have chosen
to evaluate the distance between different models is the I-divergence between
the corresponding normal laws. The algorithm that we propose for the
construction of the best approximation is of an the alternating minimization
kind.
"
What is the energy spectrum of the Crab Nebula observed with the MAGIC telescope?,"  We report about very high energy (VHE) gamma-ray observations of the Crab
Nebula with the MAGIC telescope. The gamma-ray flux from the nebula was
measured between 60 GeV and 9 TeV. The energy spectrum can be described with a
curved power law dF/dE=f0 (E/300 GeV)^(a+b*log10(E/300 GeV)) with a flux
normalization f0 of(6.0+-0.2)*10^-10 1/(cm^2 s TeV), a=-2.31+-0.06 and
b=-0.26+-0.07. The position of the IC-peak is determined at (77+-47) GeV.
Within the observation time and the experimental resolution of the telescope,
the gamma-ray emission is steady and pointlike. The emission's center of
gravity coincides with the position of the pulsar. Pulsed gamma-ray emission
from the pulsar could not be detected. We constrain the cutoff energy of the
spectrum to be less than 27 GeV, assuming that the differential energy spectrum
has an exponential cutoff. For a super-exponential shape, the cutoff energy can
be as high as 60 GeV.
"
What are the roles of surface operators in gauge theories in four dimensions?,"  Topological gauge theories in four dimensions which admit surface operators
provide a natural framework for realizing homological knot invariants. Every
such theory leads to an action of the braid group on branes on the
corresponding moduli space. This action plays a key role in the construction of
homological knot invariants. We illustrate the general construction with
examples based on surface operators in N=2 and N=4 twisted gauge theories which
lead to a categorification of the Alexander polynomial, the equivariant knot
signature, and certain analogs of the Casson invariant.
  This paper is based on a lecture delivered at the International Congress on
Mathematical Physics 2006, Rio de Janeiro, and at the RTN Workshop 2006,
Napoli.
"
What is the impact of improved Te and [Fe/H] calibrations for early F stars on the determination of isochrone ages?,"  Ages, metallicities, space velocities, and Galactic orbits of stars in the
Solar neighbourhood are fundamental observational constraints on models of
galactic disk evolution. We aim to consolidate the calibrations of uvby
photometry into Te, [Fe/H], distance, and age for F and G stars and rediscuss
the results of the Geneva-Copenhagen Survey (Nordstrom et al. 2004; GCS) in
terms of the evolution of the disk.
  We substantially improve the Te and [Fe/H] calibrations for early F stars,
where spectroscopic temperatures have large systematic errors. Our recomputed
ages are in excellent agreement with the independent determinations by Takeda
et al. (2007), indicating that isochrone ages can now be reliably determined.
  The revised G-dwarf metallicity distribution remains incompatible with
closed-box models, and the age-metallicity relation for the thin disk remains
almost flat, with large and real scatter at all ages (sigma intrinsic = 0.20
dex). Dynamical heating of the thin disk continues throughout its life;
specific in-plane dynamical effects dominate the evolution of the U and V
velocities, while the W velocities remain random at all ages. When assigning
thick and thin-disk membership for stars from kinematic criteria, parameters
for the oldest stars should be used to characterise the thin disk.
"
What is the definition of a von Neumann algebra M being normal?,"  A pure state f of a von Neumann algebra M is called classically normal if f
is normal on any von Neumann subalgebra of M on which f is multiplicative.
Assuming the continuum hypothesis, a separably represented von Neumann algebra
M has classically normal, singular pure states iff there is a central
projection p in M such that Mp is a factor of type I_\infty, II, or III.
"
What is the relationship between the Chern characters in the mixed characteristic case?,"  In 1987 Roberts completed the proof of the New Intersection Theorem (NIT) by
settling the mixed characteristic case using local Chern characters, as
developed by Fulton and also by Roberts. His proof has been the only one
recorded of the NIT in mixed characteristic.
  This paper gives a new proof of this theorem, one which mostly parallels
Roberts' original proof, but avoids the use of local Chern characters. Instead,
the proof here uses Adams operations on K-theory with supports as developed by
Gillet-Soule.
"
What are the implications of the couplings of the inflaton to scalar and gauge fields on the inflaton potential?,"  We study preheating in theories where the inflaton couples derivatively to
scalar and gauge fields. Such couplings may dominate in natural models of
inflation, in which the flatness of the inflaton potential is related to an
approximate shift symmetry of the inflaton. We compare our results with
previously studied models with non-derivative couplings. For sufficiently heavy
scalar matter, parametric resonance is ineffective in reheating the universe,
because the couplings of the inflaton to matter are very weak. If scalar matter
fields are light, derivative couplings lead to a mild long-wavelength
instability that drives matter fields to non-zero expectation values. In this
case however, long-wavelength fluctuations of the light scalar are produced
during inflation, leading to a host of cosmological problems. In contrast,
axion-like couplings of the inflaton to a gauge field do not lead to production
of long-wavelength fluctuations during inflation. However, again because of the
weakness of the couplings to the inflaton, parametric resonance is not
effective in producing gauge field quanta.
"
What are the advantages of the new telescope system for detecting molecular emission lines?,"  We have upgraded the 60-cm radio survey telescope located in Nobeyama, Japan.
We developed a new waveguide-type sideband-separating SIS mixer for the
telescope, which enables the simultaneous detection of distinct molecular
emission lines both in the upper and lower sidebands. Over the RF frequency
range of 205-240 GHz, the single-sideband receiver noise temperatures of the
new mixer are 40-100 K for the 4.0-8.0 GHz IF frequency band. The image
rejection ratios are greater than 10 dB over the same range. For the dual IF
signals obtained by the receiver, we have developed two sets of acousto-optical
spectrometers and a telescope control system. Using the new telescope system,
we successfully detected the 12CO (J=2-1) and 13CO (J=2-1) emission lines
simultaneously toward Orion KL in 2005 March. Using the waveguide-type
sideband-separating SIS mixer for the 200 GHz band, we have initiated the first
simultaneous 12CO (J=2-1) and 13CO (J=2-1) survey of the galactic plane as well
as large-scale mapping observations of nearby molecular clouds.
"
How does the Witten-Veneziano relation influence the masses and decay constants of the pseudoscalar nonet?,"  We study the temperature dependence of the pseudoscalar meson properties in a
relativistic bound-state approach exhibiting the chiral behavior mandated by
QCD. Concretely, we adopt the Dyson-Schwinger approach with a rank-2 separable
model interaction. After extending the model to the strange sector and fixing
its parameters at zero temperature, T=0, we study the T-dependence of the
masses and decay constants of all ground-state mesons in the pseudoscalar
nonet. Of chief interest are $\eta$ and $\eta^\prime$. The influence of the QCD
axial anomaly on them is successfully obtained through the Witten-Veneziano
relation at T=0. The same approach is then extended to T>0, using lattice QCD
results for the topological susceptibility. The most conspicuous finding is an
increase of the $\eta^\prime$ mass around the chiral restoration temperature
$T_{\rm Ch}$, which would suggest a suppression of $\eta^\prime$ production in
relativistic heavy-ion collisions. The increase of the $\eta^\prime$ mass may
also indicate that the extension of the Witten-Veneziano relation to finite
temperatures becomes unreliable around and above $T_{\rm Ch}$. Possibilities of
an improved treatment are discussed.
"
What are the properties of the metric operators associated with a Hermitian and a Hamiltonian?,"  We give a simple proof of the fact that every diagonalizable operator that
has a real spectrum is quasi-Hermitian and show how the metric operators
associated with a quasi-Hermitian Hamiltonian are related to the symmetry
generators of an equivalent Hermitian Hamiltonian.
"
What is the homotopy filtration of the group of homotopy self-equivalences of a manifold?,"  We will prove the relative homotopy principle for smooth maps with
singularities of a given {\cal K}-invariant class with a mild condition. We
next study a filtration of the group of homotopy self-equivalences of a given
manifold P by considering singularities of non-negative {\cal K}-codimensions.
"
What is the weak phase gamma in the context of SU(3) symmetry breaking?,"  When CP asymmetries in $B^0(t)\to \pi^+ \pi^-$ are combined using broken
flavor SU(3) with decay rates for $B^+\to K^0\pi^+$ and/or $B^0\to K^+\pi^-$,
one can obtain stringent limits on the weak phase $\gamma$ which are consistent
with those obtained from other CKM constraints. Experimental data in the past
few years have improved to the extent that systematic errors associated with
uncertainty in SU(3) symmetry breaking dominate the determination of $\gamma$.
We obtain a value $\gamma =(73 \pm 4^{+10}_{-8})^\circ$, where the first error
is statistical while the second one is systematic.
"
What are the implications of the abundance of dark matter for the reheating temperature of the universe after inflation?,"  We study the consequences of the gravitino decay into dark matter. We suppose
that the lightest neutralino is the main component of dark matter. In our
framework gravitino is heavy enough to decay before Big Bang Nucleosynthesis
starts. We consider a model coming from a five dimensional supergravity
compactified on $S^1/Z_2$ with gravity in the bulk and matter localized on
tensionless branes at the orbifold fixed points. We require that the dark
matter, which is produced thermally and in the decay of Kaluza-Klein modes of
gravitino, has an abundance compatible with observation. We deduce from our
model that there are curves of constraints between the size of the
extra-dimension and the reheating temperature of the universe after inflation.
This talk is based on hep-ph/0702183 to be published in \PRD.
"
What are the necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of an integer n such that $\mu^{*n}$ is stochastically dominated by $\nu^{*n}$ for two given probability measures $\mu$ and $\nu$?,"  We study how iterated convolutions of probability measures compare under
stochastic domination. We give necessary and sufficient conditions for the
existence of an integer $n$ such that $\mu^{*n}$ is stochastically dominated by
$\nu^{*n}$ for two given probability measures $\mu$ and $\nu$. As a consequence
we obtain a similar theorem on the majorization order for vectors in $\R^d$. In
particular we prove results about catalysis in quantum information theory.
"
What is the total absolute curvature of the level?,"  Given a definable function f, enough differentiable, we study the continuity
of the total curvature function t --> K(t), total curvature of the level {f=t},
and the total absolute curvature function t-->|K| (t), total absolute curvature
of the level {f=t}. We show they admits at most finitely many discontinuities.
"
What is the average velocity dispersion of an L* galaxy at a redshift of 0.3?,"  We present the first galaxy-galaxy weak lensing results using early data from
the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey (CFHTLS). These results are
based on ~22 sq. deg. of i' data. From this data, we estimate the average
velocity dispersion for an L* galaxy at a redshift of 0.3 to be 137 +- 11 km/s,
with a virial mass, M_{200}, of 1.1 +- 0.2 \times 10^{12} h^{-1} Msun and a
rest frame R-band mass-to-light ratio of 173 +- 34 h Msun/Lsun. We also
investigate various possible sources of systematic error in detail.
Additionally, we separate our lens sample into two sub-samples, divided by
apparent magnitude, thus average redshift. From this early data we do not
detect significant evolution in galaxy dark matter halo mass-to-light ratios
from a redshift of 0.45 to 0.27. Finally, we test for non-spherical galaxy dark
matter halos. Our results favor a dark matter halo with an ellipticity of ~0.3
at the 2-sigma level when averaged over all galaxies. If the sample of
foreground lens galaxies is selected to favor ellipticals, the mean halo
ellipticity and significance of this result increase.
"
What is the relationship between the radio-loudness of AGNs and their accretion luminosity?,"  We investigate how the total radio luminosity of AGN-powered radio sources
depends on their accretion luminosity and the central black hole mass. We find
that AGNs form two distinct and well separated sequences on the radio-loudness
- Eddington-ratio plane. We argue that these sequences mark the real upper
bounds of radio-loudness of two distinct populations of AGNs: those hosted
respectively by elliptical and disk galaxies. Both sequences show the same
dependence of the radio-loudness on the Eddington ratio (an increase with
decreasing Eddington ratio), which suggests that another parameter in addition
to the accretion rate must play a role in determining the jet production
efficiency in active galactic nuclei, and that this parameter is related to
properties of the host galaxy. The revealed host-related radio dichotomy breaks
down at high accretion rates where the dominant fraction of luminous quasars
hosted by elliptical galaxies is radio quiet. We argue that the huge difference
between the radio-loudness reachable by AGNs in disc and elliptical galaxies
can be explained by the scenario according to which the spin of a black hole
determines the outflow's power, and central black holes can reach large spins
only in early type galaxies (following major mergers), and not (in a
statistical sense) in spiral galaxies.
"
What are the key concepts in a Gaussian multiple relay channel?,"  In this paper, we study a routing problem on the Gaussian multiple relay
channel, in which nodes employ a decode-and-forward coding strategy. We are
interested in routes for the information flow through the relays that achieve
the highest DF rate. We first construct an algorithm that provably finds
optimal DF routes. As the algorithm runs in factorial time in the worst case,
we propose a polynomial time heuristic algorithm that finds an optimal route
with high probability. We demonstrate that that the optimal (and near optimal)
DF routes are good in practice by simulating a distributed DF coding scheme
using low density parity check codes with puncturing and incremental
redundancy.
"
What are the implications of the observed X-ray variability of the binary system CC Eri?,"  Context: Weak flares are supposed to be an important heating agent of the
outer layers of stellar atmospheres. However, due to instrumental limitations,
only large X-ray flares have been studied in detail until now.
  Aims: We used an XMM-Newton observation of the very active BY-Dra type binary
star CC Eri in order to investigate the properties of two flares that are
weaker than those typically studied in the literature.
  Methods: We performed time-resolved spectroscopy of the data taken with the
EPIC-PN CCD camera. A multi-temperature model was used to fit the spectra. We
inferred the size of the flaring loops using the density-temperature diagram.
The loop scaling laws were applied for deriving physical parameters of the
flaring plasma. We also estimated the number of loops involved in the observed
flares.
  Results: A large X-ray variability was found. Spectral analysis showed that
all the regions in the light curve, including the flare segments, are
well-described by a 3-T model with variable emission measures but,
surprisingly, with constant temperatures (values of 3, 10 and 22 MK). The
analysed flares lasted ~ 3.4 and 7.1 ks, with flux increases of factors
1.5-1.9. They occurred in arcades made of a few tens of similar coronal loops.
The size of the flaring loops is much smaller than the distance between the
stellar surfaces in the binary system, and even smaller than the radius of each
of the stars. The obtained results are consistent with the following ideas: (i)
the whole X-ray light curve of CC Eri could be the result of a superposition of
multiple low-energy flares, and (ii) stellar flares can be scaled-up versions
of solar flares.
"
What are the Bogoliubov coefficients used in the calculation?,"  We study the behaviour of fermions localized on moving kinks as these collide
with either antikinks or spacetime boundaries. We numerically solve for the
evolution of the scalar kinks and the bound (i.e. localized) fermion modes, and
calculate the number of fermions transfered to the antikink and boundary in
terms of Bogoliubov coefficients. Interpreting the boundary as the brane on
which we live, this models the ability of fermions on branes incoming from the
bulk to ``stick'' on the world brane, even when the incoming branes bounce back
into the bulk.
"
What are the implications of the Galilei invariance and its relation to physically consistent systems?,"  Galilei invariant equations for massive fields with various spins are found
and classified. They have been obtained directly, i.e., by using requirement of
Galilei invariance and the facts on representations of the Galilei group
deduced in our previous paper de Montigny M, Niederle J and Nikitin A G, J.
Phys. A {\bf 39}, 1-21, 2006 . It is shown that the collection of
non-equivalent Galilei-invariant wave equations for vector and scalar fields is
very broad and describes many physically consistent systems.
"
How do the dynamics of small and large groups differ in social networks?,"  The rich set of interactions between individuals in the society results in
complex community structure, capturing highly connected circles of friends,
families, or professional cliques in a social network. Thanks to frequent
changes in the activity and communication patterns of individuals, the
associated social and communication network is subject to constant evolution.
Our knowledge of the mechanisms governing the underlying community dynamics is
limited, but is essential for a deeper understanding of the development and
self-optimisation of the society as a whole. We have developed a new algorithm
based on clique percolation, that allows, for the first time, to investigate
the time dependence of overlapping communities on a large scale and as such, to
uncover basic relationships characterising community evolution. Our focus is on
networks capturing the collaboration between scientists and the calls between
mobile phone users. We find that large groups persist longer if they are
capable of dynamically altering their membership, suggesting that an ability to
change the composition results in better adaptability. The behaviour of small
groups displays the opposite tendency, the condition for stability being that
their composition remains unchanged. We also show that the knowledge of the
time commitment of the members to a given community can be used for estimating
the community's lifetime. These findings offer a new view on the fundamental
differences between the dynamics of small groups and large institutions.
"
What are the implications of the Entropy Penalized Method for the geometry of accretion flow in X-ray binaries?,"  We provide a short and elementary proof for the recently proved result by G.
da Prato and H. Frankowska that -- under minimal assumptions -- a closed set is
invariant with respect to a stochastic control system if and only if it is
invariant with respect to the (associated) deterministic control system.

What is the behavior of the directed current in one-dimensional systems of Dirac fermions driven by local periodic potentials?,"  We investigate the behavior of the directed current in one-dimensional
systems of Dirac fermions driven by local periodic potentials in the forward as
well in backscattering channels. We treat the problem with Keldysh
non-equilibrium Green's function formalism. We present the exact solution for
the case of an infinite wire and show that in this case the dc current vanishes
identically. We also investigate a confined system consistent in an annular
arrangement coupled to a particle reservoir. We present a perturbative
treatment that allows for the analytical expressions of the dc current in the
lowest order of the amplitudes of the potential. We also present results
obtained from the exact numerical solution of the problem.
"
What is the behavior of highly extended 5d electrons in Y2Ir2O7 observed by high resolution photoemission spectroscopy?,"  We report the observation of an unusual behavior of highly extended 5d
electrons in Y2Ir2O7 belonging to pyrochlore family of great current interest
using high resolution photoemission spectroscopy. The experimental bulk spectra
reveal an intense lower Hubbard band in addition to weak intensities in the
vicinity of the Fermi level, e_F. This provides a direct evidence for strong
electron correlation among the 5d electrons, despite their highly extended
nature. The high resolution spectrum at room temperature exhibits a pseudogap
at e_F and |e - e_F|^2 dependence demonstrating the importance of electron
correlation in this system. Remarkably, in the magnetically ordered phase (T <
150 K), the spectral lineshape evolves to a |e - e_F|^1.5 dependence
emphasizing the dominant role of electron-magnon coupling.
"
What is the relationship between the coupling of the ρ meson with any hadron H and the number of hadrons?,"  The couplings $g_{\rho HH}$ of the $\rho$ meson with any hadron H are
calculated in a holographic dual of QCD where the Regge trajectories for mesons
are manifest. The resulting couplings grow linearly with the exciting number of
H, thus are far from universal. A simple argument has been given for this
behavior based on quasi-classical picture of excited hadrons. It seems that in
holographic duals with exact Regge trajectories the $g_{\rho HH}$ universality
should be violated. The $\rho$-dominance for the electromagnetic form factors
of H are also strongly violated, except for the lowest state, the pion. Quite
unexpected, the form factor of the pion is completely saturated by the
contribution of the $\rho$. The asymptotic behavior of the form factors are
also calculated, and are found to be perfectly accordant with the prediction of
conformal symmetry and pertubative QCD.
"
What is the relationship between the effective strain of nonlocal interactions and the viscosity in energy balance?,"  It is shown that nonlocal interactions determine energy spectrum in isotropic
turbulence at small Reynolds numbers. It is also shown that for moderate
Reynolds numbers the bottleneck effect is determined by the same nonlocal
interactions. Role of the large and small scales covariance at the nonlocal
interactions and in energy balance has been investigated. A possible
hydrodynamic mechanism of the nonlocal solution instability at large scales has
been briefly discussed. A quantitative relationship between effective strain of
the nonlocal interactions and viscosity has been found. All results are
supported by comparison with the data of experiments and numerical simulations.
"
What is the response of degree-correlated scale-free attractor networks to stimuli?,"  The response of degree-correlated scale-free attractor networks to stimuli is
studied. We show that degree-correlated scale-free networks are robust to
random stimuli as well as the uncorrelated scale-free networks, while
assortative (disassortative) scale-free networks are more (less) sensitive to
directed stimuli than uncorrelated networks. We find that the
degree-correlation of scale-free networks makes the dynamics of attractor
systems different from uncorrelated ones. The dynamics of correlated scale-free
attractor networks result in the effects of degree correlation on the response
to stimuli.
"
What are the implications of matched filtering of LIGO science data for the detection of low mass binary systems in the halo of dark matter surrounding the Milky Way?,"  The Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO) is one of a
new generation of detectors of gravitational radiation. The existence of
gravitational radiation was first predicted by Einstein in 1916, however
gravitational waves have not yet been directly observed. One source of
gravitation radiation is binary inspiral. Two compact bodies orbiting each
other, such as a pair of black holes, lose energy to gravitational radiation.
As the system loses energy the bodies spiral towards each other. This causes
their orbital speed and the amount of gravitational radiation to increase,
producing a characteristic ``chirp'' waveform in the LIGO sensitive band. In
this thesis, matched filtering of LIGO science data is used to search for low
mass binary systems in the halo of dark matter surrounding the Milky Way.
Observations of gravitational microlensing events of stars in the Large
Magellanic Cloud suggest that some fraction of the dark matter in the halo may
be in the form of Massive Astrophysical Compact Halo Objects (MACHOs). It has
been proposed that low mass black holes formed in the early universe may be a
component of the MACHO population; some fraction of these black hole MACHOs
will be in binary systems and detectable by LIGO. The inspiral from a MACHO
binary composed of two 0.5 solar mass black holes enters the LIGO sensitive
band around 40 Hz. The chirp signal increases in amplitude and frequency,
sweeping through the sensitive band to 4400 Hz in 140 seconds. By using
evidence from microlensing events and theoretical predictions of the population
an upper limit is placed on the rate of black hole MACHO inspirals in the
galactic halo.
"
What is the significance of the k-th power of a matrix in the Maple algorithm?,"  We give a new procedure in Maple for finding the k-th power of a martix. The
algorithm is based on the article [1].
"
What are the conditions for observing the strong correlation effect in a two-component system of bosonic ultracold atoms?,"  We show that one of the key characteristics of interacting one-dimensional
electronic quantum systems, the separation of spin and charge, can be observed
in a two-component system of bosonic ultracold atoms even close to a competing
phase separation regime. To this purpose we determine the real-time evolution
of a single particle excitation and the single-particle spectral function using
density-matrix renormalization group techniques. Due to efficient bosonic
cooling and good tunability this setup exhibits very good conditions for
observing this strong correlation effect. In anticipation of experimental
realizations we calculate the velocities for spin and charge perturbations for
a wide range of parameters.
"
What are the simplest gradings of Lie superalgebras with Cartan matrix of rank 2?,"  Over algebraically closed fields of characteristic p>2, prolongations of the
simple finite dimensional Lie algebras and Lie superalgebras with Cartan matrix
are studied for certain simplest gradings of these algebras. Several new simple
Lie superalgebras are discovered, serial and exceptional, including superBrown
and superMelikyan superalgebras. Simple Lie superalgebras with Cartan matrix of
rank 2 are classified.
"
What is the definition of simultaneity in the special theory of relativity?,"  It is proved that the definition of simultaneity by Einstein leads to the
paradox motion of he string from the viewpoint of the observer in the inertial
system S' moving with velocity v with regard to the inertial system S.
"
What is the energy momentum tensor flux required to cancel gravitational anomaly at the event horizon of a Schwarzschild black hole?,"  Robinson-Wilczek's recent work shows that, the energy momentum tensor flux
required to cancel gravitational anomaly at the event horizon of a
Schwarzschild-type black hole has an equivalent form to that of a
(1+1)-dimensional blackbody radiation at the Hawking temperature. Motivated by
their work, Hawking radiation from the cosmological horizons of the general
Schwarzschild-de Sitter and Kerr-de Sitter black holes, has been studied by the
method of anomaly cancellation. The result shows that the absorbing gauge
current and energy momentum tensor fluxes required to cancel gauge and
gravitational anomalies at the cosmological horizon are precisely equal to
those of Hawking radiation from it. It should be emphasized that the effective
field theory for generic black holes in de Sitter spaces should be formulated
within the region between the event horizon (EH) and the cosmological horizon
(CH), to integrate out the classically irrelevant ingoing modes at the EH and
the classically irrelevant outgoing modes at the CH, respectively.
"
What are the integrals in the spinor superspace for a one-loop and two-loop amplitude?,"  The pure spinor formulation of the ten-dimensional superstring leads to
manifestly supersymmetric loop amplitudes, expressed as integrals in pure
spinor superspace. This paper explores different methods to evaluate these
integrals and then uses them to calculate the kinematic factors of the one-loop
and two-loop massless four-point amplitudes involving two and four Ramond
states.
"
What are the advantages of the vanishing moment method for approximating solutions of second-order fully nonlinear PDEs?,"  This paper concerns with numerical approximations of solutions of second
order fully nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs). A new notion of
weak solutions, called moment solutions, is introduced for second order fully
nonlinear PDEs. Unlike viscosity solutions, moment solutions are defined by a
constructive method, called vanishing moment method, hence, they can be readily
computed by existing numerical methods such as finite difference, finite
element, spectral Galerkin, and discontinuous Galerkin methods with
""guaranteed"" convergence. The main idea of the proposed vanishing moment method
is to approximate a second order fully nonlinear PDE by a higher order, in
particular, a fourth order quasilinear PDE. We show by various numerical
experiments the viability of the proposed vanishing moment method. All our
numerical experiments show the convergence of the vanishing moment method, and
they also show that moment solutions coincide with viscosity solutions whenever
the latter exist.
"
What is the relationship between a compact plane billiard and a smooth curve?,"  We prove that every compact plane billiard, bounded by a smooth curve, is
insecure: there exist pairs of points $A,B$ such that no finite set of points
can block all billiard trajectories from $A$ to $B$.
"
What is the impact of quenched disorder on the pinning-depinning transition point in a random walk on a half-line?,"  We consider wetting of a one-dimensional random walk on a half-line $x\ge 0$
in a short-ranged potential located at the origin $x=0$. We demonstrate
explicitly how the presence of a quenched chemical disorder affects the
pinning-depinning transition point. For small disorders we develop a
perturbative technique which enables us to compute explicitly the averaged
temperature (energy) of the pinning transition. For strong disorder we compute
the transition point both numerically and using the renormalization group
approach. Our consideration is based on the following idea: the random
potential can be viewed as a periodic potential with the period $n$ in the
limit $n\to\infty$. The advantage of our approach stems from the ability to
integrate exactly over all spatial degrees of freedoms in the model and to
reduce the initial problem to the analysis of eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of
some special non-Hermitian random matrix with disorder--dependent diagonal and
constant off-diagonal coefficients. We show that even for strong disorder the
shift of the averaged pinning point of the random walk in the ensemble of
random realizations of substrate disorder is indistinguishable from the pinning
point of the system with preaveraged (i.e. annealed) Boltzmann weight.
"
What is the significance of the results of the searches for single-top-quark production at the Tevatron?,"  This article reports on recent searches for single-top-quark production by
the CDF collaboration at the Tevatron using a data set that corresponds to an
integrated luminosity of 955 pb^-1. Three different analyses techniques are
employed, one using likelihood discriminants, one neural networks and one
matrix elements. The sensitivity to single-top production at the rate predicted
by the standard model ranges from 2.1 to 2.6 sigma. While the first two
analyses observe a deficit of single-top like events compared to the
expectation, the matrix element method observes an excess corresponding to a
background fluctuation of 2.3 sigma. The null results of the likelihood and
neural network analyses translate in upper limits on the cross section of 2.6\
pb for the t-channel production mode and 3.7 pb for the s-channel mode at the
95% C.L. The matrix element result corresponds to a measurement of
2.7^+1.5_-1.3 pb for the combined t- and s-channel single-top cross section. In
addition, CDF has searched for non-standard model production of
single-top-quarks via the s-channel exchange of a heavy W^\prime boson. No
signal of this process is found resulting in lower mass limits of 760 GeV/c^2
in case the mass of the right-handed neutrino is smaller than the mass of the
right-handed W^\prime or 790 GeV/c^2 in the opposite case.
"
What is the condition for the imaginary part of $\chi$ to be nonnegative?,"  The resolution associated with the so-called perfect lens of thickness $d$ is
$-2\pi d/\ln(|\chi+2|/2)$. Here the susceptibility $\chi$ is a Hermitian
function in $H^2$ of the upper half-plane, i.e., a $H^2$ function satisfying
$\chi(-\omega)=\bar{\chi(\omega)}$. An additional requirement is that the
imaginary part of $\chi$ be nonnegative for nonnegative arguments. Given an
interval $I$ on the positive half-axis, we compute the distance in
$L^\infty(I)$ from a negative constant to this class of functions. This result
gives a surprisingly simple and explicit formula for the optimal resolution of
the perfect lens on a finite bandwidth.
"
What are the implications of the SHDM model for the production of Ultra High Energy Cosmic Rays?,"  Super Heavy quasi-stable particles are naturally produced in the early
universe and could represent a substantial fraction of the Dark Matter: the
so-called Super Heavy Dark Matter (SHDM). The decay of SHDM represents also a
possible source of Ultra High Energy Cosmic Rays (UHECR), with a reliably
calculated spectrum of the particles produced in the decay $(\propto
E^{-1.9})$. The SHDM model for the production of UHECR can explain
quantitatively only the excess of UHE events observed by AGASA. In the case of
an observed spectrum not showing the AGASA excess the SHDM model can provide
only a {\it subdominant} contribution to the UHECR flux. We discuss here the
basic features of SHDM for the production of a {\it subdominant} UHECR flux, we
refer our study to the possible signatures of the model at the Auger
observatory discussing in particular the expected chemical composition and
anisotropy.
"
What are the restricted class of operators that inherit the self-adjointness of the reduced Laplace-Beltrami operators?,"  The self-adjointness of the reduced Hamiltonian operators arising from the
Laplace-Beltrami operator of a complete Riemannian manifold through quantum
Hamiltonian reduction based on a compact isometry group is studied. A simple
sufficient condition is provided that guarantees the inheritance of essential
self-adjointness onto a certain class of restricted operators and allows us to
conclude the self-adjointness of the reduced Laplace-Beltrami operators in a
concise way. As a consequence, the self-adjointness of spin Calogero-Sutherland
type reductions of `free' Hamiltonians under polar actions of compact Lie
groups follows immediately.
"
What is the effect of brood age on parental care behavior in ducks?,"  In birds, the link between parental care behaviour and prolactin release
during incubation persists after hatching in altricial birds, but has never
been precisely studied during the whole rearing period in precocial species,
such as ducks. The present study aims to understand how changes in parental
care after hatching are related to circulating prolactin levels in mallard hens
rearing ducklings. Blood was sampled in hens over at least 13 post-hatching
weeks and the behaviour of the hens and the ducklings was recorded daily until
fledging. Contacts between hens and the ducklings, leadership of the ducklings
and gathering of them steadily decreased over post-hatching time. Conversely,
resting, preening and agonistic behaviour of hens towards ducklings increased.
Plasma prolactin concentrations remained at high levels after hatching and then
fell after week 6 when body mass and structural size of the young were close to
those of the hen. Parental care behaviour declined linearly with brood age,
showed a disruption of the hen-brood bond at week 6 post-hatching and was
related to prolactin concentration according to a sigmoid function. Our results
suggest that a definite threshold in circulating prolactin is necessary to
promote and/or to maintain post-hatching parental care in ducks.
"
What is the relationship between the Coxeter system and the CW-complex in a 3-sphere?,"  Given a Coxeter system (W,S), there is an associated CW-complex, Sigma, on
which W acts properly and cocompactly. We prove that when the nerve L of (W,S)
is a flag triangulation of the 3-sphere, then the reduced $\ell^2$-homology of
Sigma vanishes in all but the middle dimension.
"
What is the product of the four-velocities of $B^-$ and $D^{*0}$ in the $B^-\to D^{*0} e^-\bar\nu_e$ decay?,"  Using 226 million $B\bar{B}$ events recorded on the $\Upsilon(4S)$ resonance
with the BABAR detector at the SLAC $e^+e^-$ storage rings PEPII, we
reconstruct $B^-\to D^{*0} e^-\bar\nu_e$ decays using the decay chain
$D^{*0}\to{}D^0{}\pi^0$ and $D^{0}\to{}K^-\pi^+$. From the dependence of their
differential rate on $w$, the product of the four-velocities of $B^-${} and
$D^{*0}$, and using the description of the form factor $F(w)$ by Caprini et
al., we obtain the preliminary results $\rho^2_{A_1} = 1.15\pm 0.06 \pm 0.08$,
$F(1)\cdot|V_{cb}| = (36.3\pm 0.6 \pm 1.4)\cdot 10^{-3}$, and ${\cal B}(B^-\to
D^{*0} e^-\bar\nu_e) = (5.71\pm 0.08\pm 0.41)%$. The first errors are
statistical and the second ones are systematic. \\
"
What are the constraints on the DM parameters imposed by the measured specific heat of the material?,"  We study the consequences of in-plane (D_p) and out-of-plane (D_z)
Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya (DM) interactions on the thermodynamic properties of
spin-1/2} Heisenberg model on the kagome lattice using numerical linked cluster
expansions and exact diagonalization, and contrast them with those of other
perturbations such as exchange anisotropy and dilution. We find that different
combinations of the DM anisotropies lead to a wide variety of thermodynamic
behavior, which are quite distinct from those of most other perturbations. We
argue that the sudden upturn seen experimentally in the susceptibility of the
material ZnCu3(OH)6Cl2 can be understood in terms of Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya
anisotropies with D_p>|D_z|. We also show that the measured specific heat of
the material puts further constraints on the allowed DM parameters.
"
What is the Shack-Hartmann sensor improved by using a cylindrical lenslet array?,"  We present a design improvement for a recently proposed type of
Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor that uses a cylindrical (lenticular) lenslet
array. The improved sensor design uses optical binning and requires
significantly fewer detector pixels than the corresponding conventional or
cylindrical Shack-Hartmann sensor, and so detector readout noise causes less
signal degradation. Additionally, detector readout time is significantly
reduced, which reduces the latency for closed loop systems, and data processing
requirements. We provide simple analytical noise considerations and Monte-Carlo
simulations, and show that the optically binned Shack-Hartmann sensor can offer
better performance than the conventional counterpart in most practical
situations, and our design is particularly suited for use with astronomical
adaptive optics systems.
"
How does a single impurity affect the current density in a zigzag graphene nanoribbon?,"  We employ the formalism of bond currents, expressed in terms of the
nonequilibrium Green functions, to image the charge flow between two sites of
the honeycomb lattice of graphene ribbons of few nanometers width. In sharp
contrast to nonrelativistic electrons, current density profiles of quantum
transport at energies close to the Dirac point in clean zigzag graphene
nanoribbons (ZGNR) differs markedly from the profiles of charge density peaked
at the edges due to zero-energy localized edge states. For transport through
the lowest propagating mode induced by these edge states, edge vacancies do not
affect current density peaked in the center of ZGNR. The long-range potential
of a single impurity acts to reduce local current around it while concurrently
increasing the current density along the zigzag edge, so that ZGNR conductance
remains perfect $G=2e^2/h$.
"
What is the tensorial momenta of (p+1)-th rank?,"  We describe D=4 twistorial membrane in terms of two twistorial
three-dimensional world volume fields. We start with the D-dimensional p-brane
generalizations of two phase space string formulations: the one with $p+1$
vectorial fourmomenta, and the second with tensorial momenta of $(p+1)$-th
rank. Further we consider tensionful membrane case in D=4. By using the
membrane generalization of Cartan-Penrose formula we express the fourmomenta by
spinorial fields and obtain the intermediate spinor-space-time formulation.
Further by expressing the worldvolume dreibein and the membrane space-time
coordinate fields in terms of two twistor fields one obtains the purely
twistorial formulation. It appears that the action is generated by a geometric
three-form on two-twistor space. Finally we comment on higher-dimensional (D>4)
twistorial p-brane models and their superextensions.
"
What is the inverse scattering problem associated with interacting modes in one-dimensional structures?,"  We consider the inverse scattering problem associated with any number of
interacting modes in one-dimensional structures. The coupling between the modes
is contradirectional in addition to codirectional, and may be distributed
continuously or in discrete points. The local coupling as a function of
position is obtained from reflection data using a layer-stripping type method,
and the separate identification of the contradirectional and codirectional
coupling is obtained using matrix factorization. Ambiguities are discussed in
detail, and different {\it a priori} information that can resolve the
ambiguities is suggested. The method is exemplified by applications to
multimode optical waveguides with quasi-periodical perturbations.
"
What is the photon-photon collision mode at the ILC that can detect the graviton signal?,"  We investigate the process \rreeG at the future International Linear
Collider(ILC), where G_n is the Kaluza-Klein graviton in the Large Extra
Dimension Model. When the fundamental energy scale is of a few ${\rm TeV}$, the
cross section of this process can reach several hundred fb at a photon-photon
collider with $\sqrt{s}=500 \sim 1000 GeV$, and the cross section in J=2
polarized photon collision mode is much larger than that in J=0 polarized
photon collision mode. We present strategies to distinguish the graviton signal
from numerous SM backgrounds, and find that the graviton signal with extra
dimensions $\delta=3$ can be detected when ${\rm M_S} \le 2.67(1.40) {\rm TeV}$
and $\gamma \gamma$ c.m.s. energy $\sqrt{s}=1000(500) {\rm GeV}$ in unpolarized
photon collision mode, while the detecting upper limit can be increased to
2.79(1.44) ${\rm TeV}$ in $+ -$ ($\lambda_1=1$, $\lambda_2=-1$) polarized
photon collision mode(with photon polarization efficiency $P_{\gamma}=0.9$).
"
What is the index theory used to achieve a generalization of the Kolmogorov's construction?,"  In this paper we consider a semigroup of completely positive maps
$\tau=(\tau_t,t \ge 0)$ with a faithful normal invariant state $\phi$ on a
type-$II_1$ factor $\cla_0$ and propose an index theory. We :achieve this via a
more general Kolmogorov's type of construction for stationary Markov processes
which naturally associate a nested isomorphic von-Neumann algebras. In
particular this construction generalizes well known Jones construction
associated with a sub-factor of type-II$_1$ factor.
"
What are the implications of a Hartogs domain with strongly pseudoconvex boundary for the metric $g_F$?,"  An $n$-dimensional Hartogs domain $D_F$ with strongly pseudoconvex boundary
can be equipped with a natural \K metric $g_F$. In this paper we prove that if
$g_F$ is an extremal \K metric then $(D_F, g_F)$ is biholomorphically isometric
to the $n$-dimensional complex hyperbolic space.
"
What are the Cantor spectrum of measure zero and pure singular continuous for Lebesgue almost all points of the interval?,"  It is shown that Schroedinger operators, with potentials along the shift
embedding of Lebesgue almost every interval exchange transformations, have
Cantor spectrum of measure zero and pure singular continuous for Lebesgue
almost all points of the interval.
"
What are the structural parameters of graphite and potassium-intercalated graphite studied by vdW-DF?,"  Potassium intercalation in graphite is investigated by first-principles
theory. The bonding in the potassium-graphite compound is reasonably well
accounted for by traditional semilocal density functional theory (DFT)
calculations. However, to investigate the intercalate formation energy from
pure potassium atoms and graphite requires use of a description of the graphite
interlayer binding and thus a consistent account of the nonlocal dispersive
interactions. This is included seamlessly with ordinary DFT by a van der Waals
density functional (vdW-DF) approach [Phys. Rev. Lett. 92, 246401 (2004)]. The
use of the vdW-DF is found to stabilize the graphite crystal, with crystal
parameters in fair agreement with experiments. For graphite and
potassium-intercalated graphite structural parameters such as binding
separation, layer binding energy, formation energy, and bulk modulus are
reported. Also the adsorption and sub-surface potassium absorption energies are
reported. The vdW-DF description, compared with the traditional semilocal
approach, is found to weakly soften the elastic response.
"
What is the mass of the top quark determined from the likelihood fit incorporating reconstructed mass distributions?,"  We report the measurements of the t anti-t production cross section and of
the top quark mass using 1.02 fb^-1 of p anti-p data collected with the CDFII
detector at the Fermilab Tevatron. We select events with six or more jets on
which a number of kinematical requirements are imposed by means of a neural
network algorithm. At least one of these jets must be identified as initiated
by a b-quark candidate by the reconstruction of a secondary vertex. The cross
section is measured to be sigma_{tt}=8.3+-1.0(stat.)+2.0-1.5(syst.)+-0.5(lumi.)
pb, which is consistent with the standard model prediction. The top quark mass
of 174.0+-2.2(stat.)+-4.8(syst.) GeV/c^2 is derived from a likelihood fit
incorporating reconstructed mass distributions representative of signal and
background.
"
What are the implications of the concept of classical information in quantum theory?,"  Quantum, in contrast to classical, information theory, allows for different
incompatible types (or species) of information which cannot be combined with
each other. Distinguishing these incompatible types is useful in understanding
the role of the two classical bits in teleportation (or one bit in one-bit
teleportation), for discussing decoherence in information-theoretic terms, and
for giving a proper definition, in quantum terms, of ``classical information.''
Various examples (some updating earlier work) are given of theorems which
relate different incompatible kinds of information, and thus have no
counterparts in classical information theory.
"
What is the effective threshold velocity of the proton for the stopping power?,"  Using time-dependent density-functional theory we calculate from first
principles the rate of energy transfer from a moving proton or antiproton to
the electrons of an insulating material, LiF. The behavior of the electronic
stopping power versus projectile velocity displays an effective threshold
velocity of ~0.2 a.u. for the proton, consistent with recent experimental
observations, and also for the antiproton. The calculated proton/antiproton
stopping-power ratio is ~2.4 at velocities slightly above the threshold (v~0.4
a.u.), as compared to the experimental value of 2.1. The projectile energy loss
mechanism is observed to be stationary and extremely local.
"
What is the Standard Model Higgs boson in the mass range 120 ~< M_H ~< 600 GeV/c^2?,"  The inclusive search for the Standard Model Higgs boson in four-lepton final
states with the ATLAS and CMS detectors at the LHC pp collider is presented.
The discussion focusses on the H-> ZZ^(*)->4l+X decay mode for a Higgs boson in
the mass range 120 ~< M_H ~< 600 GeV/c^2. A prospective analysis is presented
for the discovery potential based on a detailled simulation of the detector
response in the experimental conditions of the first years of LHC running at
low luminosity. An overview of the expected sensitivity in the measurement of
the Higgs boson properties is also given.
"
What are the saturated magnetic moments of CeO2 and Al2O3 nanoparticles?,"  Room-temperature ferromagnetism has been observed in the nanoparticles (7 -
30 nm dia) of nonmagnetic oxides such as CeO2, Al2O3, ZnO, In2O3 and SnO2. The
saturated magnetic moments in CeO_2 and Al_2O_3 nanoparticles are comparable to
those observed in transition metal doped wide band semiconducting oxides. The
other oxide nanoparticles show somewhat lower values of magnetization but with
a clear hysteretic behavior. Conversely, the bulk samples obtained by sintering
the nanoparticles at high temperatures in air or oxygen became diamagnetic. As
there were no magnetic impurities present, we assume that the origin of
ferromagnetism may be due to the exchange interactions between localized
electron spin moments resulting from oxygen vacancies at the surfaces of
nanoparticles. We suggest that ferromagnetism may be a universal characteristic
of nanopartilces of metal oxides
"
What is the relationship between the Kibble-Zurek picture of spontaneous defect formation and the Josephson junction?,"  We report on the spontaneous production of fluxons in the presence of a
symmetry-breaking magnetic field for annular Josephson tunnel junctions during
a thermal quench. The dependence on field intensity $B$ of the probability
$\bar{f_1}$ to trap a single defect during the N-S phase transition drastically
depends on the sample circumferences. We show that the data can be understood
in the framework of the Kibble-Zurek picture of spontaneous defect formation
controlled by causal bounds.
"
What is the necessary condition for the existence of a holomorphic-interpolation of the spectral unit ball in the complex plane?,"  We present several results associated to a holomorphic-interpolation problem
for the spectral unit ball \Omega_n, n\geq 2. We begin by showing that a known
necessary condition for the existence of a
$\mathcal{O}(D;\Omega_n)$-interpolant (D here being the unit disc in the
complex plane), given that the matricial data are non-derogatory, is not
sufficient. We provide next a new necessary condition for the solvability of
the two-point interpolation problem -- one which is not restricted only to
non-derogatory data, and which incorporates the Jordan structure of the
prescribed data. We then use some of the ideas used in deducing the latter
result to prove a Schwarz-type lemma for holomorphic self-maps of \Omega_n,
n\geq 2.
"
What are the advances in the research of the maximum number of triangles that can be obtained in a simple arrangement of n lines or pseudo-lines?,"  We give some new advances in the research of the maximum number of triangles
that we may obtain in a simple arrangements of n lines or pseudo-lines.
"
What are the differential and integral mass formulas for the first law of thermodynamics for asymptotic flat spacetimes?,"  In this paper we will show that using the cosmological constant as a new
thermodynamical state variable, the differential and integral mass formulas of
the first law of thermodynamics for asymptotic flat spacetimes can be extended
to (2+1) dimensional charged BTZ black holes and charged de Sitter space.
"
What is the Wide Field Spectrograph (WiFeS) used to deliver excellent throughput and wide spectral coverage?,"  This paper describes the Wide Field Spectrograph (WiFeS) under construction
at the Research School of Astronomy and Astrophysics (RSAA) of the Australian
National University (ANU) for the ANU 2.3m telescope at the Siding Spring
Observatory. WiFeS is a powerful integral field, double-beam, concentric,
image-slicing spectrograph designed to deliver excellent thoughput, wavelength
stability, spectrophotometric performance and superb image quality along with
wide spectral coverage throughout the 320-950 nm wavelength region. It provides
a 25x38 arcsec. field with 0.5 arcsec. sampling along each of twenty five 38X1
arcsec slitlets. The output format is optimized to match the 4096x4096 pixel
CCD detectors in each of two cameras individually optimized for the blue and
the red ends of the spectrum, respectively. A process of ""interleaved
nod-and-shuffle"" will be applied to permit quantum noise-limited sky
subtraction. Using VPH gratings, spectral resolutions of 3000 and 7000 are
provided. The full spectral range is covered in a single exposure at R=3000,
and in two exposures in the R=7000 mode. The use of transmissive coated optics,
VPH gratings and optimized mirror coatings ensures a throughput (including
telescope atmosphere and detector) > 30% over a wide spectral range. The
concentric image-slicer design ensures an excellent and uniform image quality
across the full field. To maximize scientific return, the whole instrument is
configured for remote observing, pipeline data reduction, and the accumulation
of calibration image libraries.

What are the areas and volumes of geodesic spheres and balls determined by the Jacobi vector fields?,"  In this paper a method for the resolution of the differential equation of the
Jacobi vector fields in the manifold V1 = Sp(2)/SU(2) is exposed. These results
are applied to determine areas and volumes of geodesic spheres and balls.

What are the implications of the vibrationally-excited water maser line at 658 GHz (455 micron) for the commissioning phase of the Submillimeter Array (SMA) interferometer?,"  Discovered in 1995 at the Caltech Submillimeter Observatory (CSO), the
vibrationally-excited water maser line at 658 GHz (455 micron) is seen in
oxygen-rich giant and supergiant stars. Because this maser can be so strong (up
to thousands of Janskys), it was very helpful during the commissioning phase of
the highest frequency band (620-700 GHz) of the Submillimeter Array (SMA)
interferometer. From late 2002 to early 2006, brief attempts were made to
search for emission from additional sources beyond the original CSO survey.
These efforts have expanded the source count from 10 to 16. The maser emission
appears to be quite compact spatially, as expected from theoretical
considerations; thus these objects can potentially be used as atmospheric phase
calibrators. Many of these objects also exhibit maser emission in the
vibrationally-excited SiO maser at 215 GHz. Because both maser lines likely
originate from a similar physical region, these objects can be used to test
techniques of phase transfer calibration between millimeter and submillimeter
bands. The 658 GHz masers will be important beacons to assess the performance
of the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) in this challenging high-frequency
band.
"
What are the implications of phase space constraints for neutrinos in ultra energetic sources?,"  While the importance of phase space constraints for gravitational clustering
of neutrinos (which are fermions) is well recognized, the explicit use of such
constraints to limit neutrino emission from ultra energetic sources has not
been stressed. Special and general relativistic phase space constraints are
shown to limit neutrino luminosities in compact sources in various situations.
"
What is the optimal limiting magnitude K_min for the 2MASS survey to exclude from the calculation of the flux dipole?,"  A comparison of the 2MASS flux dipole to the CMB dipole can serve as a method
to constrain a combination of the cosmological parameter Omega_m and the
luminosity bias of the 2MASS survey. For this constraint to be as tight as
possible, it is necessary to maximize the correlation between the two dipoles.
This can be achieved by optimizing the survey window through which the flux
dipole is measured. Here we explicitly construct such a window for the 2MASS
survey. The optimization in essence reduces to excluding from the calculation
of the flux dipole galaxies brighter than some limiting magnitude K_min of the
near-infrared K_s band. This exclusion mitigates nonlinear effects and shot
noise from small scales, which decorrelate the 2MASS dipole from the CMB
dipole. Under the assumption of negligible shot noise we find that the optimal
value of K_min is about five. Inclusion of shot noise shifts the optimal K_min
to larger values. We present an analytical formula for shot noise for the 2MASS
flux dipole, to be used in follow-up work with 2MASS data.
  The misalignment angle between the two dipoles is a sensitive measure of
their correlation: the higher the correlation, the smaller the expectation
value of the angle. A minimum of the misalignment is thus a sign of the optimal
gravity window. We model analytically the distribution function for the
misalignment angle and show that the misalignment estimated by Maller et al. is
consistent with the assumed underlying model (though it is greater than the
expectation value). We predict with about 90% confidence that the misalignment
will decrease if 2MASS galaxies brighter than K_min = 5 mag are excluded from
the calculation of the flux dipole. This prediction has been indirectly
confirmed by the results of Erdogdu et al. (ABRIDGED)
"
What are the consequences of the off mass-shell effects on the energy loss process in the parton recombination scenario?,"  We study the collisional energy loss mechanism for particles produced off
mass-shell in a finite size QCD medium. The off mass-shell effects introduced
are to consider particles produced in wave packets instead of plane waves and
the length scale associated to an in-medium particles' life-time. We show that
these effects reduce the energy loss as compared to the case when the particles
are described as freely propagating from the source. The reduction of the
energy loss is stronger as this scale becomes of the order or smaller than the
medium size. We discuss possible consequences of the result on the description
of the energy loss process in the parton recombination scenario.
"
What are the two types of hydrodynamic instabilities that play a role during the postbounce accretion phase of collapsing stellar cores?,"  By 2D hydrodynamic simulations including a detailed equation of state and
neutrino transport, we investigate the interplay between different non-radial
hydrodynamic instabilities that play a role during the postbounce accretion
phase of collapsing stellar cores. The convective mode of instability, which is
driven by negative entropy gradients caused by neutrino heating or by time
variations of the shock strength, can be identified clearly by the development
of typical Rayleigh-Taylor mushrooms. However, in cases where the gas in the
postshock region is rapidly advected towards the gain radius, the growth of
such a buoyancy instability can be suppressed. In such a situation the shocked
flow nevertheless can develop non-radial asymmetry with an oscillatory growth
of the amplitude. This phenomenon has been termed ``standing accretion shock
instability'' (SASI). It is shown here that the SASI oscillations can trigger
convective instability and like the latter they lead to an increase of the
average shock radius and of the mass in the gain layer. Both hydrodynamic
instabilities in combination stretch the advection time of matter through the
neutrino-heating layer and thus enhance the neutrino energy deposition in
support of the neutrino-driven explosion mechanism. A rapidly contracting and
more compact nascent NS turns out to be favorable for explosions, because the
accretion luminosity and neutrino heating are larger and the growth rate of the
SASI is higher. Moreover, we show that the oscillation period of the SASI and a
variety of other features in our simulations agree with estimates for the
advective-acoustic cycle (AAC), in which perturbations are carried by the
accretion flow from the shock to the neutron star and pressure waves close an
amplifying global feedback loop. (abridged)
"
What are the properties of a $J$-class operator?,"  We provide a characterization of $J$-class and $J^{mix}$-class unilateral
weighted shifts on $l^{\infty}(\mathbb{N})$ in terms of their weight sequences.
In contrast to the previously mentioned result we show that a bilateral
weighted shift on $l^{\infty}(\mathbb{Z})$ cannot be a $J$-class operator.
"
What is the relationship between the Curie temperature and the fluence in the graphite samples?,"  We have prepared magnetic graphite samples bombarded by protons at low
temperatures and low fluences to attenuate the large thermal annealing produced
during irradiation. An overall optimization of sample handling allowed us to
find Curie temperatures $ T_c \gtrsim 350$ K at the used fluences. The
magnetization versus temperature shows unequivocally a linear dependence, which
can be interpreted as due to excitations of spin waves in a two dimensional
Heisenberg model with a weak uniaxial anisotropy.
"
What is the dynamical condition for percolation on a graph G when it is a tree?,"  H\""aggstr\""om, Peres, and Steif (1997) have introduced a dynamical version of
percolation on a graph $G$. When $G$ is a tree they derived a necessary and
sufficient condition for percolation to exist at some time $t$. In the case
that $G$ is a spherically symmetric tree, H\""aggstr\""om, Peres, and Steif
(1997) derived a necessary and sufficient condition for percolation to exist at
some time $t$ in a given target set $D$. The main result of the present paper
is a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of percolation, at
some time $t\in D$, in the case that the underlying tree is not necessary
spherically symmetric. This answers a question of Yuval Peres (personal
communication). We present also a formula for the Hausdorff dimension of the
set of exceptional times of percolation.
"
What are the key concepts in the current standard model of the evolution of the Universe?,"  We review the current standard model for the evolution of the Universe from
an early inflationary epoch to the complex hierarchy of structure seen today.
We summarize and provide key references for the following topics: observations
of the expanding Universe; the hot early Universe and nucleosynthesis; theory
and observations of the cosmic microwave background; Big Bang cosmology;
inflation; dark matter and dark energy; theory of structure formation; the cold
dark matter model; galaxy formation; cosmological simulations; observations of
galaxies, clusters, and quasars; statistical measures of large-scale structure;
and measurement of cosmological parameters. We conclude with discussion of some
open questions in cosmology. This review is designed to provide a graduate
student or other new worker in the field an introduction to the cosmological
literature.
"
What is the evidence for the low energy absorber in the XMM-Newton observation of the QSO 2MASS 0918+2117?,"  When observed by XMM-Newton in 2003 the type 1 QSO 2MASS 0918+2117 was found
to in a low flux state, some ~4-5 times fainter than during an earlier Chandra
observation. The 2-6 keV spectrum was unusually hard, with evidence for a
reflection-dominated continuum, while a soft excess prevented confirmation of
the anticipated low energy absorber. In a second XMM-Newton observation in
2005, the X-ray flux is found to have recovered, with a 2-10 keV continuum
slope now typical of broad-line active galaxy, and clear evidence for low
energy absorption. We find the preferred ionisation state of the absorbing gas
to be low, consistent with the red nucleus and strong optical polarisation of
2MASS 0918+2117. A residual soft excess is of similar spectral form and flux to
that seen in 2003.
"
What are the languages with various degrees of decomposability between undecomposable and perfectly decomposable?,"  A study of assisted problem solving formalized via decompositions of
deterministic finite automata is initiated. The landscape of new types of
decompositions of finite automata this study uncovered is presented. Languages
with various degrees of decomposability between undecomposable and perfectly
decomposable are shown to exist.
"
What are the implications of the confinement of QCD in terms of glueball spectra?,"  This paper is a continuation of ArXiv:0707.1324 where improved holographic
theories for QCD were set up and explored. Here, the IR confining geometries
are classified and analyzed. They all end in a ""good"" (repulsive) singularity
in the IR. The glueball spectra are gaped and discrete, and they favorably
compare to the lattice data. Quite generally, confinement and discrete spectra
imply each other. Asymptotically linear glueball masses can also be achieved.
Asymptotic mass ratios of various glueballs with different spin also turn out
to be universal. Mesons dynamics is implemented via space filling D4-anti-D4
brane pairs. The associated tachyon dynamics is analyzed and chiral symmetry
breaking is shown. The dynamics of the RR axion is analyzed, and the
non-perturbative running of the QCD theta-angle is obtained. It is shown to
always vanish in the IR.
"
What is the relationship between the curvature of a Riemannian manifold and its diffeomorphic to a space form?,"  We show that a compact Riemannian manifold with weakly 1/4-pinched sectional
curvatures is either locally symmetric or diffeomorphic to a space form.
"
What is the moduli space of stable bundles of coherent sheaves?,"  We present a novel notion of stable objects in the derived category of
coherent sheaves on a smooth projective variety. As one application we
compactify a moduli space of stable bundles using genuine complexes.
"
What is the effective 1D equation that governs the axial dynamics of mean-field cigar-shaped condensates?,"  By applying the standard adiabatic approximation and using the accurate
analytical expression for the corresponding local chemical potential obtained
in our previous work [Phys. Rev. A \textbf{75}, 063610 (2007)] we derive an
effective 1D equation that governs the axial dynamics of mean-field
cigar-shaped condensates with repulsive interatomic interactions, accounting
accurately for the contribution from the transverse degrees of freedom. This
equation, which is more simple than previous proposals, is also more accurate.
Moreover, it allows treating condensates containing an axisymmetric vortex with
no additional cost. Our effective equation also has the correct limit in both
the quasi-1D mean-field regime and the Thomas-Fermi regime and permits one to
derive fully analytical expressions for ground-state properties such as the
chemical potential, axial length, axial density profile, and local sound
velocity. These analytical expressions remain valid and accurate in between the
above two extreme regimes. Following the same procedure we also derive an
effective 2D equation that governs the transverse dynamics of mean-field
disk-shaped condensates. This equation, which also has the correct limit in
both the quasi-2D and the Thomas-Fermi regime, is again more simple and
accurate than previous proposals. We have checked the validity of our equations
by numerically solving the full 3D Gross-Pitaevskii equation.
"
What is the Very Large Array (VLA) Low-frequency Sky Survey (VLSS) used for?,"  The Very Large Array (VLA) Low-frequency Sky Survey (VLSS) has imaged 95% of
the 3*pi sr of sky north of declination = -30 degrees at a frequency of 74 MHz
(4 meter wavelength). The resolution is 80"" (FWHM) throughout, and the typical
RMS noise level is ~0.1 Jy/beam. The typical point-source detection limit is
0.7 Jy/beam and so far nearly 70,000 sources have been catalogued. This survey
used the 74 MHz system added to the VLA in 1998. It required new imaging
algorithms to remove the large ionospheric distortions at this very low
frequency throughout the entire ~11.9 degree field of view. This paper
describes the observation and data reduction methods used for the VLSS and
presents the survey images and source catalog. All of the calibrated images and
the source catalog are available online (http://lwa.nrl.navy.mil/VLSS) for use
by the astronomical community.
"
What is the relationship between the Lorentzian lightcone height function and the geometric invariants of the lightcone surface?,"  We define the notions of $S_t^1\times S_s^1$-valued lightcone Gauss maps,
lightcone pedal surface and Lorentzian lightcone height function of Lorentzian
surface in semi-Euclidean 4-space and established the relationships between
singularities of these objects and geometric invariants of the surface as
applications of standard techniques of singularity theory for the Lorentzian
lightcone height function.
"
What are the conditions under which the atomic Bose-Einstein condensate becomes unstable in an elliptical trap?,"  We theoretically examine the rotation of an atomic Bose-Einstein condensate
in an elliptical trap, both in the absence and presence of a quantized vortex.
Two methods of introducing the rotating potential are considered -
adiabatically increasing the rotation frequency at fixed ellipticity, and
adiabatically increasing the trap ellipticity at fixed rotation frequency.
Extensive simulations of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation are employed to map out
the points where the condensate becomes unstable and ultimately forms a vortex
lattice. We highlight the key features of having a quantized vortex in the
initial condensate. In particular, we find that the presence of the vortex
causes the instabilities to shift to lower or higher rotation frequencies,
depending on the direction of the vortex relative to the trap rotation.
"
What are the supersymmetry breaking of the U(1)_R symmetry in the supersymmetric SU(2) x U(1) gauge theory?,"  We consider an N=2 supersymmetric SU(2) \times U(1) gauge theory with N_f=2
massless flavors and a Fayet-Iliopoulos (FI) term. In the presence of the FI
term, supersymmetry is spontaneously broken at tree level (on the Coulomb
branch), leaving a pseudo-flat direction in the classical potential. This
vacuum degeneracy is removed once quantum corrections are taken into account.
Due to the SU(2) gauge dynamics, the effective potential exhibits a local
minimum at the dyon point, where not only supersymmetry but also U(1)_R
symmetry is broken, while a supersymmetric vacuum would be realized toward
infinity with the runaway behavior of the potential. This local minimum is
found to be parametrically long-lived. Interestingly, from a phenomenological
point of view, in this meta-stable vacuum the massive hypermultiplets inherent
in the theory play the role of the messenger fields in the gauge mediation
scenario, when the Standard Model gauge group is embedded into their flavor
symmetry.
"
What are the implications for the simulation of hadronic interactions at ultra-high energy?,"  The Pierre Auger Observatory allows the measurement of both longitudinal
profiles and lateral particle distributions of high-energy showers. The former
trace the overall shower development, mainly of the electromagnetic component
close to the core where the latter reflect the particle densities in the tail
of the shower far away from the core and are sensitive to both the muonic and
electromagnetic components. Combining the two complementary measurements,
predictions of air shower simulations are tested. In particular the muon
component of the tank signals, which is sensitive to hadronic interactions at
high energy, is studied with several independent methods. Implications for the
simulation of hadronic interactions at ultra-high energy are discussed.
"
What is the relationship between two matrices being topologically orbit equivalent if and only if they have isomorphic Cuntz-Krieger algebras?,"  We will prove that one-sided topological Markov shifts $(X_A,\sigma_A)$ and
$(X_B,\sigma_B)$ for matrices $A$ and $B$ with entries in $\{0,1\}$ are
topologically orbit equivalent if and only if there exists an isomorphism
between the Cuntz-Krieger algebras ${\Cal O}_A$ and ${\Cal O}_B$ keeping their
commutative $C^*$-subalgerbas $C(X_A)$ and $C(X_B)$. It is also equivalent to
the condition that there exists a homeomorphism from $X_A$ to $X_B$
intertwining their topological full groups. We will also study structure of the
automorphisms of ${\Cal O}_A$ keeping the commutative $C^*$-algebra $C(X_A)$.
"
What are the extended membrane structures that emerge in a self-organized manner?,"  This article reports about a novel extension of dissipative particle dynamics
(DPD) that allows the study of the collective dynamics of complex chemical and
structural systems in a spatially resolved manner with a combinatorially
complex variety of different system constituents. We show that introducing
multipolar interactions between particles leads to extended membrane structures
emerging in a self-organized manner and exhibiting both the necessary
mechanical stability for transport and fluidity so as to provide a
two-dimensional self-organizing dynamic reaction environment for kinetic
studies in the context of cell biology. We further show that the emergent
dynamics of extended membrane bound objects is in accordance with scaling laws
imposed by physics.
"
What is the role of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes in relation to the Levy and the additive processes?,"  We summarize the relations among three classes of laws: infinitely divisible,
selfdecomposable and stable. First we look at them as the solutions of the
Central Limit Problem; then their role is scrutinized in relation to the Levy
and the additive processes with an emphasis on stationarity and selfsimilarity.
Finally we analyze the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes driven by Levy noises and
their selfdecomposable stationary distributions, and we end with a few
particular examples.
"
What are the classes of local and global models in simulations for the study of the atmospheres of brown dwarfs and extrasolar planets?,"  We discuss prospects of using multi-dimensional time-dependent simulations to
study the atmospheres of brown dwarfs and extrasolar giant planets, including
the processes of convection, radiation, dust formation, and rotation. We argue
that reasonably realistic simulations are feasible, however, separated into two
classes of local and global models. Numerical challenges are related to
potentially large dynamic ranges, and the treatment of scattering of radiation
in multi-D geometries.
"
eta pi^0 gamma in the NJL model?,"  The branching ratios and photon spectra of the rare processes rho(omega)->
pi^0 pi^0 gamma, rho(omega) -> eta pi^0 gamma are calculated in the framework
of the standard local quark Nambu--Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model. Three types of
diagrams are considered: the quark box and the pole diagrams with scalar
(sigma,a_0(980)) and vector (rho,omega) mesons. The obtained estimations for
the widths of the processes rho(omega)-> pi^0 pi^0 gamma are in satisfactory
agreement with existing experimental data. Predictions are made for the widths
of the processes rho(omega) -> eta pi^0 gamma.
"
What are the distinct regions in the phase diagram which are not characterized by any singular behavior?,"  We analyze the Bures metric over the manifold of thermal density matrices for
systems featuring a zero temperature quantum phase transition. We show that the
quantum critical region can be characterized in terms of the temperature
scaling behavior of the metric tensor itself. Furthermore, the analysis of the
metric tensor when both temperature and an external field are varied, allows to
complement the understanding of the phase diagram including cross-over regions
which are not characterized by any singular behavior. These results provide a
further extension of the scope of the metric approach to quantum criticality.
"
What are the characteristics of the Compton cloud (CC) in the context of the analysis of the neutron star candidate source Cyg X-2?,"  Correlations between the quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) and the spectral
power-law index have been reported for a number of black hole candidate sources
and for four neutron star (NS) sources, 4U 0614+09, 4U 1608-52, 4U 1728-34 and
Sco X-1. An examination of QPO frequencies and index relationship in Cyg X-2 is
reported herein. The RXTE spectrum of Cyg X-2 can be adequately represented by
a simple two-component model of Compton up-scattering with a soft photon
electron temperature of about 0.7 keV and an iron K-line. Inferred spectral
power-law index shows correlation with the low QPO frequencies. We find that
the Thomson optical depth of the Compton cloud (CC) tau, in framework of
spherical geometry, is in the range of ~4-6, which is consistent with the
neutron star's surface being obscured. The NS high frequency pulsations are
presumably suppressed as a result of photon scattering off CC electrons because
of such high values of tau. We also point out a number of similarities in terms
timing (presence of low and high frequency QPOs) and spectral (high CC optical
depth and low CC plasma temperature) appearances between Cyg X-2 and Sco X-1.
"
What are the abundances of Ne2+ ions for the winds of each star?,"  We report on neon abundances derived from {\it Spitzer} high resolution
spectral data of eight Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars using the forbidden line of
[\ion{Ne}{3}] 15.56 microns. Our targets include four WN stars of subtypes
4--7, and four WC stars of subtypes 4--7. We derive ion fraction abundances
$\gamma$ of Ne^{2+} for the winds of each star. The ion fraction abundance is a
product of the ionization fraction $Q_{\rm i}$ in stage i and the abundance by
number ${\cal A}_E$ of element E relative to all nuclei. Values generally
consistent with solar are obtained for the WN stars, and values in excess of
solar are obtained for the WC stars.
"
What is the relationship between the halo concentration and the halo mass?,"  Several recent studies suggest a correlation between dark matter halo mass
and the shape of the density profile. We re-analyze simulations from Ricotti
(2003) in which such a correlation was proposed. We use a standard analysis of
the halo density profiles and compare the old simulations to new ones performed
with Gadget2, including higher resolution runs. We confirm Ricotti's result
that, at virialization, the central log slopes alpha, at 5%-10% of the virial
radius are correlated with the halo mass and that the halo concentration is a
universal constant. Our results do not contradict the majority of published
papers: when using a split power law to fit the density profiles, due to the
alpha-concentration degeneracy, the fits are consistent with halos having a
universal shape with alpha=1 or 1.5 and concentrations that depend on the mass,
in agreement with results published elsewhere.
  Recently, several groups have found no evidence for convergence of the inner
halo profile to a constant power law. The choice of a split power law
parameterization used in this letter is motivated by the need to compare our
results to previous ones and is formally valid because we are not able to
resolve regions where the slope of the fitting function reaches its asymptotic
constant value. Using a non-parameterized technique, we also show that the
density profiles of dwarf galaxies at z ~ 10 have a log slope shallower than
0.5 within 5% of the virial radius.
"
What are the three channels of the Infrared Camera (IRC)?,"  The Infrared Camera (IRC) is one of two focal-plane instruments on the AKARI
satellite. It is designed for wide-field deep imaging and low-resolution
spectroscopy in the near- to mid-infrared (1.8--26.5um) in the pointed
observation mode of AKARI. IRC is also operated in the survey mode to make an
all-sky survey at 9 and 18um. It comprises three channels. The NIR channel
(1.8--5.5um) employs a 512 x 412 InSb array, whereas both the MIR-S
(4.6--13.4um) and MIR-L (12.6--26.5um) channels use 256 x 256 Si:As impurity
band conduction arrays. Each of the three channels has a field-of-view of about
10' x 10' and are operated simultaneously. The NIR and MIR-S share the same
field-of-view by virtue of a beam splitter. The MIR-L observes the sky about
$25' away from the NIR/MIR-S field-of-view. IRC gives us deep insights into the
formation and evolution of galaxies, the evolution of planetary disks, the
process of star-formation, the properties of interstellar matter under various
physical conditions, and the nature and evolution of solar system objects. The
in-flight performance of IRC has been confirmed to be in agreement with the
pre-flight expectation. This paper summarizes the design and the in-flight
operation and imaging performance of IRC.
"
What is the time-discrete evolution equation for arbitrary closed polygons?,"  Modelling incompressible ideal fluids as a finite collection of vortex
filaments is important in physics (super-fluidity, models for the onset of
turbulence) as well as for numerical algorithms used in computer graphics for
the real time simulation of smoke. Here we introduce a time-discrete evolution
equation for arbitrary closed polygons in 3-space that is a discretisation of
the localised induction approximation of filament motion. This discretisation
shares with its continuum limit the property that it is a completely integrable
system. We apply this polygon evolution to a significant improvement of the
numerical algorithms used in Computer Graphics.
"
What is the experiment setup used to study the exclusive electroproduction of pi+ mesons?,"  The exclusive electroproduction of pi+ mesons was studied with the Hermes
spectrometer at the DESY laboratory by scattering 27.6 GeV positron and
electron beams off an internal hydrogen gas target. The virtual-photon cross
sections were measured as a function of the Mandelstam variable t and the
squared four momentum -Q^2 of the exchanged virtual photon. A model calculation
based on Generalized Parton Distributions is in fair agreement with the data at
low values of |t| if power corrections are included. A model calculation based
on the Regge formalism gives a good description of the magnitude and the t and
Q^2 dependences of the cross section.
"
What are the key concepts in a differential field extension?,"  A Galois theory of differential fields with parameters is developed in a
manner that generalizes Kolchin's theory. It is shown that all connected
differential algebraic groups are Galois groups of some appropriate
differential field extension.
"
What is the LOFF phase in the phase structure of two-color and two-flavor QCD?,"  We explore the phase structure of two-color and two-flavor QCD in the space
of the quark chemical potential \mu_q and the isospin chemical potential \mu_I.
Using a mean-field model we calculate the chiral and diquark condensates,
\sigma and \Delta, self-consistently. In weak coupling and in the chiral limit,
we confirm the interval of the isospin chemical potential,
0.71\Delta_0<\mu_I<0.75\Delta_0, in which a single plane-wave
Larkin-Ovchinnikov-Fulde-Ferrell (LOFF) phase is favored over isotropic
superfluidity and normal quark matter. The LOFF window becomes slightly wider
at high density. For stronger coupling with nonzero quark mass, which is
relevant to currently available numerical simulations in lattice two-color QCD,
the single plane-wave LOFF phase appears only at sufficiently high density. The
prediction obtained for the LOFF region could be tested with lattice since we
can prove that the present system is free from the fermion sign problem. We
draw the energy landscape on which local minima corresponding to the isotropic
superfluid phase and the LOFF phase and a local maximum corresponding to the
gapless phase are manifest. Our results clearly illustrate the path from the
the unstable gapless phase down to the LOFF phase.
"
How do the editions differ from one another?,"  From a census of forty copies, we can distinguish three different editions of
von Staudt's Geometrie der Lage: the first of 1847 and two undated ones from
the 1870's.
"
What is the complexity of the maximum weighted edge biclique problem when the edge weights come from a specific set S?,"  Given a bipartite graph $G = (V_1,V_2,E)$ where edges take on {\it both}
positive and negative weights from set $\mathcal{S}$, the {\it maximum weighted
edge biclique} problem, or $\mathcal{S}$-MWEB for short, asks to find a
bipartite subgraph whose sum of edge weights is maximized. This problem has
various applications in bioinformatics, machine learning and databases and its
(in)approximability remains open. In this paper, we show that for a wide range
of choices of $\mathcal{S}$, specifically when $| \frac{\min\mathcal{S}} {\max
\mathcal{S}} | \in \Omega(\eta^{\delta-1/2}) \cap O(\eta^{1/2-\delta})$ (where
$\eta = \max\{|V_1|, |V_2|\}$, and $\delta \in (0,1/2]$), no polynomial time
algorithm can approximate $\mathcal{S}$-MWEB within a factor of $n^{\epsilon}$
for some $\epsilon > 0$ unless $\mathsf{RP = NP}$. This hardness result gives
justification of the heuristic approaches adopted for various applied problems
in the aforementioned areas, and indicates that good approximation algorithms
are unlikely to exist. Specifically, we give two applications by showing that:
1) finding statistically significant biclusters in the SAMBA model, proposed in
\cite{Tan02} for the analysis of microarray data, is
$n^{\epsilon}$-inapproximable; and 2) no polynomial time algorithm exists for
the Minimum Description Length with Holes problem \cite{Bu05} unless
$\mathsf{RP=NP}$.
"
What is the relationship between the splitting of the vortices in the cuprates into fractional vortices and the interpretation that the observed splitting is of static rather than dynamic origin?,"  We propose that the observed splitting of the vortices in the cuprates into
fractional vortices (partons) may be of static rather than of dynamic origin.
This interpretation is backed by a study of a model with a dominant d-wave and
subdominant s-wave pairing interaction. We find that the vortex may split into
two partons, both of which carry one half of the magnetic flux quantum. The
partons are hold together by a confining string along which the phase jumps
approximately by pi and their equilibrium distance increases with lowering the
energy difference epsilon between the pairing states. The partons become
deconfined at the critical point where epsilon vanishes.
"
What are the implications of the constraints on the amplitude and the length scale of the modified gravity in the context of the modified Newtonian model?,"  We explore observational constraints on possible deviations from Newtonian
gravity by means of large-scale clustering of galaxies. We measure the power
spectrum and the bispectrum of Sloan Digital Sky Survey galaxies and compare
the result with predictions in an empirical model of modified gravity. Our
model assumes an additional Yukawa-like term with two parameters that
characterize the amplitude and the length scale of the modified gravity. The
model predictions are calculated using two methods; the second-order
perturbation theory and direct N-body simulations. These methods allow us to
study non-linear evolution of large-scale structure. Using the simulation
results, we find that perturbation theory provides reliable estimates for the
power spectrum and the bispectrum in the modified Newtonian model. We also
construct mock galaxy catalogues from the simulations, and derive constraints
on the amplitude and the length scale of deviations from Newtonian gravity. The
resulting constraints from power spectrum are consistent with those obtained in
our earlier work, indicating the validity of the previous empirical modeling of
gravitational nonlinearity in the modified Newtonian model. If linear biasing
is adopted, the bispectrum of the SDSS galaxies yields constraints very similar
to those from the power spectrum. If we allow for the nonlinear biasing
instead, we find that the ratio of the quadratic to linear biasing
coefficients, b_2/b_1, should satisfy -0.4 < b_2/b_1<0.3 in the modified
Newtonian model.

What are the implications of the Curie temperature and the magnetization in the Mo-doped perovskite La0.7Ca0.3Mn1-xMoxO3?,"  The structure, electronic, and magnetic properties of the Mo-doped perovskite
La0.7Ca0.3Mn1-xMoxO3 (x < 0.1) have been studied. A significant increase in
resistivity and lattice parameters were observed with Mo doping. A marginal
decrease in the Curie temperature Tc and the associated metal-insulator
transition Tp were observed. Magnetization data reveal that long-range
ferromagnetic ordering persists in all samples studied and the saturation
moment decreases linearly as x increases. Enhancement in magnetoresistance at
near Tc in the Mo-doped compounds with an optimum doping value x = 0.05 was
observed. The overall experimental results can be explained by considering the
induced Mn2+ ions with Mo6+ in the Mo-doped systems, with the strong FM
coupling between Mn4+/2+- O - Mn3+.
"
What are the implications of entanglement in a pair of molecular ensembles in a superconducting resonator?,"  We study the dynamics of a pair of molecular ensembles trapped inside a
superconducting resonator through which they are strongly coupled via a
microwave field mode. We find that entanglement can be generated via ""vacuum
fluctuations"" even when the molecules and cavity field are initially prepared
in their ground state. This entanglement is created in a relatively short time
and without the need for further manipulation of the system. It does,
therefore, provide a convenient scheme to entangle two mesoscopic systems, and
may well be useful quantum information processing.
"
What are the asymptotic formula for the summatory function of the divisor function d_k(n) when k >= 2?,"  We provide upper bounds for the mean square integral $$
\int_X^{2X}(\Delta_k(x+h) - \Delta_k(x))^2 dx \qquad(h = h(X)\gg1, h = o(x)
{\roman{as}} X\to\infty) $$ where $h$ lies in a suitable range. For $k\ge2$ a
fixed integer, $\Delta_k(x)$ is the error term in the asymptotic formula for
the summatory function of the divisor function $d_k(n)$, generated by
$\zeta^k(s)$.
"
What are the different types of attractors in the co-evolution of producers and customers?,"  We study the dynamics of co-evolution of producers and customers described by
bit-strings representing individual traits. Individual ''size-like'' properties
are controlled by binary encounters which outcome depends upon a recognition
process. Depending upon the parameter set-up, mutual selection of producers and
customers results in different types of attractors, either an exclusive niches
regime or a competition regime.
"
What is the method to compute the Casimir energy between arbitrary compact objects?,"  We develop an exact method for computing the Casimir energy between arbitrary
compact objects, either dielectrics or perfect conductors. The energy is
obtained as an interaction between multipoles, generated by quantum current
fluctuations. The objects' shape and composition enter only through their
scattering matrices. The result is exact when all multipoles are included, and
converges rapidly. A low frequency expansion yields the energy as a series in
the ratio of the objects' size to their separation. As an example, we obtain
this series for two dielectric spheres and the full interaction at all
separations for perfectly conducting spheres.
"
What are the decoherence mechanisms in the dynamics of electron and hole spins in single and double quantum dots?,"  In this article we review our work on the dynamics and decoherence of
electron and hole spins in single and double quantum dots. The first part, on
electron spins, focuses on decoherence induced via the hyperfine interaction
while the second part covers decoherence and relaxation of heavy-hole spins due
to spin-orbit interaction as well as the manipulation of heavy-hole spin using
electric dipole spin resonance.
"
What are the two-sided sharp estimates for the Green function of a half-space of the relativistic α-stable process?,"  The purpose of this paper is to find optimal estimates for the Green function
of a half-space of {\it the relativistic $\alpha$-stable process} with
parameter $m$ on $\Rd$ space. This process has an infinitesimal generator of
the form $mI-(m^{2/\alpha}I-\Delta)^{\alpha/2},$ where $0<\alpha<2$, $m>0$, and
reduces to the isotropic $\alpha$-stable process for $m=0$. Its potential
theory for open bounded sets has been well developed throughout the recent
years however almost nothing was known about the behaviour of the process on
unbounded sets. The present paper is intended to fill this gap and we provide
two-sided sharp estimates for the Green function for a half-space. As a
byproduct we obtain some improvements of the estimates known for bounded sets
specially for balls. The advantage of these estimates is a clarification of the
relationship between the diameter of the ball and the parameter $m$ of the
process.
  The main result states that the Green function is comparable with the Green
function for the Brownian motion if the points are away from the boundary of a
half-space and their distance is greater than one. On the other hand for the
remaining points the Green function is somehow related the Green function for
the isotropic $\alpha$-stable process. For example, for $d\ge3$, it is
comparable with the Green function for the isotropic $\alpha$-stable process,
provided that the points are close enough.
"
What are the advantages of the Genetic Algorithm in image registration?,"  This paper investigates the use of evolutionary optimisation techniques to
register a template with a scene image. An error function is created to measure
the correspondence of the template to the image. The problem presented here is
to optimise the horizontal, vertical and scaling parameters that register the
template with the scene. The Genetic Algorithm, Simulated Annealing and
Particle Swarm Optimisations are compared to a Nelder-Mead Simplex optimisation
with starting points chosen in a pre-processing stage. The paper investigates
the precision and accuracy of each method and shows that all four methods
perform favourably for image registration. SA is the most precise, GA is the
most accurate. PSO is a good mix of both and the Simplex method returns local
minima the most. A pre-processing stage should be investigated for the
evolutionary methods in order to improve performance. Discrete versions of the
optimisation methods should be investigated to further improve computational
performance.
"
What is the scaling function for the two-point spin correlator in the Ising-anisotropic Bose-Fermi Kondo model?,"  We consider the finite temperature scaling properties of a Kondo-destroying
quantum critical point in the Ising-anisotropic Bose-Fermi Kondo model (BFKM).
A cluster-updating Monte Carlo approach is used, in order to reliably access a
wide temperature range. The scaling function for the two-point spin correlator
is found to have the form dictated by a boundary conformal field theory, even
though the underlying Hamiltonian lacks conformal invariance. Similar
conclusions are reached for all multi-point correlators of the spin-isotropic
BFKM in a dynamical large-N limit. Our results suggest that the quantum
critical local properties of the sub-ohmic BFKM are those of an underlying
boundary conformal field theory.
"
What is the problem of distilling local pure states from mixed ones in the context of quantum information?,"  Local pure states are an important resource for quantum computing. The
problem of distilling local pure states from mixed ones can be cast in an
information theoretic paradigm. The bipartite version of this problem where
local purity must be distilled from an arbitrary quantum state shared between
two parties, Alice and Bob, is closely related to the problem of separating
quantum and classical correlations in the state and in particular, to a measure
of classical correlations called the one-way distillable common randomness. In
Phys. Rev. A 71, 062303 (2005), the optimal rate of local purity distillation
is derived when many copies of a bipartite quantum state are shared between
Alice and Bob, and the parties are allowed unlimited use of a unidirectional
dephasing channel. In the present paper, we extend this result to the setting
in which the use of the channel is bounded. We demonstrate that in the case of
a classical-quantum system, the expression for the local purity distilled is
efficiently computable and provide examples with their tradeoff curves.
"
What is the effect of the Zeeman splitting on the electronic trapping in the quantum dot?,"  We analyze the charge and spin dynamics in a DC biased double quantum dot
driven by crossed DC and AC magnetic fields. In this configuration, spatial
delocalization due to inter-dot tunnel competes with intra-dot spin rotations
induced by the time dependent magnetic field, giving rise to a complicated time
dependent behavior of the tunnelling current. When the Zeeman splitting has the
same value in both dots and spin flip is negligible, the electrons remain in
the triplet subspace (dark subspace) performing coherent spin rotations and the
current does not flow. This electronic trapping is removed either by finite
spin relaxation or when the Zeeman splitting is different in each quantum dot.
In the first case, our results show that measuring the current will allow to
get information on the spin relaxation time. In the last case, we will show
that applying a resonant bichromatic magnetic field, the electrons become
trapped in a coherent superposition of states and electronic transport is
blocked. Then, manipulating AC magnetic fields, electrons are driven to perform
coherent spin rotations which can be unambiguously detected by direct
measurement of the tunneling current.
"
What are the implications of the Cardassian cosmology on the study of the universe's expansion?,"  We construct the Hubble diagram (HD) of Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) with
redshifts reaching up to $z \sim 6$, by using five luminosity vs. luminosity
indicator relations calibrated with the Cardassian cosmology. This model has a
major interesting feature: despite of being matter-dominated and flat, it can
explain the present accelerate expansion of the universe. This is the first
study of this class of models using high redshift GRBs. We have performed a
$\chi$-square statistical analysis of the GRBs calibrated with the Cardassian
model, and also combined them with both the current Cosmic Microwave Background
and Baryonic Acoustic Oscillation data. Our results show consistency between
the current observational data and the model predictions. In particular, the
best-fit parameters obtained from the $\chi^2$-analysis are in agreement with
those obtained from the Concordance Cosmology ($\Lambda$-CDM). We determine the
redshift at which the universe would start to follow the Cardassian expansion,
i. e., \zc, and both the redshift at which the universe had started to
accelerate, i. e., \zac, and the age-redshift relation $H_0t_0$. Our results
also show that the universe, from the point of view of GRBs, had undergo a
transition to acceleration at a redshift $z \approx 0.2-0.7$, which agrees with
the SNIa results. Hence, after confronting the Cardassian scenario with the
GRBs HD and proving its consistency with it, we conclude that GRBs should
indeed be considered a complementary tool to several other astronomical
observations for studies of high accuracy in cosmology.
"
What is the orthodox interpretation of quantum theory and its relation to the continuity of consciousness?,"  The orthodox interpretation of quantum theory treats the subject and the
object on an equal footing. It has been suggested that the cyclical-time
process, which resolves self-reference in consciousness, interconnects the
observed universe and the mind of the subject. Based on the analogy between
cryptography and language, the concept of the common innate structure of
language, also known as universal grammar, may be associated with the
continuity in consciousness. Extending this connection, Levi-Strauss's proposal
on universal culture may be considered as a shared structure of continuity
among the consciousness of multiple subjects.
"
What are the implications of the new variant of the Feshbach map for the renormalization analysis of non-relativistic quantum electrodynamics?,"  A new variant of the Feshbach map, called smooth Feshbach map, has been
introduced recently by Bach et al., in connection with the renormalization
analysis of non-relativistic quantum electrodynamics. We analyze and clarify
its algebraic and analytic properties, and we generalize it to non-selfadjoint
partition operators $\chi$ and $\chib$.
"
What are the implications of the effect of the electromagnetic moments on the lifetime of unstable particles?,"  We show that the electromagnetic moments of unstable particles (resonances)
have an absorptive contribution which quantifies the change of the particle's
lifetime in an external electromagnetic field. To give an example we compute
here the imaginary part of the magnetic moment for the cases of the muon and
the neutron at leading order in the electroweak coupling. We also consider an
analogous effect for the strongly-decaying $\Delta$(1232) resonance. The result
for the muon is Im$ \mu = e G_F^2 m^3/768 \pi^3$, with $e$ the charge and $m$
the mass of the muon, $G_F$ the Fermi constant, which in an external magnetic
field of $B$ Tesla give rise to the relative change in the muon lifetime of
$3\times 10^{-15} B$. For neutron the effect is of a similar magnitude. We
speculate on the observable implications of this effect.
"
What are the requirements for the plasma sheath to be transparent?,"  We wish to transmit messages to and from a hypersonic vehicle around which a
plasma sheath has formed. For long distance transmission, the signal carrying
these messages must be necessarily low frequency, typically 2 GHz, to which the
plasma sheath is opaque. The idea is to use the plasma properties to make the
plasma sheath appear transparent.
"
What is the Kaluza-Klein monopole wrapped around the Y_5?,"  We construct a new giant graviton solution in AdS_5 x Y_5, with Y_5 a
quasi-regular Sasaki-Einstein manifold, consisting on a Kaluza-Klein monopole
wrapped around the Y_5 and with its Taub-NUT direction in AdS_5. We find that
this configuration has minimal energy when put in the centre of AdS_5, where it
behaves as a massless particle. When we take Y_5 to be S^5, we provide a
microscopical description in terms of multiple gravitational waves expanding
into the fuzzy S^5 defined as an S^1 bundle over the fuzzy CP^2. Finally we
provide a possible field theory dual interpretation of the construction.
"
What is the problem of the cosmic kinematic fast dynamos in Bianchi type IX cosmological models?,"  It is shown that the existence of the cosmic kinematic fast dynamos in
Bianchi type IX rotating cosmological models, faces severe difficulties, due to
the fact that in these models rotation increases without bounds, which is
strictly forbidden by CMB astronomical date which imposes strong bounds on its
rotation with respect with its rapid expansion. The only way out of this
difficulty is to assume that at least one of the expansion directions of this
anisotropic universe decays as fast as the amplification rate of primordial
magnetic fields. A solution is found where only one direction of the
anisotropic universe expands while the other two remain constants. We compute
an amplification of the seed magnetic field in the case where Bianchi IX
degenerates into de Sitter metric, fields amplify from 10^{-6}G to 10^{-5}G in
spiral galaxies for a cosmological constant of the order
$|{\Lambda}|<10^{33}s^{-2}$ and considering that the age of universe of the
order of 10^{10}yrs. Another example is given by the ABC chaotic flows in the
pseudo-Riemannian spacetime representing the Kasner anisotropic nonsingular
universe.
"
What are the distinct modes of thermal radiation from a metallic CNT in the terahertz range?,"  The thermal radiation from an isolated finite-length carbon nanotube (CNT) is
theoretically investigated both in near- and far-field zones. The formation of
the discrete spectrum in metallic CNTs in the terahertz range is demonstrated
due to the reflection of strongly slowed-down surface-plasmon modes from CNT
ends. The effect does not appear in semiconductor CNTs. The concept of CNT as a
thermal nanoantenna is proposed.
"
"What are the different types of stability in networks, including stable, unstable, and devil networks?","  Complex networks with expanding dimensions are studied, where the networks
may be directed and weighted, and network nodes are varying in discrete time in
the sense that some new nodes may be added and some old nodes may be removed
from time to time. A model of such networks in computer data transmission is
discussed. Each node on the network has fixed dimensionality, while the
dimension of the whole network is defined by the total number of nodes. Based
on the spectacular properties of data transmission on computer networks, some
new concepts of stable and unstable networks differing from the classical
Lyapunov stability are defined. In particular, a special unstable network
model, called devil network, is introduced and discussed. It is further found
that a variety of structures and connection weights affects the network
stability substantially. Several criteria on stability, instability, and devil
network are established for a rather general class of networks, where some
conditions are actually necessary and sufficient. Mathematically, this paper
makes a first attempt to rigorously formulate a fundamental issue of modeling
discrete linear time-varying systems with expanding dimensions and study their
basic stability property.
"
What is the relationship between the maximum likelihood estimator and the graphical method for determining the exponent?,"  Distributions following a power-law are an ubiquitous phenomenon. Methods for
determining the exponent of a power-law tail by graphical means are often used
in practice but are intrinsically unreliable. Maximum likelihood estimators for
the exponent are a mathematically sound alternative to graphical methods.
"
What is the corrected value of the eighth-order anomalous magnetic moment?,"  The contribution to the eighth-order anomalous magnetic moment (g-2) of the
electron from a set of diagrams without closed lepton loops is recalculated
using a new FORTRAN code generated by an automatic code generator. Comparing
the contributions of individual diagrams of old and new calculations, we found
an inconsistency in the old treatment of infrared subtraction terms in two
diagrams. Correcting this error leads to the revised value -1.9144 (35)
(alpha/pi)^4 for the eighth-order term. This theoretical change induces the
shift of the inverse of the fine structure constant by -6.41180(73)x10^{-7}.
"
What are the properties of the closed two-sided ideal and the compact operators?,"  Let $\mathfrak{T}$ denote the full Toeplitz algebra on the Bergman space of
the unit ball $\mathbb{B}_n.$ For each subset $G$ of $L^{\infty},$ let
$\mathfrak{CI}(G)$ denote the closed two-sided ideal of $\mathfrak{T}$
generated by all $T_fT_g-T_gT_f$ with $f,g\in G.$ It is known that
$\mathfrak{CI}(C(\bar{\mathbb{B}}_n))=\mathcal{K}$ - the ideal of compact
operators and $\mathfrak{CI}(C(\mathbb{B}_n))=\mathfrak{T}.$ Despite these
``extremal cases'', $\mathfrak{T}$ does contain other non-trivial ideals. This
paper gives a construction of a class of subsets $G$ of $L^{\infty}$ so that
$\mathcal{K}\subsetneq\mathfrak{CI}(G)\subsetneq\mathfrak{T}.$
"
What is the role of the PSL_2(7) subgroup in the SU(3) group?,"  The Non-Abelian finite group PSL_2(7) is the only simple subgroup of SU(3)
with a complex three-dimensional irreducible representation. It has two maximal
subgroups, S_4 which, along with its own A_4 subgroup, has been successfully
applied in numerous models of flavor, as well as the 21 element Frobenius group
Z_7 x Z_3, which has gained much less attention. We show that it can also be
used to generate tri-bimaximal mixing in the neutrino sector, while allowing
for quark and charged lepton hierarchies.
"
Is the prospect of measuring the moment of inertia I of the J0737-3039A at 10% accuracy or better unlikely given the limitations to the precision with which the system's basic binary and post-Keplerian parameters can be measured via radio timing.,"  Here we consider the possibility of measuring at 10% or better the moment of
inertia I of the J0737-3039A via the gravitomagnetic spin-orbit periastron
precession. It turns out that the prospect of measuring the moment of inertia
of PSR J0737-3039A at 10% accuracy or better seems unlikely given the
limitations to the precision with which the system's basic binary and
post-Keplerian parameters can be measured via radio timing.
"
"What is the relationship between the singlet exciton, triplet exciton, and polaron densities and conductivity in a polyfluorene organic magnetoresistive device?","  We perform charge-induced absorption and electroluminescence spectroscopy in
a polyfluorene organic magnetoresistive device. Our experiments allow us to
measure the singlet exciton, triplet exciton and polaron densities in a live
device under an applied magnetic field, and to distinguish between three
different models that were proposed to explain organic magnetoresistance. These
models are based on different spin-dependent interactions, namely exciton
formation, triplet exciton-polaron quenching and bipolaron formation. We show
that the singlet exciton, triplet exciton and polaron densities and
conductivity all increase with increasing magnetic field. Our data are
inconsistent with the exciton formation and triplet-exciton polaron quenching
models.
"
What are the two equivalent formulations of the minimality condition?,"  A new necessary minimality condition for the Mumford-Shah functional is
derived by means of second order variations. It is expressed in terms of a sign
condition for a nonlocal quadratic form on $H^1_0(\Gamma)$, $\Gamma$ being a
submanifold of the regular part of the discontinuity set of the critical point.
Two equivalent formulations are provided: one in terms of the first eigenvalue
of a suitable compact operator, the other involving a sort of nonlocal capacity
of $\Gamma$. A sufficient condition for minimality is also deduced. Finally, an
explicit example is discussed, where a complete characterization of the domains
where the second variation is nonnegative can be given.
"
What is the effect of Coulomb repulsion on the electronic phases of a frustrated lattice at different fillings?,"  Coulomb repulsion between electrons moving on a frustrated lattice can give
rise, at simple commensurate electronic densities, to exotic insulating phases
of matter. Such a phenomenon is illustrated using an extended t--J model on a
planar pyrochlore lattice for which the work on the quarter-filled case
[cond-mat/0702367] is complemented and extended to 1/8- and 3/8-fillings. The
location of the metal-insulator transition as a function of the Coulomb
repulsion is shown to depend strongly on the sign of the hopping. Quite
generally, the metal-insulator transition is characterized by lattice symmetry
breaking but the nature of the insulating Mott state is more complex than a
simple Charge Density Wave. Indeed, in the limit of large Coulomb repulsion,
the physics can be described in the framework of (extended) quantum
fully-packed loop or dimer models carrying extra spin degrees of freedom.
Various diagonal and off-diagonal plaquette correlation functions are computed
and the low-energy spectra are analyzed in details in order to characterize the
nature of the insulating phases. We provide evidence that, as for an electronic
density of n=1/2 (quarter-filling), the system at $n=1/4$ or $n=3/4$ exhibits
also plaquette order by forming a (lattice rotationally-invariant)
Resonating-Singlet-Pair Crystal, although with a quadrupling of the lattice
unit cell (instead of a doubling for $n=1/2$) and a 4-fold degenerate ground
state. Interestingly, qualitative differences with the bosonic analog (e.g.
known to exhibit columnar order at n=1/4) emphasize the important role of the
spin degrees of freedom in e.g. stabilizing plaquette phases w.r.t. rotational
symmetry-breaking phases.
"
How does reionization affect the clustering properties of galaxy samples at intermediate redshifts?,"  We consider the effect of reionization on the clustering properties of galaxy
samples at intermediate redshifts (z~0.3-5.5). Current models for the
reionization of intergalactic hydrogen predict that overdense regions will be
reionized early, thus delaying the build up of stellar mass in the progenitors
of massive lower-redshift galaxies. As a result, the stellar populations
observed in intermediate redshift galaxies are somewhat younger and hence
brighter in overdense regions of the Universe. Galaxy surveys would therefore
be sensitive to galaxies with a somewhat lower dark matter mass in overdense
regions. The corresponding increase in the observed number density of galaxies
can be parameterized as a galaxy bias due to reionization. We model this
process using merger trees combined with a stellar synthesis code. Our model
demonstrates that reionization has a significant effect on the clustering
properties of galaxy samples that are selected based on their star-formation
properties. The bias correction in Lyman-break galaxies (including those in
proposed baryonic oscillation surveys at z<1) is at the level of 10-20% for a
halo mass of 10^12 solar masses, leading to corrections factors of 1.5-2 in the
halo mass inferred from measurements of clustering length. The reionization of
helium could also lead to a sharp increase in the amplitude of the galaxy
correlation function at z~3. We find that the reionization bias is
approximately independent of scale and halo mass. However since the traditional
galaxy bias is mass dependent, the reionization bias becomes relatively more
important for lower mass systems. The correction to the bias due to
reionization is very small in surveys of luminous red galaxies at z<1.
"
"What are the constraints on the dynamics, dissipation, and production of VHE neutrinos in relativistic jets derived using opacity calculations and VHE γ-ray observations?","  Constraints on the dynamics, dissipation, and production of VHE neutrinos in
relativistic jets are derived using opacity calculations and VHE $\gamma$-ray
observations. In particular, it is demonstrated how rapid variability of the
$\gamma$-ray emission at very high energies ($> 100$ GeV) can be used to map
the location of the $\gamma$-spheres, to derive lower limits on the Doppler
factor of the $\gamma$-ray emission zone, and to constrain the photopion
production opacity. The apparent discrepancy between jet Lorentz factors
inferred from superluminal motions and source statistics in the TeV blazars and
those derived from the $\gamma$-ray emission is discussed. The relation to the
high-energy emission from the HST1 knot in M87 is briefly mentioned. Estimates
of neutrino yields in upcoming neutrino telescopes are given for various
sources. It is shown that for TeV blazars, the rapid variability of the TeV
emission implies neutrino yields well below detection limit.
"
What are the finitely presentable subgroups of residually free groups separable?,"  We prove that the finitely presentable subgroups of residually free groups
are separable and that the subgroups of type $\mathrm{FP}_\infty$ are virtual
retracts. We describe a uniform solution to the membership problem for finitely
presentable subgroups of residually free groups.
"
What are the implications of the new expressions for the angular bispectrum of temperature fluctuations for the Cosmic Microwave Background?,"  Two different predictions for the primordial curvature fluctuation bispectrum
are compared through their effects on the Cosmic Microwave Background
temperature fluctuations. The first has a local form described by a single
parameter f_{NL}. The second is based on a prediction from the warm
inflationary scenario, with a different dependence on wavenumber and a
parameter f_{WI}. New expressions are obtained for the angular bispectra of the
temperature fluctuations and for the estimators used to determine $f_{NL}$ and
f_{WI}. The standard deviation of the estimators in an ideal experiment is
roughly 5 times larger for f_{WI} than for f_{NL}. Using 3 year WMAP data gives
limits -375<f_{WI}<36.8, but there is a possibility of detecting a signal for
f_{WI} from the Planck satellite.
"
What are the implications of the convective cyclonic dynamo hypothesis on the rotation of the magnetic flux tube?,"  The topological mapping between a torus of big radius and a sphere is applied
to the Riemannian geometry of a stretched and twisted very thick magnetic flux
tube, to obtain spherical dynamos solving the magnetohydrodynamics (MHD)
self-induction equation for the magnetic flux tubes undergoing differential
(non-uniform) rotation along the tube magnetic axis. Constraints on the shear
is also computed. It is shown that when the hypothesis of the convective
cyclonic dynamo is used the rotation is constant and a solid rotational body is
obtained. As usual toroidal fields are obtained from poloidal magnetic field
and these fields may be expressed in terms of the differential rotation
${\Omega}(r,{\theta}(s))$. In the case of non-cyclonic dynamos the torsion in
the Frenet frame is compute in terms of the dynamo constant. The flux tube
shear $\frac{\partial}{{\partial}r}{\Omega}$ is also computed. The untwisted
tube case is shown to be trivial in the sense that does not support any dynamo
action. This case is in agreement with Cowling antidynamo theorem, since in the
untwisted case the tube becomes axially symmetric which the refereed theorem
rules out. We also show that it is consistent with the Zeldovich antidynamo
theorem which rules out planar dynamos. Knowledge of the differential rotation
of the Earth, for example, allows one to place limits on the curvature and
torsion of the flux tube axis and vice-versa, knowledge of the topology permit
us to infer differential rotation and other physical parameters of the stars
and planets.
"
What is the protocol for the secure transmission of a quantum state that is information-theoretically secure against an active adversary?,"  We present the first protocol for the anonymous transmission of a quantum
state that is information-theoretically secure against an active adversary,
without any assumption on the number of corrupt participants. The anonymity of
the sender and receiver is perfectly preserved, and the privacy of the quantum
state is protected except with exponentially small probability. Even though a
single corrupt participant can cause the protocol to abort, the quantum state
can only be destroyed with exponentially small probability: if the protocol
succeeds, the state is transferred to the receiver and otherwise it remains in
the hands of the sender (provided the receiver is honest).
"
"What are the symmetry relations, such as quark-lepton complementarity or tribimaximal mixing, that need to be imposed at a high scale?","  Proposed symmetry relations, e.g., quark-lepton complementarity (QLC) or
tribimaximal mixing (TBM), need to be imposed at a high scale $\wedge \sim
10^{12}$ GeV characterising the large masses of right-handed neutrinos required
to implement the seesaw mechanism. RG evolution down to the laboratory scale
$\lambda \sim 10^3$ GeV, generically prone to spoil these relations and their
predicted neutrino mixing patterns, can be made to preserve them by
appropriately constraining the Majorana phases $\alpha_{2,3}$. This is
explicitly demonstrated in the MSSM for two versions of QLC and two versions of
TBM. A preference for $\alpha_2 \simeq \pi$ (i.e. $m_1 \simeq - m_2$) emerges
in each case. Discrimination among the four cases is shown to be possible by
future measurements of $\theta_{13}$.
"
What are the key findings on the size distribution of star-forming groups in the local group spiral galaxy M33?,"  Star-formation within galaxies appears on multiple scales, from spiral
structure, to OB associations, to individual star clusters, and often
sub-structure within these clusters. This multitude of scales calls for
objective methods to find and classify star-forming regions, regardless of
spatial size. To this end, we present an analysis of star-forming groups in the
local group spiral galaxy M33, based on a new implementation of the Minimum
Spanning Tree (MST) method. Unlike previous studies which limited themselves to
a single spatial scale, we study star-forming structures from the effective
resolution limit (~20pc) to kpc scales. We find evidence for a continuum of
star-forming group sizes, from pc to kpc scales. We do not find a
characteristic scale for OB associations, unlike that found in previous
studies, and we suggest that the appearance of such a scale was caused by
spatial resolution and selection effects. The luminosity function of the groups
is found to be well represented by a power-law with an index, -2, similar to
that found for clusters and GMCs. Additionally, the groups follow a similar
mass-radius relation as GMCs. The size distribution of the groups is best
described by a log-normal distribution and we show that within a hierarchical
distribution, if a scale is selected to find structure, the resulting size
distribution will have a log-normal distribution. We find an abrupt drop of the
number of groups outside a galactic radius of ~4kpc, suggesting a change in the
structure of the star-forming ISM, possibly reflected in the lack of GMCs

What are the key results of the invariant measure for supercritical wave equations?,"  We prove that the subquartic wave equation on the three dimensional ball
$\Theta$, with Dirichlet boundary conditions admits global strong solutions for
a large set of random supercritical initial data in $\cap_{s<1/2} H^s(\Theta)$.
We obtain this result as a consequence of a general random data Cauchy theory
for supercritical wave equations developed in our previous work \cite{BT2} and
invariant measure considerations which allow us to obtain also precise large
time dynamical informations on our solutions.
"
What are the conditions for a group to be a $p$-group of exponent $p$?,"  In this paper we extend the algorithm for extraspecial groups in
\cite{iss07}, and show that the hidden subgroup problem in nil-2 groups, that
is in groups of nilpotency class at most 2, can be solved efficiently by a
quantum procedure. The algorithm presented here has several additional
features. It contains a powerful classical reduction for the hidden subgroup
problem in nilpotent groups of constant nilpotency class to the specific case
where the group is a $p$-group of exponent $p$ and the subgroup is either
trivial or cyclic. This reduction might also be useful for dealing with groups
of higher nilpotency class. The quantum part of the algorithm uses well chosen
group actions based on some automorphisms of nil-2 groups. The right choice of
the actions requires the solution of a system of quadratic and linear
equations. The existence of a solution is guaranteed by the Chevalley-Warning
theorem, and we prove that it can also be found efficiently.
"
What are the two diffusive processes at work in the accretion process in a disk with magnetic fields?,"  We consider the accretion process in a disk with magnetic fields that are
dragged in from the interstellar medium by gravitational collapse. Two
diffusive processes are at work in the system: (1) ""viscous"" torques exerted by
turbulent and magnetic stresses, and (2) ""resistive"" redistribution of mass
with respect to the magnetic flux arising from the imperfect conduction of
current. In steady state, self-consistency between the two rates of drift
requires that a relationship exists between the coefficients of turbulent
viscosity and turbulent resistivity. Ignoring any interactions with a stellar
magnetosphere, we solve the steady-state equations for a magnetized disk under
the gravitational attraction of a mass point and threaded by an amount of
magnetic flux consistent with calculations of magnetized gravitational collapse
in star formation. Our model mean-field equations have an exact analytical
solution that corresponds to magnetically diluted Keplerian rotation about the
central mass point. The solution yields the strength of the magnetic field and
the surface density as functions of radial position in the disk and their
connection with the departure from pure Keplerian rotation in representative
cases. We compare the predictions of the theory with the available observations
concerning T Tauri stars, FU Orionis stars, and low- and high-mass protostars.
Finally, we speculate on the physical causes for high and low states of the
accretion disks that surround young stellar objects. One of the more important
results of this study is the physical derivation of analytic expressions for
the turbulent viscosity and turbulent resistivity.
"
"What are the two completely different behaviors observed in the large N behavior of the theory, depending on the regularization procedure used in the path integral?","  We study the thermodynamics of maximally supersymmetric U(N) Yang-Mills
theory on $\mathds{R}\times S^2$ at large $N$. The model arises as a consistent
truncation of ${\cal N}=4$ super Yang-Mills on $\mathds{R}\times S^3$ and as
the continuum limit of the plane-wave matrix model expanded around the $N$
spherical membrane vacuum. The theory has an infinite number of classical BPS
vacua, labeled by a set of monopole numbers, described by dual supergravity
solutions. We first derive the Lagrangian and its supersymmetry transformations
as a deformation of the usual dimensional reduction of ${\cal N}=1$ gauge
theory in ten dimensions. Then we compute the partition function in the zero 't
Hooft coupling limit in different monopole backgrounds and with chemical
potentials for the $R$-charges. In the trivial vacuum we observe a first-order
Hagedorn transition separating a phase in which the Polyakov loop has vanishing
expectation value from a regime in which this order parameter is non-zero, in
analogy with the four-dimensional case. The picture changes in the monopole
vacua due to the structure of the fermionic effective action. Depending on the
regularization procedure used in the path integral, we obtain two completely
different behaviors, triggered by the absence or the appearance of a
Chern-Simons term. In the first case we still observe a first-order phase
transition, with Hagedorn temperature depending on the monopole charges. In the
latter the large $N$ behavior is obtained by solving a unitary multi-matrix
model with a peculiar logarithmic potential, the system does not present a
phase transition and it always appears in a ``deconfined'' phase.
"
What is the CDF measurement of the CP-violating asymmetry in D0 decays?,"  We present an overview of a few recent results related to CP-violation from
the Tevatron. First, we discuss a measurement of the dimuon charge asymmetry
from D{\O}that extracts the CP-violation parameter of $\Bo$ mixing and decay.
This is followed by the CDF measurement of the CP-violating asymmetry in
$\bdkpi$ decays. Finally we give the CDF result on the ratio $R = \frac{BR(B
\to D^0 K)}{BR(B \to D^0 \pi)}$
"
What are the key features of the matter power spectrum of the universe?,"  We propose a scenario in which the dark components of the Universe are
manifestations of a single bulk viscous fluid. Using dynamical system methods,
a qualitative study of the homogeneous, isotropic background scenario is
performed in order to determine the phase space of all possible solutions. The
specific model which we investigate shares similarities with a generalized
Chaplygin gas in the background but is characterized by non-adiabatic pressure
perturbations. This model is tested against supernova type Ia and matter power
spectrum data. Different from other unified descriptions of dark matter and
dark energy, the matter power spectrum is well behaved, i.e., there are no
instabilities or oscillations on small perturbation scales. The model is
competitive in comparison with the currently most popular proposals for the
description of the cosmological dark sector.
"
What is the relationship between the pion emission source function S(r) and the heavy tail of particle emission?,"  Correlation between emitted particles from a thermalized medium carry
important information about the space-time extent and the dynamics of the
particle emitting source. Pion emission source functions S(r) have been
measured in PHENIX using an imaging technique, and it has been found that it
contains a heavy (power-law) tail. It leads us to the assumption that there is
a halo of secondary pions, surrounding the core system that undergoes the
hydrodynamical evolution. THERMINATOR, a Monte Carlo event generator designed
for studies in relativistic heavy-ion collisions is used to model and
investigate the influence of resonance decays on the tail of particle emission
source. It lacks the implementation of rescattering, which, as we have learnt
from previous Hadron Rescattering Code simulations, is a possible explanation
of the power-law tail. Our studies also have shown that none of the pion
sources alone are responsible for the tail: either the resonance decays or
rescattering or a combination of these effects is a possible cause of the heavy
tail.
"
What is the relationship between the L-S boundary and the Bose-Einstein condensation state in a nanoporous glass?,"  We have studied the liquid - solid (L-S) phase transition of ^4He confined in
nanoporous glass, which has interconnected nanopores of 2.5 nm in diameter. The
L-S boundary is determined by the measurements of pressure and thermal response
during slow cooling and warming. Below 1 K, the freezing pressure is elevated
to 1.2 MPa from the bulk freezing pressure, and appears to be independent of
temperature. The T-independent L-S boundary implies the existence of a
localized Bose-Einstein condensation state, in which long-range superfluid
coherence is destroyed by narrowness of the nanopores and random potential.
"
What are the curvature singularities in the solution representing a dynamical black hole?,"  We discuss the physical interpretation of a dynamical and inhomogeneous
spherically symmetric solution obtained by Fonarev for a scalar field with an
exponential potential. There is a single parameter $w$ in the solution which
can be set to $\pm1$ if it is non-zero, in addition to the steepness parameter
$\lambda$ in the potential. The spacetime is conformally static and
asymptotically flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker spacetime. The solution reduces
to the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker solution for $w=0$. There are two curvature
singularities, of which one is a timelike central singularity and the other is
a big-bang or big-crunch type singularity. Depending on the parameters, the
spacetime can possess a future outer trapping horizon in the collapsing case.
Then the solution represents a dynamical black hole in the sense of Hayward
although there is a locally naked singularity at the center and no black-hole
event horizon. This demonstrates a weak point of the local definition of a
black hole in terms of a trapping horizon.
"
What is the method used to estimate the pixels simultaneous detection probability and the spatial resolution of pixelized detectors?,"  A novel method to estimate the pixels simultaneous detection probability and
the spatial resolution of pixelized detectors is proposed, which is based on
the determination of the statistical correlations between detector neighbor
pixels. The correlations are determined by means of noise variance measurement
for a isolated pixels and the difference between neighbor pixels. The method is
validated using images from the two different GE Senographe 2000D mammographic
units. The pixelized detector has been irradiated using x-rays along its entire
surface. It is shown that the pixel simultaneous detection probabilities can be
estimated within accuracy 0.001 - 0.003, where the systematic error is
estimated to be smaller than 0.005. The presampled two-dimensional point-spread
function (PSF0) is determined using a single Gaussian and a sum of two Gaussian
approximations. The obtained results for the presampled PSF0 show that the
single Gaussian approximation is not appropriate, and the sum of two Gaussian
approximations providing the best fit predicts the existence of a large (~50%)
narrow component. Another proof of this fact is the latest simulation study of
columnar indirect digital detectors by A. Badano et al. The sampled
two-dimensional PSF is determined using Monte Carlo simulation for the L-shape
uniform distributed acceptance function for different values of fill factors.
The detector spatial resolution is estimated using sampled PSF and has values
54 and 58 mkm for two different units. The calculation of the presampled
modulation transfer function based on the PSF0 estimation shows that the
existing data can only be reproduced using a single Gaussian approximation and
the usage of the sum of two Gaussian show significantly larger values in the
higher frequency region for both units.
"
What is the phenomenon of small chains of N=4 spins in the insulating regime of finite Heisenberg XXZ spin 1/2 chains?,"  Negative differential conductivity is reported for the far from equilibrium
quantum spin transport in the insulating regime (J_x < J_z) of finite
Heisenberg XXZ spin 1/2 chains. The phenomenon is reproduced analytically for
small chains of N=4 spins and further analyzed numerically, for up to N=16,
using an efficient pure-state simulation with stochastic spin baths.
"
"What are the properties of the source 3EG J1835+5918, and what are the implications of its non-detection for our understanding of this object?","  We report unsuccessful searches for pulsations from the neutron star RX
J1836.2+5925 identified with the EGRET source 3EG J1835+5918. A 24 hr
observation with the NRAO Green Bank Telescope at 820 MHz placed an upper limit
on flux density of 17 uJy for P > 10 ms, and gradually increasing limits for 1
< P < 10 ms. The equivalent luminosity is lower than that of any known pulsar
with the possible exception of the radio-quiet gamma-ray pulsar Geminga. A set
of observations with the Chandra X-ray Observatory HRC totaling 118 ks revealed
no pulsar with 1 ms < P < 10 s. The upper limit on its pulsed fraction is 35%
assuming a sinusoidal pulse shape. The position of RX J1836.2+5925 in Chandra
observations separated by 3 years is unchanged within errors, leading to an
upper limit on its proper motion of <0.14""/yr, or v < 530 km/s at d = 800 pc, a
maximum distance estimated from its thermal X-ray spectrum. With these null
results, the properties of 3EG J1835+5918 and its X-ray counterpart RX
J1836.2+5925 are consistent with a more distant or older version of Geminga, or
perhaps a recycled pulsar. Having nearly exhausted the capabilities of current
instrumentation at all wavelengths, it will likely fall to the Gamma-ray Large
Area Space Telescope to discover pulsations from 3EG J1835+5918.
"
What is the relationship between the W boson mass (M_W) and width (G_W) in the standard model of particle physics?,"  I present a measurement of the W boson mass (M_W) and width (G_W) using 200
and 350 pb-1 of CDF Run II data respectively. The measurements, performed in
both the electron and muon decay channels, rely on a fit to the W transverse
mass distribution. We measure M_W = 80413 +/- 48 MeV and G_W = 2032 +/- 71 MeV
which represent the world's single most precise measurements to date.
"
What is the relationship between the helium strong chemically peculiar star HD 37776 and its light curves?,"  We simulate light curves of the helium strong chemically peculiar star HD
37776 assuming that the observed periodic light variations originate as a
result of inhomogeneous horizontal distribution of chemical elements on the
surface of a rotating star. We show that chemical peculiarity influences the
monochromatic radiative flux, mainly due to bound-free processes. Using the
model of the distribution of silicon and helium on HD 37776 surface, derived
from spectroscopy, we calculate a photometric map of the surface and
consequently the uvby light curves of this star. Basically, the predicted light
curves agree in shape and amplitude with the observed ones. We conclude that
the basic properties of variability of this helium strong chemically peculiar
star can be understood in terms of the model of spots with peculiar chemical
composition.
"
What is the nature of the peaks in the 6-7 keV range in the XMM-Newton observation of the Seyfert 1 galaxy Markarian 335?,"  We report on a 133 ks XMM-Newton observation of the Seyfert 1 galaxy
Markarian 335. The 0.4-12 keV spectrum contains an underlying power law
continuum, a soft excess below 2 keV, and a double-peaked iron emission feature
in the 6-7 keV range. We investigate the possibility that the double-peaked
emission might represent the characteristic signature of the accretion disc.
Detailed investigations show that a moderately broad, accretion disc line is
most likely present, but that the peaks may be owing to narrower components
from more distant material. The peaks at 6.4 and 7 keV can be identified,
respectively, with the molecular torus in active galactic nucleus unification
schemes, and very highly ionized, optically thin gas filling the torus. The
X-ray variability spectra on both long (~100 ks) and short (~1 ks) timescales
disfavour the recent suggestion that the soft excess is an artifact of
variable, moderately ionized absorption.
"
What is the distortion measure used in the design of limited-rate CSIT systems for BICMB?,"  This paper addresses the performance of bit-interleaved coded multiple
beamforming (BICMB) [1], [2] with imperfect knowledge of beamforming vectors.
Most studies for limited-rate channel state information at the transmitter
(CSIT) assume that the precoding matrix has an invariance property under an
arbitrary unitary transform. In BICMB, this property does not hold. On the
other hand, the optimum precoder and detector for BICMB are invariant under a
diagonal unitary transform. In order to design a limited-rate CSIT system for
BICMB, we propose a new distortion measure optimum under this invariance. Based
on this new distortion measure, we introduce a new set of centroids and employ
the generalized Lloyd algorithm for codebook design. We provide simulation
results demonstrating the performance improvement achieved with the proposed
distortion measure and the codebook design for various receivers with linear
detectors. We show that although these receivers have the same performance for
perfect CSIT, their performance varies under imperfect CSIT.
"
What are the implications of the results of these comparisons for the compound nucleus 61Ni?,"  The energy spectra of neutrons, protons, and alpha-particles have been
measured from the d+59Co and 3He+58Fe reactions leading to the same compound
nucleus, 61$Ni. The experimental cross sections have been compared to
Hauser-Feshbach model calculations using different input level density models.
None of them have been found to agree with experiment. It manifests the serious
problem with available level density parameterizations especially those based
on neutron resonance spacings and density of discrete levels. New level
densities and corresponding Fermi-gas parameters have been obtained for
reaction product nuclei such as 60Ni,60Co, and 57Fe.
"
What is the main issue with the analysis of the time series in this paper?,"  This paper has been withdrawn by the authors due to a fatal error in the
analysis. The manuscript was submitted to Chemical Engineering Science. To
clarify the situation, we copy the main comment from an anonymous referee here:
""To my understanding, the authors analyze i = 1 ... 63 time series and
calculate their mean and standard deviation. These time series correspond to
individual, single ignition processes. Is this correct? If yes, these
processes, as Fig. 3 shows very clearly, are not stationary, and the pressure
difference (i.e., the signal) quickly decays to zero. In this case both the
mean and the standard deviation are poorly defined, for example because both
depend in a trivial fashion on the observation period T. I am not aware of any
study (including those cited by the authors) which allows for any conclusion
from such non-stationary signals. The results of Menezes and Barabasi are
strictly only valid for stationary time series, and they cannot be applied at
all in this case."" We agree with this insightful comment that our data are not
stationary and the method adopted in our manuscript does not apply. We do not
see any possibility to correct this error and decide to withdraw it. We would
like to thank gratefully the referee and apologize for any inconvenience caused
by our oversight.
"
"How does the stability of the layer potential operators hold under complex, $L^{\infty}$ perturbations of the coefficient matrix?","  We consider divergence form elliptic operators of the form $L=-\dv
A(x)\nabla$, defined in $R^{n+1} = \{(x,t)\in R^n \times R \}$, $n \geq 2$,
where the $L^{\infty}$ coefficient matrix $A$ is $(n+1)\times(n+1)$, uniformly
elliptic, complex and $t$-independent. We show that for such operators,
boundedness and invertibility of the corresponding layer potential operators on
$L^2(\mathbb{R}^{n})=L^2(\partial\mathbb{R}_{+}^{n+1})$, is stable under
complex, $L^{\infty}$ perturbations of the coefficient matrix. Using a variant
of the $Tb$ Theorem, we also prove that the layer potentials are bounded and
invertible on $L^2(\mathbb{R}^n)$ whenever $A(x)$ is real and symmetric (and
thus, by our stability result, also when $A$ is complex, $\Vert
A-A^0\Vert_{\infty}$ is small enough and $A^0$ is real, symmetric, $L^{\infty}$
and elliptic). In particular, we establish solvability of the Dirichlet and
Neumann (and Regularity) problems, with $L^2$ (resp. $\dot{L}^2_1)$ data, for
small complex perturbations of a real symmetric matrix. Previously, $L^2$
solvability results for complex (or even real but non-symmetric) coefficients
were known to hold only for perturbations of constant matrices (and then only
for the Dirichlet problem), or in the special case that the coefficients
$A_{j,n+1}=0=A_{n+1,j}$, $1\leq j\leq n$, which corresponds to the Kato square
root problem.
"
What are the properties of *-linear n-homomorphisms between C*-algebras?,"  An n-homomorphism between algebras is a linear map $\phi : A \to B$ such that
$\phi(a_1 ... a_n) = \phi(a_1)... \phi(a_n)$ for all elements $a_1, >..., a_n
\in A.$ Every homomorphism is an n-homomorphism, for all n >= 2, but the
converse is false, in general. Hejazian et al. [7] ask: Is every *-preserving
n-homomorphism between C*-algebras continuous? We answer their question in the
affirmative, but the even and odd n arguments are surprisingly disjoint. We
then use these results to prove stronger ones: If n >2 is even, then $\phi$ is
just an ordinary *-homomorphism. If n >= 3 is odd, then $\phi$ is a difference
of two orthogonal *-homomorphisms. Thus, there are no nontrivial *-linear
n-homomorphisms between C*-algebras.
"
What is the high-order harmonic generation (HHG) process from diatomic molecules with large internuclear distance?,"  In the present paper, we investigate the high-order harmonic generation (HHG)
from diatomic molecules with large internuclear distance using a strong field
approximation (SFA) model. We find that the hump and dip structure emerges in
the plateau region of the harmonic spectrum, and the location of this striking
structure is sensitive to the laser intensity. Our model analysis reveals that
two-center interference as well as the interference between different
recombination electron trajectories are responsible for the unusual enhanced or
suppressed harmonic yield at a certain order, and these interference effects
are greatly influenced by the laser parameters such as intensity.
"
Can future imaging surveys of galaxies distinguish between dark energy and modified gravity models for the origin of the cosmic acceleration?,"  We consider the extent to which future imaging surveys of galaxies can
distinguish between dark energy and modified gravity models for the origin of
the cosmic acceleration. Dynamical dark energy models may have similar
expansion rates as models of modified gravity, yet predict different growth of
structure histories. We parameterize the cosmic expansion by the two
parameters, $w_0$ and $w_a$, and the linear growth rate of density fluctuations
by Linder's $\gamma$, independently. Dark energy models generically predict
$\gamma \approx 0.55$, while the DGP model $\gamma \approx 0.68$. To determine
if future imaging surveys can constrain $\gamma$ within 20 percent (or
$\Delta\gamma<0.1$), we perform the Fisher matrix analysis for a weak lensing
survey such as the on-going Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) project. Under the
condition that the total observation time is fixed, we compute the Figure of
Merit (FoM) as a function of the exposure time $\texp$. We find that the
tomography technique effectively improves the FoM, which has a broad peak
around $\texp\simeq {\rm several}\sim 10$ minutes; a shallow and wide survey is
preferred to constrain the $\gamma$ parameter. While $\Delta\gamma < 0.1$
cannot be achieved by the HSC weak-lensing survey alone, one can improve the
constraints by combining with a follow-up spectroscopic survey like WFMOS
and/or future CMB observations.
"
What is the role of vertex corrections and spatial fluctuations in the prediction of a d-wave order parameter in a superconducting state?,"  I examine electron-phonon mediated superconductivity in the intermediate
coupling and phonon frequency regime of the quasi-2D Holstein model. I use an
extended Migdal-Eliashberg theory which includes vertex corrections and spatial
fluctuations. I find a d-wave superconducting state that is unique close to
half-filling. The order parameter undergoes a transition to s-wave
superconductivity on increasing filling. I explain how the inclusion of both
vertex corrections and spatial fluctuations is essential for the prediction of
a d-wave order parameter. I then discuss the effects of a large Coulomb
pseudopotential on the superconductivity (such as is found in contemporary
superconducting materials like the cuprates), which results in the destruction
of the s-wave states, while leaving the d-wave states unmodified.
"
What is the role of neutrino luminosity in the neutrino sphere during the shock re-heating epoch?,"  We investigate the enhancement of lepton number, energy, and entropy
transport resulting from active-sterile neutrino conversion $\nu_e\to\nu_s$
deep in the post-bounce supernova core followed by re-conversion
$\nu_s\to\nu_e$ further out, near the neutrino sphere. We explicitly take
account of shock wave and neutrino heating modification of the active neutrino
forward scattering potential which governs sterile neutrino production. We find
that the $\nu_e$ luminosity at the neutrino sphere could be increased by
between $\sim 10 %$ and $\sim 100 %$ during the crucial shock re-heating epoch
if the sterile neutrino has a rest mass and vacuum mixing parameters in ranges
which include those required for viable sterile neutrino dark matter. We also
find sterile neutrino transport-enhanced entropy deposition ahead of the shock.
This `` pre-heating\rq\rq can help melt heavy nuclei and thereby reduce the
nuclear photo-dissociation burden on the shock. Both neutrino luminosity
enhancement and pre-heating could increase the likelihood of a successful core
collapse supernova explosion.
"
What are the properties of geodesics in the deformed Sasaki metric?,"  We propose a special deformation of the Sasaki metric on tangent and unit
tangent bundle of a Hermitian locally symmetric manifold. Geodesics of this
deformed metric have different projections on a base manifold for tangent or
unit tangent bundle cases in contrast to usual Sasaki metric. Nevertheless, the
projections of geodesics of the unit tangent bundle still preserve the property
to have all geodesic curvatures constant.

"
What are the integral canonical models of projective Shimura varieties of Hodge type with respect to hyperspecial subgroups as pro-étale covers of Neron models?,"  We prove the existence of good smooth integral models of Shimura varieties of
Hodge type in arbitrary unramified mixed characteristic $(0,p)$. As a first
application we provide a smooth solution (answer) to a conjecture (question) of
Langlands for Shimura varieties of Hodge type. As a second application we prove
the existence in arbitrary unramified mixed characteristic $(0,p)$ of integral
canonical models of projective Shimura varieties of Hodge type with respect to
h--hyperspecial subgroups as pro-\'etale covers of N\'eron models; this forms
progress towards the proof of conjectures of Milne and Reimann. Though the
second application was known before in some cases, its proof is new and more of
a principle.
"
How do edge oxidation affect the electronic properties of edge-oxidized graphene nanoribbons?,"  We present a novel comprehensive first-principles theoretical study of the
electronic properties and relative stabilities of edge-oxidized zigzag graphene
nanoribbons. The oxidation schemes considered include hydroxyl, carboxyl,
ether, and ketone groups. Using screened exchange density functional theory, we
show that these oxidized ribbons are more stable than hydrogen-terminated
nanoribbons except for the case of the etheric groups. The stable oxidized
configurations maintain a spin-polarized ground state with antiferromagnetic
ordering localized at the edges, similar to the fully hydrogenated
counterparts. More important, edge oxidation is found to lower the onset
electric field required to induce half-metallic behavior and extend the overall
field range at which the systems remain half-metallic. Once the half-metallic
state is reached, further increase of the external electric field intensity
produces a rapid decrease in the spin magnetization up to a point where the
magnetization is quenched completely. Finally, we find that oxygen containing
edge groups have a minor effect on the energy difference between the
antiferromagnetic ground state and the above-lying ferromagnetic state.
"
What is the current determination of the angle gamma of the unitarity triangle from the U-spin-related decays?,"  Several years ago, it was pointed out that the U-spin-related decays
$B_d\to\pi^+\pi^-$, $B_s\to K^+K^-$ and $B_d\to\pi^\mp K^\pm$, $B_s\to \pi^\pm
K^\mp$ offer interesting strategies for the extraction of the angle gamma of
the unitarity triangle. Using the first results from the Tevatron on the $B_s$
decays and the B-factory data on $B_{u,d}$ modes, we compare the determinations
of gamma from both strategies, study the sensitivity on U-spin-breaking
effects, discuss the resolution of discrete ambiguities, predict observables
that were not yet measured but will be accessible at LHCb, explore the
extraction of the width difference $\Delta\Gamma_s$ from untagged $B_s\to
K^+K^-$ rates, and address the impact of new physics. The data for the
$B_d\to\pi^+\pi^-$, $B_s\to K^+K^-$ system favour the BaBar measurement of
direct CP violation in $B_d\to\pi^+\pi^-$, which will be used in the numerical
analysis, and result in a fortunate situation, yielding
$\gamma=(66.6^{+4.3+4.0}_{-5.0-3.0})^\circ$, where the latter errors correspond
to a generous estimate of U-spin-breaking effects. On the other hand, the
$B_d\to\pi^\mp K^\pm$, $B_s\to \pi^\pm K^\mp$ analysis leaves us with
$26^\circ\leq\gamma\leq70^\circ$, and points to a value of the $B_s\to \pi^\pm
K^\mp$ branching ratio that is larger than the current Tevatron result. An
important further step will be the measurement of mixing-induced CP violation
in $B_s\to K^+K^-$, which will also allow us to extract the $B^0_s$--$\bar
B^0_s$ mixing phase unambiguously with the help of $B_s\to J/\psi \phi$ at the
LHC. Finally, the measurement of direct CP violation in $B_s\to K^+K^-$ will
make the full exploitation of the physics potential of the $B_{s,d}\to \pi\pi,
\pi K, KK$ modes possible.
"
What does the elliptic summand imply for the (periodic) cyclic homology of the group algebra?,"  We show that the image of Connes-Karoubi-Chern character, restricted to the
image of the Baum-Connes assembly map in the Bott-periodized topological
K-theory of the complex group algebra, lies in the elliptic summand of the
(periodic) cyclic homology of the group algebra. This implies that for any
(weighted) ell-1 completion of the group algebra, rational surjectivity of the
Baum-Connes assembly map implies the generalized Bass conjecture for that
algebra.
"
What is the proof of the result of Brendle-Schoen on the differential sphere theorem?,"  The paper provides a different proof of the result of Brendle-Schoen on the
differential sphere theorem. It is shown directly that the invariant cone of
curvature operators with positive (or non-negative) complex sectional curvature
is preserved by the Ricci flow. This implies, by a result of B\""ohm-Wilking,
that the normalized Ricci flow deforms such a metric to a metric of constant
positive curvature. Using earlier work of Yau and Zheng it can be shown that a
metric with strictly (pointwise) 1/4-pinched sectional curvature has positive
complex sectional curvature. This gives a direct proof of Brendle-Schoen's
recent differential sphere theorem, bypassing any discussion of positive
isotropic curvature.
"
What are the jet-like contributions to the correlation peak?,"  We present results on two-particle correlations using singly-strange
particles ($\Lambda$, $\bar{\Lambda}$, $K^0_S$) and charged hadrons at
intermediate p_T in d+Au and Au+Au collisions at RHIC. We discuss properties of
the near-side correlation peak in both azimuthal and pseudo-rapidity space and
separate jet-like contributions from the long-range pseudo-rapidity
correlations (the ridge). In particular, we study the centrality and p_T
dependence of the jet and ridge yields for various trigger and associated
particle species and compare the results to model predictions.
"
Can a delayed feedback ratchet outperform its open-loop counterpart under certain conditions?,"  Closed-loop or feedback control ratchets use information about the state of
the system to operate with the aim of maximizing the performance of the system.
In this paper we investigate the effects of a time delay in the feedback for a
protocol that performs an instantaneous maximization of the center-of-mass
velocity. For the one and the few particle cases the flux decreases with
increasing delay, as an effect of the decorrelation of the present state of the
system with the information that the controller uses, but the delayed
closed-loop protocol succeeds to perform better than its open-loop counterpart
provided the delays are smaller than the characteristic times of the Brownian
ratchet. For the many particle case, we also show that for small delays the
center-of-mass velocity decreases for increasing delays. However, for large
delays we find the surprising result that the presence of the delay can improve
the performance of the nondelayed feedback ratchet and the flux can attain the
maximum value obtained with the optimal periodic protocol. This phenomenon is
the result of the emergence of a dynamical regime where the presence of the
delayed feedback stabilizes one quasiperiodic solution or several
(multistability), which resemble the solutions obtained in the so-called
threshold protocol. Our analytical and numerical results point towards the
feasibility of an experimental implementation of a feedback controlled ratchet
that performs equal or better than its optimal open-loop version.
"
What is the Lorentz-invariant surface used in the canonical quantization of relativistic field theories?,"  We examine canonical quantization of relativistic field theories on the
forward hyperboloid, a Lorentz-invariant surface of the form $x_\mu x^\mu =
\tau^2$. This choice of quantization surface implies that all components of the
4-momentum operator are affected by interactions (if present), whereas rotation
and boost generators remain interaction free -- a feature characteristic of
Dirac's `` point-form\rq\rq of relativistic dynamics. Unlike previous attempts
to quantize fields on space-time hyperboloids, we keep the usual plane-wave
expansion of the field operators and consider evolution of the system generated
by the 4-momentum operator. We verify that the Fock-space representations of
the Poincar\'e generators for free scalar and spin-1/2 fields look the same as
for equal-time quantization. Scattering is formulated for interacting fields in
a covariant interaction picture and it is shown that the familiar perturbative
expansion of the S-operator is recovered by our approach. An appendix analyzes
special distributions, integrals over the forward hyperboloid, that are used
repeatedly in the paper.
"
What is the physics contribution to the lifetime difference in $D^0 - \bar{D}^0$ mixing?,"  New physics contribution to the lifetime difference in $D^0 - \bar{D}^0$
mixing is re-examined within the non-manifest Left-Right Symmetric Model.
Diagrams with one of $\Delta C = 1$ transitions, mediated by a propagator with
$W_L - W_R$ mixing, are revisited. While these diagrams are believed to give
the dominant contribution, compatible with the experimental data, it is shown
that due to GIM cancelation, such diagrams are negligible in sum. Thus,
Left-Right Symmetric Model contribution to the lifetime difference in $D^0 -
\bar{D}^0$ mixing is about two orders of magnitude less than actual
experimental value for $\Delta \Gamma_D$.
"
"What is the significance of the chemical gradients across the spiral ""arm"" in the cluster?","  Sharp edges in X-ray surface brightness with continuous gas pressure called
cold fronts have been often found in relaxed galaxy clusters such as Abell 496.
Models that explain cold fronts as surviving cores of head-on subcluster
mergers do not work well for these clusters and competing models involving gas
sloshing have been recently proposed. Here, we test some concrete predictions
of these models in a combined analysis of density, temperature, metal
abundances and abundance ratios in a deep Chandra exposure of Abell 496. We
confirm that the chemical discontinuities found in this cluster are not
consistent with a core merger remnant scenario. However, we find chemical
gradients across a spiral ""arm"" discovered at 73 kpc north of the cluster
center and coincident with the sharp edge of the main cold front in the
cluster. Despite the overall SN Ia iron mass fraction dominance found within
the cooling radius of this cluster, the metal enrichment along the arm,
determined from silicon and iron abundances, is consistent with a lower SN Ia
iron mass fraction (51% +- 14%) than that measured in the surrounding regions
(85% +- 14%). The ""arm"" is also significantly colder than the surroundings by
0.5-1.6 keV. The arm extends from a boxy colder region surrounding the center
of the cluster, where two other cold fronts are found. This cold arm is a
prediction of current high resolution numerical simulations as a result of an
off-center encounter with a less massive pure dark matter halo and we suggest
that the cold fronts in A496 provide the first clear corroboration of such
model, where the closest encounter happened ~ 0.5 Gyr ago. We also argue for a
possible candidate dark matter halo responsible for the cold fronts in the
outskirts of A496.
"
What is the twist fields in quantum field theory that are related to branch points in an n-sheeted Riemann surface?,"  In this paper we compute the leading correction to the bipartite entanglement
entropy at large sub-system size, in integrable quantum field theories with
diagonal scattering matrices. We find a remarkably universal result, depending
only on the particle spectrum of the theory and not on the details of the
scattering matrix. We employ the ""replica trick"" whereby the entropy is
obtained as the derivative with respect to n of the trace of the n-th power of
the reduced density matrix of the sub-system, evaluated at n=1. The main
novelty of our work is the introduction of a particular type of twist fields in
quantum field theory that are naturally related to branch points in an
n-sheeted Riemann surface. Their two-point function directly gives the scaling
limit of the trace of the n-th power of the reduced density matrix. Taking
advantage of integrability, we use the expansion of this two-point function in
terms of form factors of the twist fields, in order to evaluate it at large
distances in the two-particle approximation. Although this is a well-known
technique, the new geometry of the problem implies a modification of the form
factor equations satisfied by standard local fields of integrable quantum field
theory. We derive the new form factor equations and provide solutions, which we
specialize both to the Ising and sinh-Gordon models.
"
What is the minimal resources required for measurement-based quantum computation?,"  We improve the upper bound on the minimal resources required for
measurement-based quantum computation. Minimizing the resources required for
this model is a key issue for experimental realization of a quantum computer
based on projective measurements. This new upper bound allows also to reply in
the negative to the open question about the existence of a trade-off between
observable and ancillary qubits in measurement-based quantum computation.
"
What is the Banach space in which algebraicity is a property?,"  In his article ""A discrete form of the theorem that each field endomorphism
of $\mathbb{R}$ ($\mathbb{Q}_p$) is the identity"", Tyszka introduce a logical
property which is equivalent to algebraicity in $\mathbb{R}$ and in
$\mathbb{Q}_p$. Amazingly, the property is no longer equivalent to algebraicity
in $\mathbb{C}$. This article present a similirar property which is equivalent
to algebraicity in any field of characteristic zero which is also a Banach
space, and prove a weaker equivalency for fields of positive charcteristic
(which are also Banach spaces).
"
What is the convergence of normalized Harder-Narasimhan polygons in geometric and arithmetic frameworks?,"  We establish in this article convergence results of normalized
Harder-Narasimhan polygons both in geometric and in arithmetic frameworks by
introducing the Harder-Narasimhan filtration indexed by $\mathbb R$ and the
associated Borel probability measure.
"
What is the non-Bayesian fusion rule for combining densities of probabilities?,"  This paper defines and implements a non-Bayesian fusion rule for combining
densities of probabilities estimated by local (non-linear) filters for tracking
a moving target by passive sensors. This rule is the restriction to a strict
probabilistic paradigm of the recent and efficient Proportional Conflict
Redistribution rule no 5 (PCR5) developed in the DSmT framework for fusing
basic belief assignments. A sampling method for probabilistic PCR5 (p-PCR5) is
defined. It is shown that p-PCR5 is more robust to an erroneous modeling and
allows to keep the modes of local densities and preserve as much as possible
the whole information inherent to each densities to combine. In particular,
p-PCR5 is able of maintaining multiple hypotheses/modes after fusion, when the
hypotheses are too distant in regards to their deviations. This new p-PCR5 rule
has been tested on a simple example of distributed non-linear filtering
application to show the interest of such approach for future developments. The
non-linear distributed filter is implemented through a basic particles
filtering technique. The results obtained in our simulations show the ability
of this p-PCR5-based filter to track the target even when the models are not
well consistent in regards to the initialization and real cinematic.
"
What is the exponent of the power-law distribution of opening moves in chess?,"  We perform a quantitative analysis of extensive chess databases and show that
the frequencies of opening moves are distributed according to a power-law with
an exponent that increases linearly with the game depth, whereas the pooled
distribution of all opening weights follows Zipf's law with universal exponent.
We propose a simple stochastic process that is able to capture the observed
playing statistics and show that the Zipf law arises from the self-similar
nature of the game tree of chess. Thus, in the case of hierarchical
fragmentation the scaling is truly universal and independent of a particular
generating mechanism. Our findings are of relevance in general processes with
composite decisions.
"
What are the implications of the photovoltage technique for the analysis of electromagnetic fluctuations?,"  The main argument against the reality of the electromagnetic vacuum
fluctuations is that they do not activate photon detectors. In order to meet
this objection we propose a classical model of a photodetector which, in the
simple case of a light signal with constant intensity, gives a counting rate
which is a non-linear function of the intensity. For sufficiently large signal
intensity, the counting rate is proportional to the intensity, in agreement
with the standard quantum results, but there is a dark rate when the signal
intensity is low.
"
"What is the Eguchi-Hanson space, which is a five-dimensional space, used to model coalescing black holes?","  Using the numerical method, we study dynamics of coalescing black holes on
the Eguchi-Hanson base space. Effects of a difference in spacetime topology on
the black hole dynamics is discussed. We analyze appearance and disappearance
process of marginal surfaces. In our calculation, the area of a coverall black
hole horizon at the creation time in the coalescing black holes solutions on
Eguchi-Hanson space is larger than that in the five-dimensional Kastor-Traschen
solutions. This fact suggests that the black hole production on the
Eguchi-Hanson space is easier than that on the flat space.
"
What are the Kazhdan-Lusztig duality of Verlinde algebra?,"  We construct the representation of Double Affine Hecke Algebra whose
symmetrization gives the center of the quantum group U_q(sl(2)) and by
Kazhdan--Lusztig duality the Verlinde algebra of (1,p) models of logarithmic
conformal field theory.
"
What are the observables of this picture in the Dirac quantum mechanics?,"  The Schr\"" odinger picture of the Dirac quantum mechanics is defined in
charts with spatially flat Robertson-Walker metrics and Cartesian coordinates.
The main observables of this picture are identified, including the interacting
part of the Hamiltonian operator produced by the minimal coupling with the
gravitational field. It is shown that in this approach new Dirac quantum modes
on de Sitter spacetimes may be found analytically solving the Dirac equation.
"
What is the general covariant energy-momentum tensor of the gravitational system in general five-dimensional cosmological brane-world models?,"  We analyze the general covariant energy-momentum tensor of the gravitational
system in genreal five-dimensional cosmological brane-world models. Then
through calculating this energy-momentum for the cosmological generalization of
the Randall-Sundrum model, which includes the original RS model as the static
limit, we are able to show that the weakness of the gravitation on the
""visible"" brane is a general feature of this model. This is the origin of the
gauge hierarchy from a gravitational point of view. Our results are also
consistent with the fact that a gravitational system has vanishing total
energy.
"
What is the Penna model of 1995?,"  This review deals with computer simulation of biological ageing, particularly
with the Penna model of 1995.
"
"What is the qualitative features of the distilled entanglement in a two-dimensional ""phase diagram""?","  We develop a framework to calculate the density matrix of a pair of photons
emitted in a decay cascade with partial ""which path"" ambiguity. We describe an
appropriate entanglement distillation scheme which works also for certain
random cascades. The qualitative features of the distilled entanglement are
presented in a two dimensional ""phase diagram"". The theory is applied to the
quantum tomography of the decay cascade of a biexciton in a semiconductor
quantum dot. Agreement with experiment is obtained.
"
Can we diagnose the fireball of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) using pair-signatures?,"  We present recipes to diagnose the fireball of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) by
combining observations of electron-positron pair-signatures (the
pair-annihilation line and the cutoff energy due to the pair-creation process).
Our recipes are largely model-independent and extract information even from the
non-detection of either pair-signature. We evaluate physical quantities such as
the Lorentz factor, optical depth and pair-to-baryon ratio, only from the
observable quantities. In particular, we can test whether the prompt emission
of GRBs comes from the pair/baryonic photosphere or not. The future-coming
Gamma-Ray Large Area Space Telescope (GLAST) satellite will provide us with
good chances to use our recipes by detecting or non-detecting pair-signatures.
"
What are the lower bounds for the number of non-real zeros of a second-order linear differential polynomial with constant coefficients in a real entire function with finitely many non-real zeros?,"  Lower bounds are given for the number of non-real zeros of a second order
linear differential polynomial with constant coefficients in a real entire
function with finitely many non-real zeros.
"
What are the results for lifetime differences including non-perturbative 1/m_b and 1/m_b^2 corrections?,"  We present a calculation of 1/m^2_b corrections to the lifetime differences
of B_s mesons \Delta \Gamma_s in the heavy-quark expansion. We find that they
are small to significantly affect \Delta \Gamma_s and present the result for
lifetime difference including non-perturbative 1/m_b and 1/m_b^2 corrections.
We also analyze the generic \Delta B = 1 New Physics contributions to \Delta
\Gamma_s and provide several examples.
"
What are the coupled potential curves in the four-body problem in the adiabatic hyperspherical representation?,"  The four-particle system is the simplest few-body system containing the
fundamental physics involved in ultracold fermionic gases. We have made recent
efforts to solve the quantum four-body problem in the adiabatic hyperspherical
representation. Our approach yields a set of coupled potential curves that can
in turn be solved for all elastic and inelastic processes. These rates may play
an important role in the lifetime of molecules in ultracold fermi gases. We
believe this will lead to a deeper understanding of ultracold fermi systems and
the physics of the BCS-BEC crossover.
"
"correlation, and what is the interpretation of the E_peak-E_gamma","  In their recent paper, Campana et al. (2007) found that 5 bursts, among those
detected by Swift, are outliers with respect to the E_peak-E_gamma
(""Ghirlanda"") correlation. We instead argue that they are not.
"
What are the properties of the C*-envelope of the algebra $\A_u$?,"  An analysis is given of $*$-representations of rank 2 single vertex graphs.
We develop dilation theory for the non-selfadjoint algebras $\A_\theta$ and
$\A_u$ which are associated with the commutation relation permutation $\theta$
of a 2 graph and, more generally, with commutation relations determined by a
unitary matrix $u$ in $M_m(\bC) \otimes M_n(\bC)$. We show that a defect free
row contractive representation has a unique minimal dilation to a
$*$-representation and we provide a new simpler proof of Solel's row isometric
dilation of two $u$-commuting row contractions. Furthermore it is shown that
the C*-envelope of $\A_u$ is the generalised Cuntz algebra $\O_{X_u}$ for the
product system $X_u$ of $u$; that for $m\geq 2 $ and $n \geq 2 $ contractive
representations of $\Ath$ need not be completely contractive; and that the
universal tensor algebra $\T_+(X_u)$ need not be isometrically isomorphic to
$\A_u$.
"
What are the efforts of your group to explore nuclear interactions in the medium through the equation of state?,"  Microscopic studies of nuclear matter under diverse conditions of density and
asymmetry are of great contemporary interest. Concerning terrestrial
applications, they relate to future experimental facilities that will make it
possible to study systems with extreme neutron-to-proton ratio. In this talk, I
will review recent efforts of my group aimed at exploring nuclear interactions
in the medium through the nuclear equation of state (EoS). The approach we take
is microscopic and relativistic, with the predicted EoS properties derived from
realistic nucleon-nucleon potentials. I will also discuss work in progress.
Most recently, we completed a DBHF calculation of the $\Lambda$ hyperon binding
energy in nuclear matter.
"
What are the q-deformed parafermion and fuzzy torus related concepts?,"  We note that the recently introduced fuzzy torus can be regarded as a
q-deformed parafermion. Based on this picture, classification of the Hermitian
representations of the fuzzy torus is carried out. The result involves
Fock-type representations and new finite dimensional representations for q
being a root of unity as well as already known finite dimensional ones.
"
What are the known CSI supergravity solutions in the Kundt class?,"  We study a class of constant scalar invariant (CSI) spacetimes, which belong
to the higher-dimensional Kundt class, that are solutions of supergravity. We
review the known CSI supergravity solutions in this class and we explicitly
present a number of new exact CSI supergravity solutions, some of which are
Einstein.
"
What are the implications of the Kramers' problem in the context of a forecasting game?,"  We analyze the dynamics of a forecasting game which exhibits the phenomenon
of information cascades. Each agent aims at correctly predicting a binary
variable and he/she can either look for independent information or herd on the
choice of others. We show that dynamics can be analitically described in terms
of a Langevin equation and its collective behavior is described by the solution
of a Kramers' problem. This provides very accurate results in the region where
the vast majority of agents herd, which corresponds to the most interesting one
from a game theoretic point of view.
"
What are the results of the calculations for the electron-phonon coupling constant in Mg10Ir19B16?,"  Electronic structure of a novel superconducting noncentrosymmetric compound
Mg10Ir19B16 was calculated using the Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker method. Electronic
part of the electron-phonon coupling constant, McMillan-Hopfield parameters,
were calculated using the rigid-muffin-tin approximation (RMTA). The magnitude
of the electron-phonon coupling constant, analysing atomic contributions, is
discussed. Our results show, that superconductivity in Mg10Ir19B16 is
presumably mediated by electron-phonon interaction.
"
What is the nature of the intermolecular interactions on Au (111)?,"  The low-coverage adsorption of a molecular electron donor,
tetrathiafulvalene, on Au(111) is characterized by the spontaneous formation of
superlattice of monomers, whose spacing exceeds the equilibrium distance of
non-covalent interactions and depends on coverage. The origin of this peculiar
growth mode is due to a long-range repulsive interaction between molecules. The
analysis of molecular-pair distributions obtained by scanning tunneling
microscopy measurements permits us to determine that the nature of TTF
intermolecular interactions on Au (111) is electrostatic. A repulsion between
molecules is caused by the accumulation of charge due to electron donation into
the metal surface, as pictured through density functional theory calculations.
"
What is the role of the chromosphere in the flare process?,"  In this topical review I revisit the ""chromospheric flare."" This should
currently be an outdated concept, because modern data seem to rule out the
possiblity of a major flare happening independently in the chromosphere alone,
but the chromosphere still plays a major observational role in many ways. It is
the source of the bulk of a flare's radiant energy - in particular the
visible/UV continuum radiation. It also provides tracers that guide us to the
coronal source of the energy, even though we do not yet understand the
propagation of the energy from its storage in the corona to its release in the
chromosphere. The formation of chromospheric radiations during a flare presents
several difficult and interesting physical problems.
"
What is the relation between the intensities of the emission lines of NeIII and OIII in the calibration of metallicities for galaxies at high z?,"  In this work we present a study of the strong optical collisional emission
lines of Ne and Ar in an heterogeneous sample of ionized gaseous nebulae for
which it is possible to derive directly the electron temperature and hence the
chemical abundances of neon and argon. We calculate using a grid of
photoionization models new ionization correction factors for these two elements
and we study the behaviour of Ne/O and Ar/O abundance ratios with metallicity.
We find a constant value for Ne/O, while there seems to be some evidence for
the existence of negative radial gradients of Ar/O over the disks of some
nearby spirals. We study the relation between the intensities of the emission
lines of [NeIII] at 3869 \AA and [OIII] at 4959 \AA and 5007 \AA. This relation
can be used in empirical calibrations and diagnostic ratios extending their
applicability to bluer wavelengths and therefore to samples of objects at
higher redshifts. Finally, we propose a new diagnostic using [OII], [NeIII] and
Hdelta emission lines to derive metallicities for galaxies at high z.
"
What is the classical theory of ion beam sputtering?,"  The classical theory of ion beam sputtering predicts the instability of a
flat surface to uniform ion irradiation at any incidence angle. We relax the
assumption of the classical theory that the average surface erosion rate is
determined by a Gaussian response function representing the effect of the
collision cascade and consider the surface dynamics for other
physically-motivated response functions. We show that although instability of
flat surfaces at any beam angle results from all Gaussian and a wide class of
non-Gaussian erosive response functions, there exist classes of modifications
to the response that can have a dramatic effect. In contrast to the classical
theory, these types of response render the flat surface linearly stable, while
imperceptibly modifying the predicted sputter yield vs. incidence angle. We
discuss the possibility that such corrections underlie recent reports of a
``window of stability'' of ion-bombarded surfaces at a range of beam angles for
certain ion and surface types, and describe some characteristic aspects of
pattern evolution near the transition from unstable to stable dynamics. We
point out that careful analysis of the transition regime may provide valuable
tests for the consistency of any theory of pattern formation on ion sputtered
surfaces.
"
What are the four gravitationally lensed quasars discovered in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey?,"  We present the discovery of four gravitationally lensed quasars selected from
the spectroscopic quasar catalog of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We describe
imaging and spectroscopic follow-up observations that support the lensing
interpretation of the following four quasars: SDSS J0832+0404 (image separation
\theta=1.98"", source redshift z_s=1.115, lens redshift z_l=0.659); SDSS
J1216+3529 (\theta=1.49"", z_s=2.012); SDSS J1322+1052 (\theta=2.00"",
z_s=1.716); and SDSS J1524+4409 (\theta=1.67"", z_s=1.210, z_l=0.320). Each
system has two lensed images. We find that the fainter image component of SDSS
J0832+0404 is significantly redder than the brighter component, perhaps because
of differential reddening by the lensing galaxy. The lens potential of SDSS
J1216+3529 might be complicated by the presence of a secondary galaxy near the
main lensing galaxy.
"
What are the challenges in determining the spin-glass ground states?,"  Due to an extremely rugged structure of the free energy landscape, the
determination of spin-glass ground states is among the hardest known
optimization problems, found to be NP-hard in the most general case. Owing to
the specific structure of local (free) energy minima, general-purpose
optimization strategies perform relatively poorly on these problems, and a
number of specially tailored optimization techniques have been developed in
particular for the Ising spin glass and similar discrete systems. Here, an
efficient optimization heuristic for the much less discussed case of continuous
spins is introduced, based on the combination of an embedding of Ising spins
into the continuous rotators and an appropriate variant of a genetic algorithm.
Statistical techniques for insuring high reliability in finding (numerically)
exact ground states are discussed, and the method is benchmarked against the
simulated annealing approach.
"
What are the intrinsic spin-Hall accumulation (ISHA) patterns on the Bi(111) surface?,"  Local spin and charge densities on a two-dimensional honeycomb lattice are
calculated by the Landauer-Keldysh formalism (LKF). Through the empirical
tight-binding method, we show how the realistic band structure can be brought
into the LKF. Taking the Bi(111) surface, on which strong surface states and
Rashba spin-orbit coupling are present [Phys. Rev. Lett. 93, 046403 (2004)], as
a numeric example, we show typical intrinsic spin-Hall accumulation (ISHA)
patterns thereon. The Fermi-energy-dependence of the spin and charge transport
in two-terminal nanostructure samples is subsequently analyzed. By changing
E_{F}, we show that the ISHA pattern is nearly isotropic (free-electron-like)
only when E_{F} is close to the band bottom, and is sensitive/insensitive to
E_{F} for the low/high bias regime with such E_{F}. With E_{F} far from the
band bottom, band structure effects thus enter the ISHA patterns and the
transport direction becomes significant.
"
Can the noncommutative algebra be used to introduce covariant derivatives for gauge and gravity fields in a way that preserves diffeomorphism invariance?,"  Recent work [hep-th/0504183,hep-th/0508002] indicates an approach to the
formulation of diffeomorphism invariant quantum field theories (qft's) on the
Groenewold-Moyal (GM) plane. In this approach to the qft's, statistics gets
twisted and the S-matrix in the non-gauge qft's becomes independent of the
noncommutativity parameter theta^{\mu\nu}. Here we show that the noncommutative
algebra has a commutative spacetime algebra as a substructure: the Poincare,
diffeomorphism and gauge groups are based on this algebra in the twisted
approach as is known already from the earlier work of [hep-th/0510059]. It is
natural to base covariant derivatives for gauge and gravity fields as well on
this algebra. Such an approach will in particular introduce no additional gauge
fields as compared to the commutative case and also enable us to treat any
gauge group (and not just U(N)). Then classical gravity and gauge sectors are
the same as those for \theta^{\mu \nu}=0, but their interactions with matter
fields are sensitive to theta^{\mu \nu}. We construct quantum noncommutative
gauge theories (for arbitrary gauge groups) by requiring consistency of twisted
statistics and gauge invariance. In a subsequent paper (whose results are
summarized here), the locality and Lorentz invariance properties of the
S-matrices of these theories will be analyzed, and new non-trivial effects
coming from noncommutativity will be elaborated.
  This paper contains further developments of [hep-th/0608138] and a new
formulation based on its approach.
"
What are the sufficient conditions for the convergence of the pinning process locally and globally?,"  In this paper, without assuming symmetry, irreducibility, or linearity of the
couplings, we prove that a single controller can pin a coupled complex network
to a homogenous solution. Sufficient conditions are presented to guarantee the
convergence of the pinning process locally and globally. An effective approach
to adapt the coupling strength is proposed. Several numerical simulations are
given to verify our theoretical analysis.
"
What are the two techniques used to characterize attosecond high harmonic pulses in a long Ar-filled gas cell?,"  The attosecond high harmonic pulses obtained from a long Ar-filled gas cell
were characterized by two techniques - the reconstruction of attosecond beating
by interference of two-photon transition (RABITT) and frequency-resolved
optical gating (FROG) methods. The pulse durations obtained by RABITT and FROG
methods agreed within 10 %.
"
What is the impact of temperature on the period and the dissipation of oscillations in the torsional oscillator?,"  We have used a torsional oscillator with square cross section and a resonance
frequency of 185 Hz to confirm the nonclassical rotational inertia (NCRI)
discovered by Kim and Chan\cite{1,2}. We have also found a strong correlation
between the NCRI signal and a high dissipation Q$^{-1}$ of 4 $\times$ 10$^{-6}$
of the oscillation above the transition temperature. Here, we present
preliminary results of the annealing process in $^{4}$He at a pressure of 26
bar. When holding the temperature constant above 1 K we have observed a
immediate rise in the period and a slow decay of the dissipation. The
equilibrium value of Q$^{-1}$ decreases with increasing temperature.
"
What are the improvements to the quark and antiquark distributions and their uncertainties?,"  We present a preliminary set of updated NLO parton distributions. For the
first time we have a quantitative extraction of the strange quark and antiquark
distributions and their uncertainties determined from CCFR and NuTeV dimuon
cross sections. Additional jet data from HERA and the Tevatron improve our
gluon extraction. Lepton asymmetry data and neutrino structure functions
improve the flavour separation, particularly constraining the down quark
valence distribution.
"
What is the iterative algorithm for approximating the Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimator?,"  The problem of the definition and the estimation of generative models based
on deformable templates from raw data is of particular importance for modelling
non aligned data affected by various types of geometrical variability. This is
especially true in shape modelling in the computer vision community or in
probabilistic atlas building for Computational Anatomy (CA). A first coherent
statistical framework modelling the geometrical variability as hidden variables
has been given by Allassonni\`ere, Amit and Trouv\'e (JRSS 2006). Setting the
problem in a Bayesian context they proved the consistency of the MAP estimator
and provided a simple iterative deterministic algorithm with an EM flavour
leading to some reasonable approximations of the MAP estimator under low noise
conditions. In this paper we present a stochastic algorithm for approximating
the MAP estimator in the spirit of the SAEM algorithm. We prove its convergence
to a critical point of the observed likelihood with an illustration on images
of handwritten digits.
"
What is the Cauchy problem in the Sobolev space?,"  The Cauchy problem for the Kadomtsev-Petviashvili-II equation
(u_t+u_{xxx}+uu_x)_x+u_{yy}=0 is considered. A small data global well-posedness
and scattering result in the scale invariant, non-isotropic, homogeneous
Sobolev space \dot H^{-1/2,0}(R^2) is derived. Additionally, it is proved that
for arbitrarily large initial data the Cauchy problem is locally well-posed in
the homogeneous space \dot H^{-1/2,0}(R^2) and in the inhomogeneous space
H^{-1/2,0}(R^2), respectively.
"
What is the kernel of the algebra A_P?,"  We show that the following two algebras are isomorphic. The first is the
algebra $A_P$ of functions on the scheme of monic linear second-order
differential operators on $\C$ with prescribed regular singular points at
$z_1,..., z_n, \infty$, prescribed exponents $\La^{(1)}, ..., \La^{(n)},
\La^{(\infty)}$ at the singular points, and having the kernel consisting of
polynomials only. The second is the Bethe algebra of commuting linear
operators, acting on the vector space $\Sing L_{\La^{(1)}} \otimes ... \otimes
L_{\La^{(n)}}[\La^{(\infty)}]$ of singular vectors of weight $\La^{(\infty)}$
in the tensor product of finite dimensional polynomial $gl_2$-modules with
highest weights $\La^{(1)},..., \La^{(n)}$.
"
What are the monodromy representations of differential equations defined by elliptic Dunkl operators?,"  We attach elliptic Dunkl operators to an abelian variety with a finite group
action. This generalizes elliptic Dunkl operators for Weyl groups, defined by
Buchstaber, Felder, and Veselov in 1994. We show that these operators commute,
and use them to define representations from category O of elliptic Cherednik
algebras. We also consider the monodromy representations of differential
equations defined by elliptic Dunkl operators, and show that they yield finite
dimensional rrepresentations of generalized double affine Hecke algebras.
"
What is the relationship between Lorentz covariant spectator wave functions and currents based on ``fixed-axis'' polarization states?,"  Addressing the recent criticisms of Kvinikhidze and Miller, we prove that the
spectator wave functions and currents based on ``fixed-axis'' polarization
states (previously introduced by us) are Lorentz covariant, and find an
explicit connection between them and conventional direction-dependent
polarization states. The discussion shows explicitly how it is possible to
construct pure $S$-wave models of the nucleon.
"
What are the chemical abundances of certain elements in the Galactic Center stars?,"  We present chemical abundances in a sample of luminous cool stars located
within 30 pc of the Galactic Center. Abundances of carbon, nitrogen, oxygen,
calcium, and iron were derived from high-resolution infrared spectra in the H-
and K-bands. The abundance results indicate that both [O/Fe] and [Ca/Fe] are
enhanced respectively by averages of +0.2 and +0.3 dex, relative to either the
Sun or the Milky Way disk at near solar Fe abundances. The Galactic Center
stars show a nearly uniform and nearly solar iron abundance. The mean value of
A(Fe) = 7.59 +- 0.06 agrees well with previous work. The total range in Fe
abundance among Galactic Center stars, 0.16 dex, is significantly narrower than
the iron abundance distributions found in the literature for the older bulge
population. Our snapshot of the current-day Fe abundance within 30 pc of the
Galactic Center samples stars with an age less than 1 Gyr; a larger sample in
time (or space) may find a wider spread in abundances.
"
What is the observed variation of the total cross section for the dp -> 3He eta reaction near threshold?,"  The observed variation of the total cross section for the dp -> 3He eta
reaction near threshold means that the magnitude of the s--wave amplitude falls
very rapidly with the eta centre--of--mass momentum. It is shown here that
recent measurements of the momentum dependence of the angular distribution
imply a strong variation also in the phase of this amplitude. Such a behaviour
is that expected from a quasi--bound or virtual eta-3He state. The
interpretation can be investigated further through measurements of the deuteron
or proton analysing powers and/or spin--correlations.

"What is the role of the ""pudding mold"" type in the large thermopower and the large conductivity in Na$_x$CoO$_2$?","  In the present study, we pin down the origin of the coexistence of the large
thermopower and the large conductivity in Na$_x$CoO$_2$. It is revealed that
not just the density of states (DOS), the effective mass, nor the band width,
but the peculiar {\it shape} of the $a_{1g}$ band referred to as the ""pudding
mold"" type, which consists of a dispersive portion and a somewhat flat portion,
is playing an important role in this phenomenon. The present study provides a
new guiding principle for designing good thermoelectric materials.
"
What is the relationship between the ion distribution and the electron beam in ion-clearing electrodes?,"  Here we compute the ion distribution produced by an electron beam when
ion-clearing electrodes are installed. This ion density is established as an
equilibrium between gas ionization and ion clearing. The transverse ion
distributions are shown to strongly peak in the beam's center, producing very
nonlinear forces on the electron beam. We will analyze perturbations to the
beam properties by these nonlinear fields. To obtain reasonable simulation
speeds, we develop fast algorithms that take advantage of adiabatic invariants
and scaling properties of Maxwell's equations and the Lorentz force.
  Our results are very relevant for high current Energy Recovery Linacs, where
ions are produced relatively quickly, and where clearing gaps in the electron
beam cannot easily be used for ion elimination. The examples in this paper
therefore use parameters of the Cornell Energy Recovery Linac project. For
simplicity we only consider the case of a circular electron beam of changing
diameter. However, we parameterize this model to approximate non-round beams
well. We find suitable places for clearing electrodes and compute the
equilibrium ion density and its effect on electron-emittance growth and halo
development. We find that it is not sufficient to place clearing electrodes
only at the minimum of the electron beam potential where ions are accumulated.
"
What is the relationship between the pitch of the MreB helix and the number of protofilaments in a single bacterium?,"  Within individual bacteria, we combine force-dependent polymerization
dynamics of individual MreB protofilaments with an elastic model of
protofilament bundles buckled into helical configurations. We use variational
techniques and stochastic simulations to relate the pitch of the MreB helix,
the total abundance of MreB, and the number of protofilaments. By comparing our
simulations with mean-field calculations, we find that stochastic fluctuations
are significant. We examine the quasi-static evolution of the helical pitch
with cell growth, as well as timescales of helix turnover and denovo
establishment. We find that while the body of a polarized MreB helix treadmills
towards its slow-growing end, the fast-growing tips of laterally associated
protofilaments move towards the opposite fast-growing end of the MreB helix.
This offers a possible mechanism for targeted polar localization without
cytoplasmic motor proteins.
"
What are the limitations of these techniques for measuring log g in late-type stars?,"  It is difficult to accurately measure the effective gravity (log g) in
late-type stars using broadband (eg. UBV or SDSS) or intermediate-band (uvby)
photometric systems, especially when the stars can cover a range of
metallicities and reddenings. However, simple spectroscopic observational and
data reduction techniques can yield accurate values for log g through
comparison of the Balmer jumps of low-resolution spectra with recent grids of
synthetic flux spectra.
"
"What is the nature of the phase transition in the vicinity of the quantum phase transition in the ""hyper-kagome"" lattice system Na$_4$Ir$_3$O$_8$?","  Recent experiments on the ""hyper-kagome"" lattice system Na$_4$Ir$_3$O$_8$
have demonstrated that it is a rare example of a three dimensional spin-1/2
frustrated antiferromagnet. We investigate the role of quantum fluctuations as
the primary mechanism lifting the macroscopic degeneracy inherited by classical
spins on this lattice. In the semi-classical limit we predict, based on large-N
calculations, that an unusual $\vec q=0$ coplaner magnetically ordered ground
state is stabilized with no local ""weather vane"" modes. This phase melts in the
quantum limit and a gapped topological Z$_2$ spin liquid phase emerges. In the
vicinity of this quantum phase transition, we study the dynamic spin structure
factor and comment on the relevance of our results for future neutron
scattering experiments.
"
"What is the quantum mechanical model used to describe Coulomb explosion of H$_2^+$ by short, intense, infrared laser pulses?","  We present a simple quantum mechanical model to describe Coulomb explosion of
H$_2^+$ by short, intense, infrared laser pulses. The model is based on the
length gauge version of the molecular strong-field approximation and is valid
for pulses shorter than 50 fs where the process of dissociation prior to
ionization is negligible. The results are compared with recent experimental
results for the proton energy spectrum [I. Ben-Itzhak et al., Phys. Rev. Lett.
95, 073002 (2005), B. D. Esry et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 97, 013003 (2006)]. The
predictions of the model reproduce the profile of the spectrum although the
peak energy is slightly lower than the observations. For comparison, we also
present results obtained by two different tunneling models for this process.
"
What are the possible explanations for the anomalies observed in the color-magnitude diagram of the Extreme Horizontal Branch stars?,"  We used the ESO VLT-FORS2 facility to collect low-resolution spectra of 51
targets distributed along the Horizontal Branch. We determined atmospheric
parameters by comparison with theoretical models through standard fitting
routines, and masses by basic equations. Results are in general in good
agreement with previous works, although not always with theoretical
expectations for cooler stars (Teff<15000 K). The calculated color excess is
systematically lower than literature values, pointing towards a possible
underestimation of effective temperatures. Moreover, we find two groups of
stars at Teff=14000 K and at Teff=27000$ K that present anomalies with respect
to the general trend and expectations. We suppose that the three peculiar
bright stars at Teff=14000 K are probably affected by an enhanced stellar wind.
For the eight Extreme Horizontal Branch stars at Teff=27000 K which show
unusually high masses we find no plausible explanation. While most of our
results agree well with the predictions of standard horizontal branch
evolution, we still have problems with the low masses we derive in certain
temperature ranges. We believe that Kurucz ATLAS9 LTE model atmospheres with
solar-scaled abundances are probably inadequate for these temperature ranges.
Concerning the group of anomalous stars at Teff=27000 K, a Kolmogorov-Smirnov
test indicates that there is only an 8.4% probability that these stars are
randomly drawn from the general distribution in the color-magnitude diagram.
This is not conclusive but points out that these stars could be both (and
independently) spectroscopically and photometrically peculiar with respect to
the general Extreme Horizontal Branch population.
"
What is the time-dependent extension of the generator coordinate (GC) method?,"  The generator coordinate (GC) method is a variational approach to the quantum
many-body problem in which interacting many-body wave functions are constructed
as superpositions of (generally nonorthogonal) eigenstates of auxiliary
Hamiltonians containing a deformation parameter. This paper presents a
time-dependent extension of the GC method as a new approach to improve existing
approximations of the exchange-correlation (XC) potential in time-dependent
density-functional theory (TDDFT). The time-dependent GC method is shown to be
a conceptually and computationally simple tool to build memory effects into any
existing adiabatic XC potential. As an illustration, the method is applied to
driven parametric oscillations of two interacting electrons in a harmonic
potential (Hooke's atom). It is demonstrated that a proper choice of
time-dependent generator coordinates in conjunction with the adiabatic
local-density approximation reproduces the exact linear and nonlinear
two-electron dynamics quite accurately, including features associated with
double excitations that cannot be captured by TDDFT in the adiabatic
approximation.
"
What are the fast-magnetosonic modes in an anisotropic cosmological model?,"  The excitation of cosmological perturbations in an anisotropic cosmological
model and in the presence of a homogeneous magnetic field was studied, using
the resistive magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations. We have shown that
fast-magnetosonic modes, propagating normal to the magnetic field grow
exponentially and saturated at high values, due to the resistivity. We also
demonstrate that the jeans-like instabilities are enhanced inside a resistive
and the formation of condensations formed within an anisotropic fluid influence
the growing magnetosonic waves.
"
How does the slope of the onset temperature change as the upper critical field increases?,"  We use the phenomenological model proposed in our previous paper [Phys. Rev.
Lett. {\bf 98}, 237001 (2007)] to analyse the magnetic field dependence of the
onset temperature for two-dimensional fluctuating superconductivity $T^{**}
(H)$. We demonstrate that the slope of $T^{**} (H)$ progressively goes down as
$H$ increases, such that the upper critical field progressively increases as
$T$ decreases. The quantitative agreement with the recent measurements of
$T^{**} (H)$ in $La_{1.85}Ba_{0.125}CuO_4$ is achieved for the same parameter
value as was derived in our previous publication from the analysis of the
electron self energy.
"
What are the implications of the nonlocality of NCQFT for the twisted Poincaré symmetry?,"  The concept of twisted Poincar\'e symmetry, as well as some implications, are
reviewed. The spin-statistics relation and the nonlocality of NC QFT are
discussed in the light of this quantum symmetry. The possibility of a twisted
symmetry principle for quantum field and gauge theories formulated on a
noncommutative space-time is also explored.
"
What are the implications of the global asymptotic stability for the systems considered in this paper?,"  We consider a class of nonlinear differential equations that arises in the
study of chemical reaction systems that are known to be locally asymptotically
stable and prove that they are in fact globally asymptotically stable. More
specifically, we will consider chemical reaction systems that are weakly
reversible, have a deficiency of zero, and are equipped with mass action
kinetics. We show that if for each $c \in \R_{> 0}^m$ the intersection of the
stoichiometric compatibility class $c + S$ with the subsets on the boundary
that could potentially contain equilibria, $L_W$, are at most discrete, then
global asymptotic stability follows. Previous global stability results for the
systems considered in this paper required $(c + S) \cap L_W = \emptyset$ for
each $c \in \R^m_{> 0}$, and so this paper can be viewed as an extension of
those works.
"
Can gauge theories be broken by the zero mode for the direction of the extra dimension?,"  We study gauge theories with/without an extra dimension at finite
temperature, in which there are two kinds of order parameters of gauge symmetry
breaking. The one is the zero mode of the gauge field for the Euclidean time
direction and the other is that for the direction of the extra dimension. We
evaluate the effective potential for the zero modes in one-loop approximation
and investigate the vacuum configuration in detail. Our analyses show that
gauge symmetry can be broken only through the zero mode for the direction of
the extra dimension and no nontrivial vacuum configuration of the zero mode for
the Euclidean time direction is found.
"
What are the unitary groups of nonisomorphic torsion-free Abelian $C^*$-algebras?,"  We study to what extent group $C^\ast$-algebras are characterized by their
unitary groups. A complete characterization of which Abelian group
$C^\ast$-algebras have isomorphic unitary groups is obtained. We compare these
results with other unitary-related invariants of $C^\ast(\Gamma)$, such as the
$K$-theoretic $K_1(C^\ast(\Gamma))$ and find that $C^\ast$-algebras of
nonisomorphic torsion-free Abelian groups may have isomorphic $K_1$-groups, in
sharp contrast with the well-known fact that $C^\ast(\Gamma)$ (even $\Gamma$)
is characterized by the topological group structure of its unitary group when
$\Gamma $ is torsion-free and Abelian.
"
Can axion-like particles be used for long-distance communication?,"  The possible existence of axion-like particles could lead to a new type of
long distance communication. In this work, basic antenna concepts are defined
and a Friis-like equation is derived to facilitate long-distance link
calculations. An example calculation is presented showing that communication
over distances of 1000 km or more may be possible for $m_{a}< 3.5$ meV and
$g_{a\gamma \gamma} > 5 \times 10^{- 8} {\text{GeV}}^{- 1}$.
"
What are the data accumulated by the HERMES experiment?,"  The first direct measurement of p_t-broadening effects in cold nuclear matter
has been studied as a function of several kinematic variables for different
hadron types. The data have been accumulated by the HERMES experiment at DESY,
in which the HERA 27.6 GeV lepton beam scattered off several nuclear gas
targets.
"
What are the main developments in the theory of the nucleus based on the chiral effective field theory?,"  A survey is given of the evolution from Yukawa's early work, via the
understanding of the pion as a Nambu-Goldstone boson of spontaneously broken
chiral symmetry in QCD, to modern developments in the theory of the nucleus
based on the chiral effective field theory representing QCD in its low-energy
limit.
"
"How does the IR luminosity function evolve with redshift, and what are the implications for the population of LIRGs and ULIRGs?","  We present the IR luminosity function derived from ultra-deep 70 micron
imaging of the GOODS-North field. The 70 micron observations are longward of
the PAH and silicate features which complicate work in the MIR. We derive
far-infrared luminosities for the 143 sources with S_{70} > 2 mJy (S/N > 3
\sigma). The majority (81%) of the sources have spectroscopic redshifts, and
photometric redshifts are calculated for the remainder. The IR luminosity
function at four redshifts (z ~ 0.28, 0.48, 0.78, and 0.97) is derived and
compared to the local one. There is considerable degeneracy between luminosity
and density evolution. If the evolving luminosity function is described as
\rho(L, z) = (1 + z)^q \rho(L/(1 + z)^p, 0), we find q = -2.19p + 6.09. In the
case of pure luminosity evolution, we find a best fit of p =
2.78^{+0.34}_{-0.32}. This is consistent with the results from 24 micron and
1.4 GHz studies. Our results confirm the emerging picture of strong evolution
in LIRGs and ULIRGs at 0.4 < z < 1.1, but we find no evidence of significant
evolution in the sub-LIRG (L < 10^{11} L_{\odot}) population for z < 0.4.
"
What is the Nash equilibrium solution for the game-theoretic model of joint power and rate control in multiple-access networks?,"  A game-theoretic model is proposed to study the cross-layer problem of joint
power and rate control with quality of service (QoS) constraints in
multiple-access networks. In the proposed game, each user seeks to choose its
transmit power and rate in a distributed manner in order to maximize its own
utility while satisfying its QoS requirements. The user's QoS constraints are
specified in terms of the average source rate and an upper bound on the average
delay where the delay includes both transmission and queuing delays. The
utility function considered here measures energy efficiency and is particularly
suitable for wireless networks with energy constraints. The Nash equilibrium
solution for the proposed non-cooperative game is derived and a closed-form
expression for the utility achieved at equilibrium is obtained. It is shown
that the QoS requirements of a user translate into a ""size"" for the user which
is an indication of the amount of network resources consumed by the user. Using
this competitive multiuser framework, the tradeoffs among throughput, delay,
network capacity and energy efficiency are studied. In addition, analytical
expressions are given for users' delay profiles and the delay performance of
the users at Nash equilibrium is quantified.
"
What is the discrepancy between theoretical models and observations of dust formation in supernovae ejecta?,"  The presence of dust at high redshift requires efficient condensation of
grains in SN ejecta, in accordance with current theoretical models. Yet,
observations of the few well studied SNe and SN remnants imply condensation
efficiencies which are about two orders of magnitude smaller. Motivated by this
tension, we have (i) revisited the model of Todini & Ferrara (2001) for dust
formation in the ejecta of core collapse SNe and (ii) followed, for the first
time, the evolution of newly condensed grains from the time of formation to
their survival - through the passage of the reverse shock - in the SN remnant.
We find that 0.1 - 0.6 M_sun of dust form in the ejecta of 12 - 40 M_sun
stellar progenitors. Depending on the density of the surrounding ISM, between
2-20% of the initial dust mass survives the passage of the reverse shock, on
time-scales of about 4-8 x 10^4 yr from the stellar explosion. Sputtering by
the hot gas induces a shift of the dust size distribution towards smaller
grains. The resulting dust extinction curve shows a good agreement with that
derived by observations of a reddened QSO at z =6.2. Stochastic heating of
small grains leads to a wide distribution of dust temperatures. This supports
the idea that large amounts (~ 0.1 M_sun) of cold dust (T ~ 40K) can be present
in SN remnants, without being in conflict with the observed IR emission.
"
What are the implications of the paradox in a would be twin or clock on a local scale?,"  After pointing out the historical avatar at the origin of a would be twin or
clock paradox, we argue that, at least on a local scale, the (re-qualified)
paradox is but a necessary consequence of the sole principle of causality.
"
What are the characteristics of the network structures that evolve from a power-law to an exponential degree distribution?,"  We study a modified version of a model previously proposed by Jackson and
Wolinsky to account for communicating information and allocating goods in
socioeconomic networks. In the model, the utility function of each node is
given by a weighted sum of contributions from all accessible nodes. The
weights, parameterized by the variable $\delta$, decrease with distance. We
introduce a growth mechanism where new nodes attach to the existing network
preferentially by utility. By increasing $\delta$, the network structure
evolves from a power-law to an exponential degree distribution, passing through
a regime characterised by shorter average path length, lower degree
assortativity and higher central point dominance. In the second part of the
paper we compare different network structures in terms of the average utility
received by each node. We show that power-law networks provide higher average
utility than Poisson random networks. This provides a possible justification
for the ubiquitousness of scale-free networks in the real world.
"
What is the Natural Language Understanding and Reasoning for Intelligence framework?,"  This research hypothesized that a practical approach in the form of a
solution framework known as Natural Language Understanding and Reasoning for
Intelligence (NaLURI), which combines full-discourse natural language
understanding, powerful representation formalism capable of exploiting
ontological information and reasoning approach with advanced features, will
solve the following problems without compromising practicality factors: 1)
restriction on the nature of question and response, and 2) limitation to scale
across domains and to real-life natural language text.
"
What is the probability of photon merging in a high-energy proton beam and a strong laser field?,"  In the collision of a high-energy proton beam and a strong laser field,
merging of the laser photons can occur due to the polarization of vacuum. The
probability of photon merging is calculated by accounting exactly for the laser
field and presents a highly non-perturbative dependence on the laser intensity
and frequency. It is shown that the non-perturbative vacuum-polarization
effects can be experimentally measured by combining the next-generation of
table-top petawatt lasers with presently available proton accelerators.
"
What is the global strong solution of the subquartic wave equation on the 3D sphere?,"  We prove that the subquartic wave equation on the three dimensional ball
$\Theta$, with Dirichlet boundary conditions admits global strong solutions for
a large set of random supercritical initial data in $\cap_{s<1/2} H^s(\Theta)$.
We obtain this result as a consequence of a general random data Cauchy theory
for supercritical wave equations developed in our previous work \cite{BT2} and
invariant measure considerations which allow us to obtain also precise large
time dynamical informations on our solutions.
"
What is the inverse problem known as electrical impedance tomography?,"  This paper is devoted to the analysis of a second order method for recovering
the \emph{a priori} unknown shape of an inclusion $\omega$ inside a body
$\Omega$ from boundary measurement. This inverse problem - known as electrical
impedance tomography - has many important practical applications and hence has
focussed much attention during the last years. However, to our best knowledge,
no work has yet considered a second order approach for this problem. This paper
aims to fill that void: we investigate the existence of second order derivative
of the state $u$ with respect to perturbations of the shape of the interface
$\partial\omega$, then we choose a cost function in order to recover the
geometry of $\partial \omega$ and derive the expression of the derivatives
needed to implement the corresponding Newton method. We then investigate the
stability of the process and explain why this inverse problem is severely
ill-posed by proving the compactness of the Hessian at the global minimizer.
"
What is the explicit formula for the toric variety coordinates in terms of the reduced phase space coordinates?,"  In this note we describe the natural coordinatizations of a Delzant space
defined as a reduced phase space (symplectic geometry view-point) and give
explicit formulas for the coordinate transformations. For each fixed point of
the torus action on the Delzant polytope, we have a maximal coordinatization of
an open cell in the Delzant space which contains the fixed point. This cell is
equal to the domain of definition of one of the natural coordinatizations of
the Delzant space as a toric variety (complex algebraic geometry view-point),
and we give an explicit formula for the toric variety coordinates in terms of
the reduced phase space coordinates. We use considerations in the maximal
coordinate neighborhoods to give simple proofs of some of the basic facts about
the Delzant space, as a reduced phase space, and as a toric variety. These can
be viewed as a first application of the coordinatizations, and serve to make
the presentation more self-contained.
"
What is the relation between the inner products of the quantum Hilbert spaces of the symplectic quotient and the original space?,"  Let $M$ be a connected compact quantizable K\""ahler manifold equipped with a
Hamiltonian action of a connected compact Lie group $G$. Let
$M//G=\phi^{-1}(0)/G=M_0$ be the symplectic quotient at value 0 of the moment
map $\phi$. The space $M_0$ may in general not be smooth. It is known that, as
vector spaces, there is a natural isomorphism between the quantum Hilbert space
over $M_0$ and the $G$-invariant subspace of the quantum Hilbert space over
$M$. In this paper, without any regularity assumption on the quotient $M_0$, we
discuss the relation between the inner products of these two quantum Hilbert
spaces under the above natural isomorphism; we establish asymptotic unitarity
to leading order in Planck's constant of a modified map of the above
isomorphism under a ``metaplectic correction'' of the two quantum Hilbert
spaces.
"
What are the spin-flavor singlet component of the masses with respect to the angular momentum?,"  We analyze Regge trajectories in terms of the $1/N_c$ expansion of QCD.
Neglecting spin-orbit contributions to the large $N_c$ baryon mass operator, we
consider the evolution of the spin-flavor singlet component of the masses with
respect to the angular momentum. We find two distinct and remarkably linear
Regge trajectories for symmetric and for mixed symmetric spin-flavor
multiplets.
"
How does the orientation of the magnetic field relative to the galactic plane affect the rise of the hot gas bubble?,"  In order to determine the circumstances under which isolated SNRs are capable
of rising into and enriching the thick disk and galactic halo, simulations of
supernova remnants are performed with the FLASH magnetohydrodynamic code. We
performed simulations in which the interstellar magnetic field is parallel to
or perpendicular to the galactic plane as well as a simulation without a
magnetic field. The ambient gas density distribution and gravitational
potential are based on observations of our galaxy. We evolve the remnants to
ages of roughly 10,000,000 years. For our simulation without a magnetic field,
we compare the evolution of the hot bubble's velocity with the velocity
evolution calculated from the buoyant and drag accelerations. We found
surprisingly small vertical velocities of the hot gas, from which we estimated
the drag coefficient to be ten for the non-magnetic simulation. Although we
found little buoyant motion of the hot gas during the remnant's lifetime, we
found rapid vertical motion of the associated cool dense gas near the end of
the remnants life. This motion deformed the remnant into a mushroom cloud
structure similar to those found in previous simulations. The simulation in
which we have a 4 micro-Gauss magnetic field parallel to the galactic mid-plane
shows a dramatically elongated bubble parallel to the magnetic field. The
magnetic field pins the supernova remnant preventing it from rising. In the
simulation with the 4 micro-Gauss magnetic field perpendicular to the midplane
the hot bubble rises more, indicating that having the magnetic field in the
same direction as the gravitational force enhances the rise of the bubble.
"
What is the generalization of Poisson-Nijenhuis algebroids that includes Jacobi and Jacobi-Nijenhuis algebroids?,"  Jacobi-Nijenhuis algebroids are defined as a natural generalization of
Poisson-Nijenhuis algebroids, in the case where there exists a Nijenhuis
operator on a Jacobi algebroid which is compatible with it. We study modular
classes of Jacobi and Jacobi-Nijenhuis algebroids.
"
How does the adaptive state of cells with a higher growth speed affect the selection of cellular states?,"  How can a microorganism adapt to a variety of environmental conditions
despite there exists a limited number of signal transduction machineries? We
show that for any growing cells whose gene expression is under stochastic
fluctuations, adaptive cellular state is inevitably selected by noise, even
without specific signal transduction network for it. In general, changes in
protein concentration in a cell are given by its synthesis minus dilution and
degradation, both of which are proportional to the rate of cell growth. In an
adaptive state with a higher growth speed, both terms are large and balanced.
Under the presence of noise in gene expression, the adaptive state is less
affected by stochasticity since both the synthesis and dilution terms are
large, while for a non-adaptive state both the terms are smaller so that cells
are easily kicked out of the original state by noise. Hence, escape time from a
cellular state and the cellular growth rate are negatively correlated. This
leads to a selection of adaptive states with higher growth rates, and model
simulations confirm this selection to take place in general. The results
suggest a general form of adaptation that has never been brought to light - a
process that requires no specific machineries for sensory adaptation. The
present scheme may help explain a wide range of cellular adaptive responses
including the metabolic flux optimization for maximal cell growth.
"
What are the properties of simple rank 6 vector bundles on P^3 with Chern polynomial 1+3t+6t^2+4t^3?,"  We study the moduli space $\fM^s(6;3,6,4)$ of simple rank 6 vector bundles
$\E$ on $\PP^3$ with Chern polynomial $1+3t+6t^2+4t^3$ and properties of these
bundles, especially we prove some partial results concerning their stability.
We first recall how these bundles are related to the construction of sextic
nodal surfaces in $\PP^3$ having an even set of 56 nodes (cf. \cite{CaTo}). We
prove that there is an open set, corresponding to the simple bundles with
minimal cohomology, which is irreducible of dimension 19 and bimeromorphic to
an open set $\fA^0$ of the G.I.T. quotient space of the projective space
$\fB:=\{B\in \PP(U^\vee\otimes W\otimes V^\vee)\}$ of triple tensors of type
$(3,3,4)$ by the natural action of $SL(W)\times SL(U)$. We give several
constructions for these bundles, which relate them to cubic surfaces in 3-space
$\PP^3$ and to cubic surfaces in the dual space $(\PP^3)^{\vee}$. One of these
constructions, suggested by Igor Dolgachev, generalizes to other types of
tensors. Moreover, we relate the socalled {\em cross-product involution} for
$(3,3,4)$-tensors, introduced in \cite{CaTo}, with the Schur quadric associated
to a cubic surface in $\PP^3$ and study further properties of this involution.
"
How does the binding neuron model differ from the Hodgkin-Huxley-type point neuron and the leaky integrate-and-fire model?,"  The binding neuron model is inspired by numerical simulation of
Hodgkin-Huxley-type point neuron, as well as by the leaky integrate-and-fire
model. In the binding neuron, the trace of an input is remembered for a fixed
period of time after which it disappears completely. This is in the contrast
with the above two models, where the postsynaptic potentials decay
exponentially and can be forgotten only after triggering. The finiteness of
memory in the binding neuron allows one to construct fast recurrent networks
for computer modeling. Recently, the finiteness is utilized for exact
mathematical description of the output stochastic process if the binding neuron
is driven with the Poissonian input stream. In this paper, the simplest
networking is considered for binding neuron. Namely, it is expected that every
output spike of single neuron is immediately fed into its input. For this
construction, externally fed with Poissonian stream, the output stream is
characterized in terms of interspike interval probability density distribution
if the binding neuron has threshold 2. For higher thresholds, the distribution
is calculated numerically. The distributions are compared with those found for
binding neuron without feedback, and for leaky integrator. Sample distributions
for leaky integrator with feedback are calculated numerically as well. It is
oncluded that even the simplest networking can radically alter spikng
statistics. Information condensation at the level of single neuron is
discussed.
"
What is the role of doping in the formation of holes in the out-of-plane orbitals of La(2-x)Sr(x)CuO4?,"  Ab-initio density functional calculations on explicitly doped
La(2-x)Sr(x)CuO4 find doping creates localized holes in out-of-plane orbitals.
A model for superconductivity is developed based on the assumption that doping
leads to the formation of holes on a four-site Cu plaquette composed of the
out-of-plane A1 orbitals apical O pz, planar Cu dz2, and planar O psigma. This
is in contrast to the assumption of hole doping into planar Cu dx2-y2 and O
psigma orbitals as in the t-J model. Interaction of holes with the d9 spin
background leads to chiral polarons with either a clockwise or anti-clockwise
charge current. When the polaron plaquettes percolate through the crystal at
x~0.05 for LaSrCuO, a Cu dx2-y2 and planar O psigma band is formed. Spin
exchange Coulomb repulsion with chiral polarons leads to D-wave
superconductivity. The equivalent of the Debye energy in phonon
superconductivity is the maximum energy separation between a chiral polaron and
its time-reversed partner. An additive skew-scattering contribution to the Hall
effect is induced by chiral polarons and leads to a temperature dependent Hall
effect that fits the measured values for LaSrCuO. The integrated imaginary
susceptibility satisfies omega/T scaling due to chirality and spin-flip
scattering of polarons along with a uniform distribution of polaron energy
splittings. The derived functional form is compatible with experiments. The
static spin structure factor is computed and is incommensurate with a
separation distance from (pi,pi) given by ~(2pi)x. Coulomb scattering of the
x2-y2 band with polarons leads to linear resistivity. Coupling of the x2-y2
band to the undoped Cu d9 spins leads to the ARPES pseudogap and its doping and
temperature dependence.

What is the relationship between submillimetre-bright and submillimetre-faint BzKs?,"  We have studied the submillimetre (submm) properties of the following classes
of near-infrared (NIR)-selected massive galaxies at high redshifts:
BzK-selected star-forming galaxies (BzKs); distant red galaxies (DRGs); and
extremely red objects (EROs). We used the SCUBA HAlf Degree Extragalactic
Survey (SHADES), the largest uniform submm survey to date. Partial overlap of
SIRIUS/NIR images and SHADES in SXDF has allowed us to identify 4 submm-bright
NIR-selected galaxies, which are detected in the mid-infrared, 24 micron, and
the radio, 1.4 GHz. We find that all of our submm-bright NIR-selected galaxies
satisfy the BzK selection criteria, except for one galaxy whose B-z and z-K
colours are however close to the BzK colour boundary. Two of the submm-bright
NIR-selected galaxies satisfy all of the selection criteria we considered, i.e.
they belong to the BzK-DRG-ERO overlapping population, or `extremely red' BzKs.
Although these extremely red BzKs are rare (0.25 arcmin^{-2}), up to 20 % of
this population could be submm galaxies. This fraction is significantly higher
than that found for other galaxy populations studied here. Via a stacking
analysis, we have detected the 850 micron flux of submm-faint BzKs and EROs in
our SCUBA maps. While the contribution of z~2 BzKs to the submm background is
about 10--15 % and similar to that from EROs typically at z~1, BzKs have a
higher fraction (~30 %) of submm flux in resolved sources compared with EROs
and submm sources as a whole. From the SED fitting analysis for both
submm-bright and submm-faint BzKs, we found no clear signature that
submm-bright BzKs are experiencing a specifically luminous evolutionary phase,
compared with submm-faint BzKs. An alternative explanation might be that
submm-bright BzKs are more massive than submm-faint ones.
"
What are the two branches of solutions to the 5D gravity problem?,"  A brief introduction is given to the subject of brane induced gravity. The 5D
example is discussed in detail. The 4D laws of gravity are obtained on a brane
embedded in an infinite volume extra space, where the problem of stabilization
of the volume modulus is absent. The theory has two classically disjoint
branches of solutions -- the conventional and self-accelerated one. The
conventional branch gives a perturbatively stable model of a metastable
graviton, with potentially testable predictions within the Solar system. The
self-accelerated branch, on the other hand, provides an existence proof for an
idea that the accelerated expansion of the Universe could be due to modified
gravity. The issue of perturbative stability of the self-accelerated branch is
obscured by a breakdown of the conventional perturbative expansion. However, a
certain exact non-perturbative solution found in hep-th/0612016 exhibits a net
negative gravitational mass, while this mass is positive on the conventional
branch. This suggest that the self-accelerated solution must be
non-perturbatively unstable. A proposal to overcome this problem in an
extension of the original model, that also allows for the quantum gravity scale
to be unrestricted, is briefly discussed.

"What are the new structure of the Magnus and Fer expansion, and the language of dendriform and pre-Lie algebras?","  We provide a refined approach to the classical Magnus and Fer expansion,
unveiling a new structure by using the language of dendriform and pre-Lie
algebras. The recursive formula for the logarithm of the solutions of the
equations X=1+ta<X and Y=1-tY> a in A[[t]] is provided, where (A,<,>) is a
dendriform algebra. Then, we present the solutions to these equations as an
infinite product expansion of exponentials. Both formulae involve the pre-Lie
product naturally associated with the dendriform structure. Several
applications are presented.
"
What is the interpretation of the CMa overdensity in the context of the Galaxy?,"  We perform a critical re-analysis and discussion of recent results presented
in the literature which interpret the CMa overdensity as the signature of an
accreting dwarf galaxy or a new substructure within the Galaxy. Several issues
are addressed. We show that arguments against the ``warp'' interpretation are
based on an erroneous perception of the Milky Way. There is nothing anomalous
with colour--magnitude diagrams on opposite sides of the average warp mid-plane
being different. We witnessed the rise and fall of the blue plume population,
first attributed to young stars in a disrupting dwarf galaxy and now discarded
as a normal disc population. Similarly, there is nothing anomalous in the outer
thin+thick disc metallicities being low (-1<[Fe/H]<-0.5), and spiral arms (as
part of the thin disc) should, and do, warp. Most importantly, we show
unambiguously that, contrary to previous claims, the warp produces a stellar
overdensity that is distance-compatible with that observed in CMa.The CMa
over-density remains fully accounted for in a first order approach by Galactic
models without new substructures. Given the intrinsic uncertainties (concerning
the properties of the warp, flare and disc cutoff, the role of extinction and
degeneracy), minor deviations with respect to these models are not enough to
support the hypothesis of an accreted dwarf galaxy or new substructure within
the Milky Way disc.
"
What is the application of the algorithm for other fields?,"  We introduce a stochastic algorithm that acts as a prime number generator.
The dynamics of such algorithm gives rise to a continuous phase transition
which separates a phase where the algorithm is able to reduce a whole set of
integers into primes and a phase where the system reaches a frozen state with
low prime density. We present both numerical simulations and an analytical
approach in terms of an annealed approximation, by means of which the data are
collapsed. A critical slowing down phenomenon is also outlined.
"
What is the behavior of the yield ratio for B and D pairs near their respective thresholds in e+e- annihilation?,"  We revisit the problem of interplay between the strong and the Coulomb
interaction in the charged-to-neutral yield ratio for $B {\bar B}$ and $D {\bar
D}$ pairs near their respective thresholds in $e^+e^-$ annihilation. We
consider here a realistic situation with a resonant interaction in the isospin
I=0 channel and a nonresonant strong scattering amplitude in the I=1 state. We
find that the yield ratio has a smooth behavior depending on the scattering
phase in the I=1 channel. The same approach is also applicable to the $K {\bar
K}$ production at the $\phi(1020)$ resonance, where the Coulomb effect in the
charged-to-neutral yield ratio is generally sensitive to the scattering phases
in both the isoscalar and the isovector channels. Furthermore, we apply the
same approach to the treatment of the effect of the isotopic mass difference
between the charged and neutral mesons and argue that the strong-scattering
effects generally result in a modification to the pure kinematical effect of
this mass difference.
"
What is the Bayesian estimation approach proposed for hyperspectral image analysis?,"  Hyperspectral images can be represented either as a set of images or as a set
of spectra. Spectral classification and segmentation and data reduction are the
main problems in hyperspectral image analysis. In this paper we propose a
Bayesian estimation approach with an appropriate hiearchical model with hidden
markovian variables which gives the possibility to jointly do data reduction,
spectral classification and image segmentation. In the proposed model, the
desired independent components are piecewise homogeneous images which share the
same common hidden segmentation variable. Thus, the joint Bayesian estimation
of this hidden variable as well as the sources and the mixing matrix of the
source separation problem gives a solution for all the three problems of
dimensionality reduction, spectra classification and segmentation of
hyperspectral images. A few simulation results illustrate the performances of
the proposed method compared to other classical methods usually used in
hyperspectral image processing.
"
What are the masses and semileptonic decay widths for doubly heavy Xi and Omega baryons in the framework of a nonrelativistic quark model?,"  We evaluate masses and semileptonic decay widths for the ground state of
doubly heavy $\Xi$ and $\Omega$ baryons in the framework of a nonrelativistic
quark model. We solve the three-body problem by means of a variational ansatz
made possible by heavy-quark spin symmetry constraints. Our masses are
comparable to the ones obtained in relativistic calculations and we get one of
the best agreements with lattice data. Our simple wave functions are used to
evaluate semileptonic decays of doubly heavy $\Xi, \Xi'(J=1/2)$ and $\Omega,
\Omega'(J=1/2)$ baryons. Our results for the decay widths are in reasonable
agreement with calculations done in a relativistic calculation in the
quark-diquark approximation. We also check that our wave functions comply with
what it is expected in the infinite heavy quark mass limit.
"
What is the relationship between the Lefschetz property of an ideal and the reverse lexicographic order of its generators?,"  Let $I$ be a homogeneous Artinian ideal in a polynomial ring
$R=k[x_1,...,x_n]$ over a field $k$ of characteristic 0. We study an equivalent
condition for the generic initial ideal $\gin(I)$ with respect to reverse
lexicographic order to be almost reverse lexicographic. As a result, we show
that Moreno-Socias conjecture implies Fr\""{o}berg conjecture. And for the case
$\Codim I \le 3$, we show that $R/I$ has the strong Lefschetz property if and
only if $\gin(I)$ is almost reverse lexicographic. Finally for a monomial
complete intersection Artinian ideal $I=(x_1^{d_1},...,x_n^{d_n})$, we prove
that $\gin(I)$ is almost reverse lexicographic if $d_i > \sum_{j=1}^{i-1} d_j -
i + 1$ for each $i \ge 4$. Using this, we give a positive partial answer to
Moreno-Socias conjecture, and to Fr\""{o}berg conjecture.
"
What are the implications of the current data for the exotic hadron identification?,"  It is proposed that fragmentation functions should be used to identify exotic
hadrons. As an example, fragmentation functions of the scalar meson f_0(980)
are investigated. It is pointed out that the second moments and functional
forms of the u- and s-quark fragmentation functions can distinguish the
tetraquark structure from $q\bar q$. By the global analysis of f_0 (980)
production data in electron-positron annihilation, its fragmentation functions
and their uncertainties are determined. It is found that the current available
data are not sufficient to determine its internal structure, while precise data
in future should be able to identify exotic quark configurations.
"
What is the phenomenon observed in the Brillouin zone at low-energy?,"  The magnetic spectrum at high-energies in heavily underdoped
YBa$_{2}$Cu$_{3}$O$_{6.35}$ (T$_{c}$=18 K) has been determined throughout the
Brillouin zone. At low-energy the scattering forms a cone of spin excitations
emanating from the antiferromagnetic (0.5, 0.5) wave vector with an acoustic
velocity similar to that of insulating cuprates. At high energy transfers,
below the maximum energy of 270 meV at (0.5, 0), we observe zone boundary
dispersion much larger and spectral weight loss more extensive than in
insulating antiferromagnets. Moreover we report phenomena not found in
insulators, an overall lowering of the zone-boundary energies and a large
damping of $\sim$ 100 meV of the spin excitations at high-energies. The energy
above which the damping occurs coincides approximately with the gap determined
from transport measurements. We propose that as the energy is raised the spin
excitations encounter an extra channel of decay into particle-hole pairs of a
continuum that we associate with the pseudogap.
"
What are the particles that carry the current in a Fermi gas?,"  Atom and molecule currents in a Fermi gas in the neighborhood of a Feshbach
resonance are studied in a one-dimensional optical ring lattice by directly
diagonalizing small models. A rotational analogy of flux quantization is used
to show that fraction of the current is carried by particles with twice the
mass of an atom, which suggests pairing and superfluidity.
"
What are the accuracy of the current quantization of the quantized current in the GHz range?,"  A quantum coherent capacitor subject to large amplitude pulse cycles can be
made to emit or reabsorb an electron in each half cycle. Quantized currents
with pulse cycles in the GHz range have been demonstrated experimentally. We
develop a non-linear dynamical scattering theory for arbitrary pulses to
describe the properties of this very fast single electron source. Using our
theory we analyze the accuracy of the current quantization and investigate the
noise of such a source. Our results are important for future scientific and
possible metrological applications of this source.
"
What is the spin-state quasidegeneracy of Co^{3+} ions in oxides?,"  Recently, strong reduction of the quasiparticle peaks and pronounced
incoherent structures have been observed in the photoemission spectra of
layered cobaltates. Surprisingly, these many-body effects are found to increase
near the band insulator regime. We explain these unexpected observations in
terms of a novel spin-polaron model for CoO_2 planes which is based on a fact
of the spin-state quasidegeneracy of Co^{3+} ions in oxides. Scattering of the
photoholes on spin-state fluctuations suppresses their coherent motion. The
observed ``peak-dip-hump'' type lineshapes are well reproduced by the theory.
"
What are the implications of the diffusive scale on scalar correlations in passive scalar turbulence?,"  Passive scalar turbulence forced steadily is characterized by the velocity
correlation scale, $L$, injection scale, $l$, and diffusive scale, $r_d$. The
scales are well separated if the diffusivity is small, $r_d\ll l,L$, and one
normally says that effects of diffusion are confined to smaller scales, $r\ll
r_d$. However, if the velocity is single scale one finds that a weak dependence
of the scalar correlations on the molecular diffusivity persists to even larger
scales, e.g. $l\gg r\gg r_d$ \cite{95BCKL}. We consider the case of $L\gg l$
and report a counter-intuitive result -- the emergence of a new range of large
scales, $L\gg r\gg l^2/r_d$, where the diffusivity shows a strong effect on
scalar correlations.
"
What are the eigenvalues of the Sturm-Liouville problem?,"  We consider a regular indefinite Sturm-Liouville problem with two
self-adjoint boundary conditions affinely dependent on the eigenparameter. We
give sufficient conditions under which the root vectors of this Sturm-Liouville
problem can be selected to form a Riesz basis of a corresponding weighted
Hilbert space.
"
What is the relationship between the heavy-light ansatz and the many-body problem in terms of single-particle orbitals?,"  The symmetric heavy-light ansatz is a method for finding the ground state of
any dilute unpolarized system of attractive two-component fermions.
Operationally it can be viewed as a generalization of the Kohn-Sham equations
in density functional theory applied to N-body density correlations. While the
original Hamiltonian has an exact Z_2 symmetry, the heavy-light ansatz breaks
this symmetry by skewing the mass ratio of the two components. In the limit
where one component is infinitely heavy, the many-body problem can be solved in
terms of single-particle orbitals. The original Z_2 symmetry is recovered by
enforcing Z_2 symmetry as a constraint on N-body density correlations for the
two components. For the 1D, 2D, and 3D attractive Hubbard models the method is
in very good agreement with exact Lanczos calculations for few-body systems at
arbitrary coupling. For the 3D attractive Hubbard model there is very good
agreement with lattice Monte Carlo results for many-body systems in the limit
of infinite scattering length.

"In conclusion, the microwave photovoltage technique allows us to measure the quantized spin excitations in a single ferromagnetic microstrip with a high degree","  This paper has been withdrawn by the authors.
"
What are the effective potentials for quark-antiquark pairs in quarkonium?,"  Using methods previously developed by Kelbg and others for creating effective
potentials for electron-ion plasmas, we investigate quarkonium potentials above
deconfinement. Using results for the internal energy of a static
quark-antiquark pair, a set of effective potentials are constructed that take
into account quantum effects and symmetry conditions. Bound state effects are
explicitly included in order to account for the strongly coupled nature of
plasmas. It is hoped that these effective potentials will be useful in
simulations of heavy quarks or plasma quasiparticles when the dynamics is
treated classically.
"
What is the concept of Markov chain embedding used for analyzing patterns in random strings?,"  RNA motifs typically consist of short, modular patterns that include base
pairs formed within and between modules. Estimating the abundance of these
patterns is of fundamental importance for assessing the statistical
significance of matches in genomewide searches, and for predicting whether a
given function has evolved many times in different species or arose from a
single common ancestor. In this manuscript, we review in an integrated and
self-contained manner some basic concepts of automata theory, generating
functions and transfer matrix methods that are relevant to pattern analysis in
biological sequences. We formalize, in a general framework, the concept of
Markov chain embedding to analyze patterns in random strings produced by a
memoryless source. This conceptualization, together with the capability of
automata to recognize complicated patterns, allows a systematic analysis of
problems related to the occurrence and frequency of patterns in random strings.
The applications we present focus on the concept of synchronization of
automata, as well as automata used to search for a finite number of keywords
(including sets of patterns generated according to base pairing rules) in a
general text.
"
What is the relationship between antiferromagnetism and superconductivity in an anisotropic 2D Hubbard model?,"  I apply a two-step renormalization group method to the study of the
competition between antiferromagnetism (AFM) and superconductivity in an
anisotropic 2D Hubbard model. I show that this simple model captures the
essentials of the ground-state phases of the quasi 1D organic conductors. As
found experimentally, the ground-state phase diagram is mostly AFM. The AFM is
localized in the strong-coupling limit where the electrons are confined in the
chains. It is an SDW in the weak-coupling limit where interchain hopping is
present. There is a tiny region in the weak-coupling regime where transverse
two-particle hopping is dominant over magnetism.
"
What are the implications of the predictions for the LHC luminosity?,"  We present predictions of the thermal model for hadron ratios in central
Pb+Pb collisions at LHC.
"
What is the folding dynamics of two small helical proteins viewed as an ensemble process?,"  In this study we evaluate, at full atomic detail, the folding processes of
two small helical proteins, the B domain of protein A and the Villin headpiece.
Folding kinetics are studied by performing a large number of ab initio Monte
Carlo folding simulations using a single transferable all-atom potential. Using
these trajectories, we examine the relaxation behavior, secondary structure
formation, and transition-state ensembles (TSEs) of the two proteins and
compare our results with experimental data and previous computational studies.
To obtain a detailed structural information on the folding dynamics viewed as
an ensemble process, we perform a clustering analysis procedure based on graph
theory. Moreover, rigorous pfold analysis is used to obtain representative
samples of the TSEs and a good quantitative agreement between experimental and
simulated Fi-values is obtained for protein A. Fi-values for Villin are also
obtained and left as predictions to be tested by future experiments. Our
analysis shows that two-helix hairpin is a common partially stable structural
motif that gets formed prior to entering the TSE in the studied proteins. These
results together with our earlier study of Engrailed Homeodomain and recent
experimental studies provide a comprehensive, atomic-level picture of folding
mechanics of three-helix bundle proteins.

"What is the relationship between the solution $\phi_{\epsilon,h} $ and $\bar \phi_{\epsilon,h} $ of the operators \Gg[\phi](x) and \bar \Gg[\phi](x)?","  In this paper we present an upper bound for the decay of correlation for the
stationary stochastic process associated with the Entropy Penalized Method. Let
$L(x, v):\Tt^n\times\Rr^n\to \Rr$ be a Lagrangian of the form
  L(x,v) = {1/2}|v|^2 - U(x) + < P, v>.
  For each value of $\epsilon $ and $h$, consider the operator
  \Gg[\phi](x):= -\epsilon h {ln}[\int_{\re^N} e
^{-\frac{hL(x,v)+\phi(x+hv)}{\epsilon h}}dv], as well as the reversed operator
\bar \Gg[\phi](x):= -\epsilon h {ln}[\int_{\re^N}
e^{-\frac{hL(x+hv,-v)+\phi(x+hv)}{\epsilon h}}dv], both acting on continuous
functions $\phi:\Tt^n\to \Rr$. Denote by $\phi_{\epsilon,h} $ the solution of
$\Gg[\phi_{\epsilon,h}]=\phi_{\epsilon,h}+\lambda_{\epsilon,h}$, and by $\bar
\phi_{\epsilon,h} $ the solution of $\bar \Gg[\phi_{\epsilon,h}]=\bar
\phi_{\epsilon,h}+\lambda_{\epsilon,h}$. In order to analyze the decay of
correlation for this process we show that the operator $ {\cal L} (\phi) (x) =
\int e^{- \frac{h L (x,v)}{\epsilon}} \phi(x+h v) d v,$ has a maximal
eigenvalue isolated from the rest of the spectrum.
"
What are the four families of special functions that are studied?,"  Four families of special functions, depending on n variables, are studied. We
call them symmetric and antisymmetric multivariate sine and cosine functions.
They are given as determinants or antideterminants of matrices, whose matrix
elements are sine or cosine functions of one variable each. These functions are
eigenfunctions of the Laplace operator, satisfying specific conditions at the
boundary of a certain domain F of the n-dimensional Euclidean space. Discrete
and continuous orthogonality on F of the functions within each family, allows
one to introduce symmetrized and antisymmetrized multivariate Fourier-like
transforms, involving the symmetric and antisymmetric multivariate sine and
cosine functions.
"
What is the analogy of time diagrams of magnetic pulse influence on single-and two pulse echoes in magnets?,"  By the method of additional pulsed magnetic field influence in different
magnetic materials (half metals, manganites, lithium ferrite, cobalt) it is
established the analogy of time diagrams of magnetic pulse influence on single-
and two pulse echoes in magnets when the distortion mechanism of single-pulse
echo formation is effective, and the absence of such analogy in the case of
lithium ferrite where the multipulse mechanism of single-pulse echo formation
is effective.
  It is shown also that the timing and frequency diagrams of magnetic pulse
influence on the two-pulse echo signals, corresponding to the symmetric and
asymmetric magnetic pulse applications in the studied magnets, are defined by
their domain walls parameters and could serve for their qualitative and
quantitative characterization.
"
What is the relationship between the accretion rate and the characteristic transition radius for a black hole?,"  In the absence of direct kinematic measurements, the mass of an accreting
black hole is sometimes inferred from the X-ray spectral parameters of its
accretion disk; specifically, from the temperature and normalization of a
disk-blackbody model fit. Suitable corrections have to be introduced when the
accretion rate approaches or exceeds the Eddington limit. We summarize
phenomenological models that can explain the very high state, with apparently
higher disk temperatures and lower inner-disk radii. Conversely, ultraluminous
X-ray sources often contain cooler disks with large characteristic radii. We
introduce another phenomenological model for this accretion state. We argue
that a standard disk dominates the radiative output for radii larger than a
characteristic transition radius R_c ~ mdot x R_{ISCO}, where mdot is the
accretion rate in Eddington units and R_{ISCO} is the innermost stable orbit.
For R_{ISCO} < R < R_c, most of the accretion power is released via non-thermal
processes. We predict the location of such sources in a luminosity-temperature
plot. We conclude that black holes with masses ~ 50-100 Msun accreting at mdot
~ 10-20 may explain the X-ray properties of many ULXs.
"
What is the role of radio-frequency pulses in controlling the quantum information transport in a spin chain?,"  Transport of quantum information in linear spin chains has been the subject
of much theoretical work. Experimental studies by nuclear spin systems in
solid-state by NMR (a natural implementation of such models) is complicated
since the dipolar Hamiltonian is not solely comprised of nearest-neighbor
XY-Heisenberg couplings. We present here a similarity transformation between
the XY-Heisenberg Hamiltonian and the grade raising Hamiltonian, an interaction
which is achievable with the collective control provided by radio-frequency
pulses in NMR. Not only does this second Hamiltonian allows us to simulate the
information transport in a spin chain, but it also provides a means to observe
its signature experimentally.
"
What are the Macdonald-Ruijsenaars operators?,"  It is shown that the deformed Macdonald-Ruijsenaars operators can be
described as the restrictions on certain affine subvarieties of the usual
Macdonald-Ruijsenaars operator in infinite number of variables. The ideals of
these varieties are shown to be generated by the Macdonald polynomials related
to Young diagrams with special geometry. The super Macdonald polynomials and
their shifted version are introduced, the combinatorial formulas for them are
given.

"
What are the effects of strong correlations in fermionic gases in optical lattices?,"  This article reviews recent experimental and theoretical progress on
many-body phenomena in dilute, ultracold gases. Its focus are effects beyond
standard weak-coupling descriptions, like the Mott-Hubbard-transition in
optical lattices, strongly interacting gases in one and two dimensions or
lowest Landau level physics in quasi two-dimensional gases in fast rotation.
Strong correlations in fermionic gases are discussed in optical lattices or
near Feshbach resonances in the BCS-BEC crossover.
"
What are the formulas for generating functions for M_2-rank differences for partitions without repeated odd parts?,"  We prove formulas for the generating functions for M_2-rank differences for
partitions without repeated odd parts. These formulas are in terms of modular
forms and generalized Lambert series.
"
What are the complex-analytic properties of the augmented Teichmuller spaces ATS?,"  We study complex-analytic properties of the augmented Teichmuller spaces ATS
introduced by Lipman Bers. These spaces are obtained by adding to the classical
Teichmuller space TS the points corresponding to nodal Riemann surfaces. Unlike
TS, the space ATS is not a complex manifold (it is not even locally compact).
We prove however that the quotient of ATS by any finite index subgroup of the
Teichmuller modular group has a canonical structure of a complex orbifold.
Using this structure we construct natural maps from ATS to stacks of admissible
coverings of stable Riemann surfaces. This result is important for
understanding the cup-product in stringy orbifold cohomology. We also establish
some new technical results from the general theory of orbifolds which may be of
independent interest.
"
How do the decoupled equations relate to the Regge-Wheeler equations?,"  We use the covariant and gauge-invariant 1+1+2 formalism of Clarkson and
Barrett \cite{Clarkson2003} to analyze electromagnetic (EM) perturbations on
non-vacuum {\it locally rotationally symmetric} (LRS) class II space-times.
Ultimately, we show how to derive six real decoupled equations governing the
total of six EM scalar and 2-vector harmonic amplitudes. Four of these are new,
and result from expanding the complex EM 2-vector which we defined in
\cite{Burston2007} in terms of EM 2-vector harmonic amplitudes. We are then
able to show that there are four precise combinations of the amplitudes that
decouple, two of these are polar perturbations whereas the remaining two are
axial. The remaining two decoupled equations are the generalized Regge-Wheeler
equations which were developed previously in \cite{Betschart2004}, and these
govern the two EM scalar harmonic amplitudes. However, our analysis generalizes
this by including a full description and classification of energy-momentum
sources, such as charges and currents.
"
What are the SU(3)-structures on a 6-dimensional manifold M?,"  Hitchin shows that half-flat SU(3)-structures on a 6-dimensional manifold M
can be lifted to parallel G_{2}-structure on the product $M\times\mathbb{R}$.
We show that Hitchin's approach can also be used to construct nearly parallel
G_{2}-structures by lifting so-called nearly half-flat structures. These
SU(3)-structures are described by pairs $(\omega,\phi)$ of stable 2- and
3-forms with $d\phi=\lambda\omega^{2}$ for some
$\lambda\in\mathbb{R}\setminus\{0\}$.
"
What is the relationship between the photon fusion and Drell-Yan processes?,"  We calculate the lowest order cross--section for Dirac magnetic monopole
production from photon fusion in p p-bar collisions at sqrt{s}=1.96 TeV, p p
collisions at sqrt{s}=14 TeV, and we compare photon fusion with Drell--Yan (DY)
production. We find the total photon fusion cross--section is comparable with
DY at sqrt{s}=1.96 TeV and dominates DY by a factor ~50 at sqrt{s}=14 TeV. We
conclude that both the photon fusion and DY processes allow for a monopole mass
limit m>370 GeV based upon the null results of the recent monopole search at
the Collider Detector at Fermilab (CDF). We also conclude that photon fusion is
the leading production mechanism to be considered for direct monopole searches
at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC).
"
What are the role of logarithmic corrections in the analysis of the 4-state Potts model?,"  Monte Carlo and series expansion data for the energy, specific heat,
magnetisation and susceptibility of the 4-state Potts model in the vicinity of
the critical point are analysed. The role of logarithmic corrections is
discussed. Estimates of universal ratios A_+/A_-, $\Gamma_+/\Gamma_L$,
$\Gamma_T/\Gamma_L$ and R_c^+ are given.
"
What are the Clifford algebras used to obtain low ML decoding complexity space-time block codes?,"  ""Extended Clifford algebras"" are introduced as a means to obtain low ML
decoding complexity space-time block codes. Using left regular matrix
representations of two specific classes of extended Clifford algebras, two
systematic algebraic constructions of full diversity Distributed Space-Time
Codes (DSTCs) are provided for any power of two number of relays. The left
regular matrix representation has been shown to naturally result in space-time
codes meeting the additional constraints required for DSTCs. The DSTCs so
constructed have the salient feature of reduced Maximum Likelihood (ML)
decoding complexity. In particular, the ML decoding of these codes can be
performed by applying the lattice decoder algorithm on a lattice of four times
lesser dimension than what is required in general. Moreover these codes have a
uniform distribution of power among the relays and in time, thus leading to a

What are the anisotropic properties of the structural changes for field applied along orthogonal in-plane directions?,"  We report x-ray scattering studies of the c-axis lattice parameter in
Ca3Ru2O7 as a function of temperature and magnetic field. These structural
studies complement published transport and magnetization data, and therefore
elucidate the spin-charge-lattice coupling near the metal-insulator transition.
Strong anisotropy of the structural change for field applied along orthogonal
in-plane directions is observed. Competition between a spin-polarized phase
that does not couple to the lattice, and an antiferromagnetic metallic phase,
which does, gives rise to rich behavior for B $\parallel$ b.

"What is the design of the VERNE machine, a serial/parallel 5-axis machine tool?","  This paper describes the workspace and the inverse and direct kinematic
analysis of the VERNE machine, a serial/parallel 5-axis machine tool designed
by Fatronik for IRCCyN. This machine is composed of a three-degree-of-freedom
(DOF) parallel module and a two-DOF serial tilting table. The parallel module
consists of a moving platform that is connected to a fixed base by three
non-identical legs. This feature involves (i) a simultaneous combination of
rotation and translation for the moving platform, which is balanced by the
tilting table and (ii) workspace whose shape and volume vary as a function of
the tool length. This paper summarizes results obtained in the context of the
European projects NEXT (""Next Generation of Productions Systems"").
"
What are the signatures used to search for a deviation from Standard Model expectations in the ATLAS potential?,"  This paper discusses the ATLAS potential to study Supersymmetry for the
""Focus-Point"" region of the parameter space of mSUGRA models. The potential to
discovery a deviation from Standard Model expectations with the first few
${fb}^{-1}$ of LHC data was studied using the parametrized simulation of the
ATLAS detector. Several signatures were considered, involving hard jets, large
missing energy, and either $b$-tagged jets, opposite-sign isolated electron or
muon pairs, or top quarks reconstructed exploiting their fully hadronic decays.
With only 1 ${fb}^{-1}$ of data each of these signatures may allow to observe
an excess of events over Standard Model expectation with a statistical
significance exceeding 5 standard deviations. An analytical expression was
derived for the shape of the distribution of the dilepton invariant mass
arising from the three-body leptonic decay of the neutralinos under the
hypothesis of heavy scalars, which is appropriate for the focus-point scenario.
The resulting function was used to fit the distribution of the dilepton
invariant mass obtained with simulated LHC data, and to extract the value of
two kinematic endpoints measuring the $\tilde \chi^0_2 - \tilde \chi^0_1$ and
the $\tilde \chi^0_3 - \tilde \chi^0_1$ mass differences. This information was
used to constrain the MSSM parameter space compatible with the data.
"
"What are the properties of the B\""{a}cklund transformation?","  We study an integrable case of n-particle Toda lattice: open chain with
boundary terms containing 4 parameters. For this model we construct a
B\""acklund transformation and prove its basic properties: canonicity,
commutativity and spectrality. The B\""acklund transformation can be also viewed
as a discretized time dynamics. Two Lax matrices are used: of order 2 and of
order 2n+2, which are mutually dual, sharing the same spectral curve.
"
What is the validity range of the crossover description in terms of a single scale factor?,"  We use the mean crossover functions [Garrabos and Bervillier, Phys Rev. E 74,
021113 (2006)] estimated from the bounded results of the Massive
Renormalization scheme applied to the $\Phi_{d}^{4}(n)$ model in three
dimensions ($d=3$) and scalar order parameter ($n=1$) [Bagnuls and Bervillier,
Phys. Rev. E 65, 066132 (2002)], to represent the singular behavior of the
isothermal compressibility of xenon along the critical isochore in the
homogeneous preasymptotic domain. The validity range and the Ising nature of
the crossover description are discussed in terms of a single scale factor whose
value can be analytically estimated beyond the Ising-like preasymptotic domain.
"
What are the characteristics of the grains in the excess emission of a young stellar association?,"  Most Vega-like stars have far-infrared excess (60micron or longward in IRAS,
ISO, or Spitzer MIPS bands) and contain cold dust (<~150K) analogous to the
Sun's Kuiper-Belt region. However, dust in a region more akin to our asteroid
belt and thus relevant to the terrestrial planet building process is warm and
produces excess emission in mid-infrared wavelengths. By cross-correlating
Hipparcos dwarfs with the MSX catalog, we found that EF Cha, a member of the
recently identified, ~10 Myr old, ``Cha-Near'' Moving Group, possesses
prominent mid-infrared excess. N-band spectroscopy reveals a strong emission
feature characterized by a mixture of small, warm, amorphous and possibly
crystalline silicate grains. Survival time of warm dust grains around this A9
star is <~ 1E5 yrs, much less than the age of the star. Thus, grains in this
extra-solar terrestrial planetary zone must be of ""second generation"" and not a
remnant of primodial dust and are suggestive of substantial planet formation
activity. Such second generation warm excess occurs around ~ 13% of the
early-type stars in nearby young stellar associations.
"
What are the effects of nonlinear absorber and external force on the self-organization process?,"  We discuss mechanisms of self-organization processes in two-level solid-state
class-B laser system. The model is considered under assumptions of influence of
nonlinear absorber and external force, separately. It was found that
self-organization occurs through the Hopf bifurcation and results to a stable
pulse radiation. Analysis is performed according to the Floquet exponent
investigation. It was found that influence of the nonlinear absorber extends
the domain of control parameters that manage a stable periodic radiation
processes. An external force suppresses self-organization processes. A combined
influence of both external force and nonlinear absorber results to more
complicated picture of self-organization with two reentrant Hopf bifurcations.
"
"What is the critical exponent of the correlation length for a trapped, weakly interacting Bose gas?","  The phase transition of Bose-Einstein condensation is studied in the critical
regime, when fluctuations extend far beyond the length scale of thermal de
Broglie waves. Using matter-wave interference we measure the correlation length
of these critical fluctuations as a function of temperature. The diverging
behavior of the correlation length above the critical temperature is observed,
from which we determine the critical exponent of the correlation length for a
trapped, weakly interacting Bose gas to be $\nu=0.67\pm 0.13$. This measurement
has direct implications for the understanding of second order phase
transitions.
"
"What is the main difference between the E-pk,obs - E-iso correlation in the Swift sample and the pre-Swift relation?","  We calculate durations and spectral paramaters for 218 Swift bursts detected
by the BAT instrument between and including GRBs 041220 and 070509, including
77 events with measured redshifts. Incorporating prior knowledge into the
spectral fits, we are able to measure the characteristic $\nu F_{\nu}$ spectral
peak energy $E_{\rm pk,obs}$ and the isotropic equivalent energy $E_{\rm iso}$
(1--$10^4$ keV) for all events. This complete and rather extensive catalog,
analyzed with a unified methodology, allows us to address the persistence and
origin of high-energy correlations suggested in pre-Swift observations. We find
that the $E_{\rm pk,obs}$-$E_{\rm iso}$ correlation is present in the Swift
sample; however, the best-fit powerlaw relation is inconsistent with the
best-fit pre-Swift relation at >5 sigma significance. Moreover, it has a factor
>~ 2 larger intrinsic scatter, after accounting for large errors on $E_{\rm
pk,obs}$. A large fraction of the Swift events are hard and subluminous
relative to (and inconsistent with) the pre-Swift relation, in agreement with
indications from BATSE GRBs without redshift. Moreover, we determine an
experimental threshold for the BAT detector and show how the $E_{\rm
pk,obs}$--$E_{\rm iso}$ correlation arises artificially due to partial
correlation with the threshold. We show that pre-Swift correlations found by
Amati et al.(2002), Yonetoku et al. (2004), Firmani et al.(2006) (and
independently by others) are likely unrelated to the physical properties of
GRBs and are likely useless for tests of cosmology. Also, an explanation of
these correlations in terms of a detector threshold provides a natural and
quantitative explanation for why short-duration GRBs and events at low redshift
tend to be outliers to the correlations.

What are the subtle spin boundary conditions in a ferromagnet with finite size?,"  This paper has been withdrawn by the authors in order to comply with the
ATLAS publication policy and is now only available via the CERN cdsweb
(http://cdsweb.cern.ch/record/984015)
"
What is the Markovian form of this strategy?,"  This paper studies a portfolio optimization problem in a discrete-time
Markovian model of a financial market, in which asset price dynamics depend on
an external process of economic factors. There are transaction costs with a
structure that covers, in particular, the case of fixed plus proportional
costs. We prove that there exists a self-financing trading strategy maximizing
the average growth rate of the portfolio wealth. We show that this strategy has
a Markovian form. Our result is obtained by large deviations estimates on
empirical measures of the price process and by a generalization of the
vanishing discount method to discontinuous transition operators.
"
What is the effect of the electric field on the reconfiguration of metallic clusters in manganites?,"  We propose a dielectrophoresis model for phase-separated manganites. Without
increase of the fraction of metallic phase, an insulator-metal transition
occurs when a uniform electric field applied across the system exceeds a
threshold value. Driven by the dielectrophoretic force, the metallic clusters
reconfigure themselves into stripes along the direction of electric field,
leading to the filamentous percolation. This process, which is time-dependent,
irreversible and anisotropic, is a probable origin of the colossal
electroresistance in manganites.
"
How is the effective mass Schrodinger equation solved for a given potential?,"  Effective mass Schrodinger equation is solved exactly for a given potential.
Nikiforov-Uvarov method is used to obtain energy eigenvalues and the
corresponding wave functions. A free parameter is used in the transformation of
the wave function. The effective mass Schrodinger equation is also solved for
the Morse potential transforming to the constant mass Schr\""{o}dinger equation
for a potential. One can also get solution of the effective mass Schrodinger
equation starting from the constant mass Schrodinger equation.
"
What is the relationship between the frequency bandwidth of the amplification mechanism and the rate of thermal relaxation?,"  We study thermal instability in NbN superconducting stripline resonators. The
system exhibits extreme nonlinearity near a bifurcation, which separates a
monostable zone and an astable one. The lifetime of the metastable state, which
is locally stable in the monostable zone, is measure near the bifurcation and
the results are compared with a theory. Near bifurcation, where the lifetime
becomes relatively short, the system exhibits strong amplification of a weak
input modulation signal. We find that the frequency bandwidth of this
amplification mechanism is limited by the rate of thermal relaxation. When the
frequency of the input modulation signal becomes comparable or larger than this
rate the response of the system exhibits sub-harmonics of various orders.
"
What is the dynamic scaling behavior of the kx=0 component of the structure factor?,"  A two-dimensional lattice gas of two species, driven in opposite directions
by an external force, undergoes a jamming transition if the filling fraction is
sufficiently high. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we investigate the growth of
these jams (""clouds""), as the system approaches a non-equilibrium steady state
from a disordered initial state. We monitor the dynamic structure factor
$S(k_x,k_y;t)$ and find that the $k_x=0$ component exhibits dynamic scaling, of
the form $S(0,k_y;t)=t^\beta \tilde{S}(k_yt^\alpha)$. Over a significant range
of times, we observe excellent data collapse with $\alpha=1/2$ and $\beta=1$.
The effects of varying filling fraction and driving force are discussed.
"
What is the design and development of a Microchip PIC16F84 based device that supports RS-232 interface with PC?,"  This article demonstrates how to develop a Microchip PIC16F84 based device
that supports RS-232 interface with PC. Circuit (LED Board) design and software
development will be discussed. PicBasic Pro Compiler from microEngineering
Labs, Inc. is used for PIC programming. Development of LED Board Control
Console using C/C++ is also briefly discussed. The project requires basic work
experience with Microchip PICs, serial communication and programming.
"
What is the impact of the floating-point precision and interpolation scheme on the results of DNS of turbulence?,"  In this paper we investigate the impact of the floating-point precision and
interpolation scheme on the results of direct numerical simulations (DNS) of
turbulence by pseudo-spectral codes. Three different types of floating-point
precision configurations show no differences in the statistical results. This
implies that single precision computations allow for increased Reynolds numbers
due to the reduced amount of memory needed. The interpolation scheme for
obtaining velocity values at particle positions has a noticeable impact on the
Lagrangian acceleration statistics. A tri-cubic scheme results in a slightly
broader acceleration probability density function than a tri-linear scheme.
Furthermore the scaling behavior obtained by the cubic interpolation scheme
exhibits a tendency towards a slightly increased degree of intermittency
compared to the linear one.
"
How is the method of immunization effective in various social networks and scale-free networks?,"  We introduce an immunization method where the percentage of required
vaccinations for immunity are close to the optimal value of a targeted
immunization scheme of highest degree nodes. Our strategy retains the advantage
of being purely local, without the need of knowledge on the global network
structure or identification of the highest degree nodes. The method consists of
selecting a random node and asking for a neighbor that has more links than
himself or more than a given threshold and immunizing him. We compare this
method to other efficient strategies on three real social networks and on a
scale-free network model, and find it to be significantly more effective.
"
What are the hardness results for the problem of computing the value of one-round games played by a verifier and a team of provers who can share quantum entanglement?,"  We establish the first hardness results for the problem of computing the
value of one-round games played by a verifier and a team of provers who can
share quantum entanglement. In particular, we show that it is NP-hard to
approximate within an inverse polynomial the value of a one-round game with (i)
quantum verifier and two entangled provers or (ii) classical verifier and three
entangled provers. Previously it was not even known if computing the value
exactly is NP-hard. We also describe a mathematical conjecture, which, if true,
would imply hardness of approximation to within a constant.
  We start our proof by describing two ways to modify classical multi-prover
games to make them resistant to entangled provers. We then show that a strategy
for the modified game that uses entanglement can be ``rounded'' to one that
does not. The results then follow from classical inapproximability bounds. Our
work implies that, unless P=NP, the values of entangled-prover games cannot be
computed by semidefinite programs that are polynomial in the size of the
verifier's system, a method that has been successful for more restricted
quantum games.
"
What are the applications of the Markovian master equation to the case of a Brownian point particle and the case of a complex molecule in a gaseous environment?,"  A general method is discussed to obtain Markovian master equations which
describe the interaction with the environment in a microscopic and
non-perturbative fashion. It is based on combining time-dependent scattering
theory with the concept of continuous quantum measurements. The applications to
the case of a Brownian point particle and to the case of a complex molecule,
both in the presence of a gaseous environment, are outlined.
"
What is the relationship between the finite element model and the real experiments?,"  In a recent work, B\""ol and Reese have introduced a discrete model for
polymer networks by means of a finite element modeling. They have also provided
a comparison with real experiments. A key parameter of their model is the size
h of the finite element mesh, that is meant to be small in practice. The aim of
the present work is to study the asymptotic behaviour (and the convergence of
the finite element method) when the meshsize goes to zero. In particular, we
address the properties satisfied by the model at the limit, depending on the
properties of the mesh.
"
What are the results of searches for large extra dimensions?,"  This poster, presented at the 2006 Duke Hadron Collider Symposium, presents
the results from searches for large extra dimensions, as proposed by
Arkani-Hamed, Dimopoulos and Dvali (ADD), and Randall-Sundrum (RS) model warped
extra dimensions, at CDF.
"
"What are the results of the analysis of the ZZZ, ZZgam, and Zgam couplings with the DELPHI detector?","  Neutral triple-gauge-boson couplings ZZZ, ZZgam and Zgamgam have been studied
with the DELPHI detector using data at energies between 183 and 208 GeV. Limits
are derived on these couplings from an analysis of the reactions e+e- -> Zgam,
using data from the final states gamma f fbar, with f = q or neutrino, from
e+e- -> ZZ, using data from the four-fermion final states q qbar q qbar, q qbar
mu+ mu-, q qbar e+ e-, q qbar nu nubar, mu+ mu- nu nubar and e+ e- nu nubar,
and from e+e- -> Zgam*, in which the final state gamma is off mass-shell, using
data from the four-fermion final states q qbar e+ e- and q qbar mu+ mu-. No
evidence for the presence of such couplings is observed, in agreement with the
predictions of the Standard Model.
"
"What is the encoding of ungauged Lagrangians in the E_7(7)\Sp(56,R)/GL(28) matrix?","  All maximal supergravities in four space-time dimensions are presented. The
ungauged Lagrangians can be encoded in an E_7(7)\Sp(56,R)/GL(28) matrix
associated with the freedom of performing electric/magnetic duality
transformations. The gauging is defined in terms of an embedding tensor which
encodes the subgroup of E_7(7) that is realized as a local invariance. This
embedding tensor may imply the presence of magnetic charges which require
corresponding dual gauge fields. The latter can be incorporated by using a
recently proposed formulation that involves tensor gauge fields in the adjoint
representation of E_7(7). In this formulation the results take a universal form
irrespective of the electric/magnetic duality basis. We present the general
class of supersymmetric and gauge invariant Lagrangians and discuss a number of
applications.
"
What are the main differences between the droplet energy in +-J models with open boundary conditions and those with fixed boundary conditions?,"  Using mappings to computer-science problems and by applying sophisticated
algorithms, one can study numerically many problems much better compared to
applying standard approaches like Monte Carlo simulations. Here, using
calculations of ground states of suitable perturbed systems, droplets are
obtained in two-dimensional +-J spin glasses, which are in the focus of a
currently very lifely debate. Since a sophisticated matching algorithm is
applied here, exact ground states of large systems up to L^2=256^2 spins can be
generated. Furthermore, no equilibration or extrapolation to T=0 is necessary.
Three different +-J models are studied here: a) with open boundary conditions,
b) with fixed boundary conditions and c) a diluted system where a fraction
p=0.125 of all bonds is zero. For large systems, the droplet energy shows for
all three models a power-law behavior E_D L^\theta'_D with \theta'_D<0. This is
different from previous studies of domain walls, where a convergence to a
constant non-zero value (\theta_dw=0) has been found for such models. After
correcting for the non-compactness of the droplets, the results are likely to
be compatible with \theta_D= -0.29 for all three models.
  This is in accordance with the Gaussian system where \theta_D=-0.287(4)
(\nu=3.5 via \nu=-1/\theta_D). Nevertheless, the disorder-averaged spin-spin
correlation exponent \eta is determined here via the probability to have a
non-zero-energy droplet, and \eta~0.22$ is found for all three models, this
being in contrast to the behavior of the model with Gaussian interactions,
where exactly \eta=0.
"
What are the expectations for the branching ratios of rare K decays in Minimal Flavour Violation (MFV) models?,"  The rare kaon decays K_L -> pi^0 nu {bar nu}, K^+ -> pi^+ nu {bar nu}, K_L ->
pi^0 e^+ e^- and K_L -> pi^0 mu^+ mu^- are theoretically very clean and, being
strongly CKM suppressed, highly sensitive to New Physics (NP). Recent Flavour
Physics analyses show that they represent unique probes for revealing NP
effects and to provide information on the NP flavour structure. After a brief
discussion of the main properties that make rare K decays so promising and of
the basic ideas of the most interesting NP models, we review the results of
recent phenomenological analyses both within and beyond the framework of
Minimal Flavour Violation (MFV), where the sources of flavour violation are the
same as in the Standard Model. Within MFV we present the expectations found for
rare K decays from a model-independent analysis and in three MFV models: the
Littlest Higgs (LH) model, the (extra-dimension) Appelquist-Cheng-Dobrescu
model and the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) with MFV. Beyond
MFV, we discuss the results recently found within the MSSM (without MFV), the
LH model with T-parity (LHT) and the 3-3-1 (Z') model. While in MFV models only
small (<30%) NP effects are allowed in the branching ratios of K_L -> pi^0 nu
{bar nu}, K^+ -> pi^+ nu {bar nu}, K_L -> pi^0 e^+ e^- and K_L -> pi^0 mu^+
mu^-, beyond MFV, in particular in the MSSM and in the LHT model, large (up to
an order of magnitude) enhancements w.r.t. the SM turn out to be possible.
"
What are the metadislocations of lowest energy in quasicrystals related to experimentally observed ones?,"  The approximants xi, xi' and xi'_n of the quasicrystal Al-Mn-Pd display most
interesting plastic properties as for example phason-induced deformation
processes (Klein, H., Audier, M., Boudard, M., de Boissieu, M., Beraha, L., and
Duneau, M., 1996, Phil. Mag. A, 73, 309.) or metadislocations (Klein, H.,
Feuerbacher, M., Schall, P., and Urban, K., 1999, Phys. Rev. Lett., 82, 3468.).
Here we demonstrate that the phases and their deformed or defected states can
be described by a simple projection formalism in three-dimensional space - not
as usual in four to six dimensions. With the method we can interpret
microstructures observed with electron microscopy as phasonic phase boundaries.
Furthermore we determine the metadislocations of lowest energy and relate them
uniquely to experimentally observed ones. Since moving metadislocations in the
xi'-phase can create new phason-planes, we suggest a dislocation induced phase
transition from xi' to xi'_n. The methods developed in this paper can as well
be used for various other complex metallic alloys.
"
What is the magnetic susceptibility of the kagome lattice model with high-temperature expansions?,"  We compute the magnetic susceptibility and specific heat of the spin-1/2
Heisenberg model on the kagome lattice with high-temperature expansions and
exact diagonalizations. We compare the results with the experimental data on
ZnCu3(OH)6Cl2 obtained by Helton et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 98, 107204 (2007)].
Down to k_BT/J~0.2, our calculations reproduce accurately the experimental
susceptibility, with an exchange interaction J~190K and a contribution of 3.7%
of weakly interacting impurity spins. The comparison between our calculations
of the specific heat and the experiments indicate that the low-temperature
entropy (below ~20K) is smaller in ZnCu3(OH)6Cl2 than in the kagome Heisenberg
model, a likely signature of other interactions in the system.
"
How are tomographic probability distributions used in minisuperspace models?,"  The probability representation, in which cosmological quantum states are
described by a standard positive probability distribution, is constructed for
minisuperspace models selected by Noether symmetries. In such a case, the
tomographic probability distribution provides the classical evolution for the
models and can be considered an approach to select ""observable"" universes. Some
specific examples, derived from Extended Theories of Gravity, are worked out.
We discuss also how to connect tomograms, symmetries and cosmological
parameters.
"
What are the observed effects of magnetic fields on the mechanism of gamma-ray emission in stellar collapse or collision?,"  A study of gamma rays produced when stars collapse or collide reveals details
of the explosion mechanism, particularly the role of magnetic fields.
"
How does the spin of a massive black hole impact the detection range for intermediate-mass-ratio inspiral (IMRI) and extreme-mass-ratio inspiral (EMRI) detections?,"  We compute the probability distribution for the spin of a black hole
following a series of minor mergers with isotropically distributed,
non-spinning, inspiraling compact objects. By solving the Fokker-Planck
equation governing this stochastic process, we obtain accurate analytical fits
for the evolution of the mean and standard deviation of the spin distribution
in several parameter regimes. We complement these analytical fits with
numerical Monte-Carlo simulations in situations when the Fokker-Planck analysis
is not applicable. We find that a ~150 solar-mass intermediate-mass black hole
that gained half of its mass through minor mergers with neutron stars will have
dimensionless spin parameter chi=a/M~0.2 \pm 0.08. We estimate the effect of
the spin of the central black hole on the detection range for
intermediate-mass-ratio inspiral (IMRI) detections by Advanced LIGO and
extreme-mass-ratio inspiral(EMRI) detections by LISA. We find that for
realistic black hole spins, the inclination-averaged Advanced-LIGO IMRI
detection range may be increased by up to 10% relative to the range for IMRIs
into non-spinning intermediate-mass black holes. For LISA, we find that the
detection range for EMRIs into 10^5 solar-mass massive black holes (MBHs) is
not significantly affected by MBH spin, the range for EMRIs into 10^6
solar-mass MBHs is affected at the ~ 10% level, and EMRIs into maximally
spinning 10^7 solar-mass MBHs are detectable to a distance ~25 times greater
than EMRIs into non-spinning black holes. The resulting bias in favor of
detecting EMRIs into rapidly spinning MBHs will play a role when extracting the
MBH spin distribution from EMRI statistics.
"
What are the effects of electron interaction on the conductance oscillations in open quantum dots?,"  We perform self-consistent quantum transport calculations in open quantum
dots taking into account the effect of electron interaction. We demonstrative
that in the regime of the ultralow temperatures $2\pi k_BT\lesssim\Delta$
($\Delta $ being the mean level spacing), the electron interaction strongly
affects the conductance oscillations and their statistics leading to a drastic
deviation from the corresponding predictions for noninteracting electrons. In
particular, it causes smearing of conductance oscillations, which is similar to
the effect of temperature or inelastic scattering. For $2\pi k_BT\gtrsim\Delta$
the influence of electron interaction on the conductance becomes strongly
diminished. Our calculations (that are free from phenomenological parameters of
the theory) are in good quantitative agreement with the observed ultralow
temperature statistics (Huibers \textit{et al.}, Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{81},
1917 (1998)). Our findings question a conventional interpretation of the
ultralow temperature saturation of the coherence time in open dots which is
based on the noninteracting theories where the electron interaction is
neglected and the agrement with the experiment is achieved by introducing
additional phenomenological channels of dephasing.
"
What are the possible options to resolve the paradox of black hole information localization?,"  Semiclassical reasoning suggests that the process by which an object
collapses into a black hole and then evaporates by emitting Hawking radiation
may destroy information, a problem often referred to as the black hole
information paradox. Further, there seems to be no unique prediction of where
the information about the collapsing body is localized. We propose that the
latter aspect of the paradox may be a manifestation of an inconsistent
self-reference in the semiclassical theory of black hole evolution. This
suggests the inadequacy of the semiclassical approach or, at worst, that
standard quantum mechanics and general relavity are fundamentally incompatible.
One option for the resolution for the paradox in the localization is to
identify the G\""odel-like incompleteness that corresponds to an imposition of
consistency, and introduce possibly new physics that supplies this
incompleteness. Another option is to modify the theory in such a way as to
prohibit self-reference. We discuss various possible scenarios to implement
these options, including eternally collapsing objects, black hole remnants,
black hole final states, and simple variants of semiclassical quantum gravity.
"
What is the relation between the stability and throughput regions of a network with N sources and M destinations?,"  A wireless network in which packets are broadcast to a group of receivers
through use of a random access protocol is considered in this work. The
relation to previous work on networks of interacting queues is discussed and
subsequently, the stability and throughput regions of the system are analyzed
and presented. A simple network of two source nodes and two destination nodes
is considered first. The broadcast service process is analyzed assuming a
channel that allows for packet capture and multipacket reception. In this small
network, the stability and throughput regions are observed to coincide. The
same problem for a network with N sources and M destinations is considered
next. The channel model is simplified in that multipacket reception is no
longer permitted. Bounds on the stability region are developed using the
concept of stability rank and the throughput region of the system is compared
to the bounds. Our results show that as the number of destination nodes
increases, the stability and throughput regions diminish. Additionally, a
previous conjecture that the stability and throughput regions coincide for a
network of arbitrarily many sources is supported for a broadcast scenario by
the results presented in this work.
"
What are the implications of exponential dependence on translocation time?,"  We investigate the influence of polymer-pore interactions on the
translocation dynamics using Langevin dynamics simulations. An attractive
interaction can greatly improve translocation probability. At the same time, it
also increases translocation time slowly for weak attraction while exponential
dependence is observed for strong attraction. For fixed driving force and chain
length the histogram of translocation time has a transition from Gaussian
distribution to long-tailed distribution with increasing attraction. Under a
weak driving force and a strong attractive force, both the translocation time
and the residence time in the pore show a non-monotonic behavior as a function
of the chain length. Our simulations results are in good agreement with recent
experimental data.
"
What is the relation between integrated intensity and column density of HCN and HCO+ lines as high density tracers in nearby galaxies?,"  We explore millimeter line diagnostics of an obscuring molecular torus
modeled by a hydrodynamic simulation with three-dimensional nonLTE radiative
transfer calculations. Based on the results of high-resolution hydrodynamic
simulation of the molecular torus around an AGN, we calculate intensities of
HCN and HCO^{+} rotational lines as two representative high density tracers.
The three-dimensional radiative transfer calculations shed light on a
complicated excitation state in the inhomogeneous torus, even though a
spatially uniform chemical structure is assumed. Our results suggest that HCN
must be much more abundant than HCO^{+} in order to obtain a high ratio
($R_{HCN/HCO+}\sim 2$) observed in some of the nearby galaxies. There is a
remarkable dispersion in the relation between integrated intensity and column
density, indicative of possible shortcomings of HCN(1-0) and HCO^{+}(1-0) lines
as high density tracers. The internal structures of the inhomogeneous molecular
torus down to subparsec scale in external galaxies will be revealed by the
forthcoming Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). The
three-dimensional radiative transfer calculations of molecular lines with
high-resolution hydrodynamic simulation prove to be a powerful tool to provide
a physical basis for molecular line diagnostics of the central regions of
external galaxies.
"
What are the key concepts in the problem of General Relativity?,"  We provide $L^1$ estimates for a class of transport equations containing
singular integral operators. While our main application is for a specific
problem in General Relativity we believe that the phenomenon which our result
illustrates is of a more general interest.

What is the Markov chain model used to track the evolution of a single base position along single strands of genomes?,"  Chargaff's second parity rule holds empirically for most types of DNA that
along single strands of DNA the base contents are equal for complimentary
bases, A = T, G = C. A Markov chain model is constructed to track the evolution
of any single base position along single strands of genomes whose organisms are
equipped with replication mismatch repair. Under the key assumptions that
mismatch error rates primarily depend the number of hydrogen bonds of
nucleotides and that the mismatch repairing process itself makes strand
recognition error, the model shows that the steady state probabilities for any
base position to take on one of the 4 nucleotide bases are equal for
complimentary bases. As a result, Chargaff's second parity rule is the
manifestation of the Law of Large Number acting on the steady state
probabilities. More importantly, because the model pinpoints mismatch repair as
a basis of the rule, it is suitable for experimental verification.
"
What is the relationship between the entropy of the quantized spin modes and the spin boundary condition in a ferromagnet with finite size?,"  This note contains a correction of the proofs of the main results of the
paper [A. Yekutieli, Deformation quantization in algebraic geometry, Adv. Math.
198 (2005), 383-432]. The results are correct as originally stated.
"
What are the effects of stretching the DNA double helix on its electronic properties and electronic transport?,"  When the DNA double helix is subjected to external forces it can stretch
elastically to elongations reaching 100% of its natural length. These
distortions, imposed at the mesoscopic or macroscopic scales, have a dramatic
effect on electronic properties at the atomic scale and on electrical transport
along DNA. Accordingly, a multiscale approach is necessary to capture the
electronic behavior of the stretched DNA helix. To construct such a model, we
begin with accurate density-functional-theory calculations for electronic
states in DNA bases and base pairs in various relative configurations
encountered in the equilibrium and stretched forms. These results are
complemented by semi-empirical quantum mechanical calculations for the states
of a small size [18 base pair poly(CG)-poly(CG)] dry, neutral DNA sequence,
using previously published models for stretched DNA. The calculated electronic
states are then used to parametrize an effective tight-binding model that can
describe electron hopping in the presence of environmental effects, such as the
presence of stray water molecules on the backbone or structural features of the
substrate. These effects introduce disorder in the model hamiltonian which
leads to electron localization. The localization length is smaller by several
orders of magnitude in stretched DNA relative to that in the unstretched
structure.
"
What is the relationship between the corrected cross sections and their nonlinearities?,"  We use the world's data on elastic electron--proton scattering and
calculations of two-photon exchange effects to extract corrected values of the
proton's electric and magnetic form factors over the full Q^2 range of the
existing data. Our analysis combines the corrected Rosenbluth cross section and
polarization transfer data, and is the first extraction of G_Ep and G_Mp
including explicit two-photon exchange corrections and their associated
uncertainties. In addition, we examine the angular dependence of the corrected
cross sections, and discuss the possible nonlinearities of the cross section as
a function of epsilon.
"
What are the implications of the trading algorithm in financial markets?,"  Anchoring is a term used in psychology to describe the common human tendency
to rely too heavily (anchor) on one piece of information when making decisions.
A trading algorithm inspired by biological motors, introduced by L.
Gil\cite{Gil}, is suggested as a testing ground for anchoring in financial
markets. An exact solution of the algorithm is presented for arbitrary price
distributions. Furthermore the algorithm is extended to cover the case of a
market neutral portfolio, revealing additional evidence that anchoring is
involved in the decision making of market participants. The exposure of
arbitrage possibilities created by anchoring gives yet another illustration on
the difficulty proving market efficiency by only considering lower order
correlations in past price time series
"
How are the MSSM interactions described in terms of two operators?,"  We interpret the current experimental limit on the lightest Higgs boson mass
to suggest that if nature is supersymmetric, there are additional interactions
beyond those of the MSSM coming from new degrees of freedom around the TeV
scale. Within an effective field theory analysis, the leading order corrections
to the MSSM are described in terms of only two operators. This provides a
highly constrained description of Beyond MSSM (BMSSM) physics. The scalar Higgs
spectrum as well as the chargino and neutralino spectrum and couplings are
modified in a distinctive way. These operators can be generated by a variety of
microscopic mechanisms.
"
What are the practical circumstances under which the Metropolis Algorithm is used?,"  An easy-to-implement form of the Metropolis Algorithm is described which,
unlike most standard techniques, is well suited to sampling from multi-modal
distributions on spaces with moderate numbers of dimensions (order ten) in
environments typical of investigations into current constraints on
Beyond-the-Standard-Model physics. The sampling technique makes use of
pre-existing information (which can safely be of low or uncertain quality)
relating to the distribution from which it is desired to sample. This
information should come in the form of a ``bank'' or ``cache'' of space points
of which at least some may be expected to be near regions of interest in the
desired distribution. In practical circumstances such ``banks of clues'' are
easy to assemble from earlier work, aborted runs, discarded burn-in samples
from failed sampling attempts, or from prior scouting investigations. The
technique equilibrates between disconnected parts of the distribution without
user input. The algorithm is not lead astray by ``bad'' clues, but there is no
free lunch: performance gains will only be seen where clues are helpful.
"
What is the Bayesian probability theory used to analyze the oft-made assumption that humans are typical observers in the universe?,"  Bayesian probability theory is used to analyze the oft-made assumption that
humans are typical observers in the universe. Some theoretical calculations
make the {\it selection fallacy} that we are randomly chosen from a class of
objects by some physical process, despite the absence of any evidence for such
a process, or any observational evidence favoring our typicality. It is
possible to favor theories in which we are typical by appropriately choosing
their prior probabilities, but such assumptions should be made explicit to
avoid confusion.
"
What is the relationship between the number of rational points of X and the constant in the estimate?,"  Let X be a geometrically integral projective cubic hypersurface defined over
the rationals, with dimension D and singular locus of dimension at most D-4.
For any \epsilon>0, we show that X contains O(B^{D+\epsilon}) rational points
of height at most B. The implied constant in this estimate depends upon the
choice of \epsilon and the coefficients of the cubic form defining X.
"
What are the differences in the flexibility of a protein under different solvent environments?,"  The dynamics of a folded protein is studied in water and glycerol at a series
of temperatures below and above their respective dynamical transition. The
system is modeled in two distinct states whereby the protein is decoupled from
the bulk solvent at low temperatures, and communicates with it through a
vicinal layer at physiological temperatures. A linear viscoelastic model
elucidates the less-than-expected increase in the relaxation times observed in
the backbone dynamics of the protein. The model further explains the increase
in the flexibility of the protein once the transition takes place and the
differences in the flexibility under the different solvent environments.
Coupling between the vicinal layer and the protein fluctuations is necessary to
interpret these observations. The vicinal layer is postulated to form once a
threshold for the volumetric fluctuations in the protein to accommodate
solvents of different sizes is reached. Compensation of entropic-energetic
contributions from the protein-coupled vicinal layer quantifies the scaling of
the dynamical transition temperatures in various solvents. The protein adapts
different conformational routes for organizing the required coupling to a
specific solvent, which is achieved by adjusting the amount of conformational
jumps in the surface-group dihedrals.
"
What is the relationship between the electron-electron Coulomb interaction and the conductance oscillations in the quantum Hall regime?,"  We report experiments on Fabry-Perot electron interferometers in the integer
quantum Hall regime. The GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructure devices consist of two
constrictions defined by etch trenches in 2D electron layer, enclosing an
approximately circular island. The interferometer is formed by
counterpropagating chiral edge channels coupled by tunneling in the two
constrictions. Interference fringes are observed as conductance oscillations,
similar to the Aharonov-Bohm effect. Front gates deposited in etch trenches
allow to fine-tune the device and to change the constriction filling f relative
to the bulk filling. Quantum-coherent conductance oscillations are observed on
the f = 1 - 4 plateaus. On plateau f we observe f conductance oscillations per
fundamental flux period h/e. This is attributed to the dominance of the
electron-electron Coulomb interaction, effectively mixing Landau level
occupation. On the other hand, the back-gate charge period is the same (one
electron) on all plateaus, independent of filling. This is attributed to the
self-consistent electrostatics in the large electron island. We also report
dependence of the oscillation period on front-gate voltage for f = 1, 2 and 4
for three devices. We find a linear dependence, with the slope inversely
proportional to f for f = 1 and 2.
"
What are the regularity and topology conditions imposed on the exact Type IIB solutions?,"  Regularity and topology conditions are imposed on the exact Type IIB
solutions on $AdS_4 \times S^2 \times S^2 \times \Sigma $ with 16
supersymmetries, which were derived in a companion paper. We construct an
infinite class of regular solutions with varying dilaton, and non-zero 3-form
fluxes. Our solutions may be viewed as the fully back-reacted geometries of
$AdS_5 \times S^5$ (or more generally, Janus) doped with D5 and/or NS5 branes.
The solutions are parametrized by the choice of an arbitrary genus $g$
hyper-elliptic Riemann surface $\Sigma $ with boundary, all of whose branch
points are restricted to lie on a line. For genus 0, the Janus solution with 16
supersymmetries and 6 real parameters is recovered; its topology coincides with
that of $AdS_5 \times S^5$. The genus $g\geq 1$ solutions are parametrized by a
total of $4g+6$ real numbers, $2g-1$ of which are the real moduli of $\Sigma$.
The solutions have $2g+2$ asymptotic $AdS_5 \times S^5$ regions, $g$
three-spheres with RR 3-form charge, and another $g$ with NSNS 3-form charge.
Collapse of consecutive branch points of $\Sigma $ yields singularities which
correspond to D5 and NS5 branes in the probe limit. It is argued that the
AdS/CFT dual gauge theory to each of our solutions consists of a
2+1-dimensional planar interface on which terminate $2g+2$ half-Minkowski
3+1-dimensional space-time $\mathcal{N}=4$ super-Yang-Mills theories.
Generally, the $\\mathcal{N}=4$ theory in each Minkowski half-space-time may
have an independent value of the gauge coupling, and the interface may support
various operators, whose interface couplings are further free parameters of the
dual gauge theory.
"
What are the common characteristics of the sources in the XBS survey that show no evidence of an AGN in their optical spectra?,"  AIMS: We investigate here the nature of all the sources (35 in total) in the
XBS survey (which is 86% optically identified) showing an optical spectrum
dominated by the light from the host galaxy with no evidence (or little
evidence) for the presence of an AGN. METHODS: We use the X-ray spectral
analysis to assess the presence of an AGN in these sources and to characterize
its properties. RESULTS: We detect AGN activity in 33 out of 35 sources. The
remaining 2 sources are the ones with the lowest X-ray luminosity in the sample
(L[2-10keV]<10^41 erg s^-1) and their X-ray emission could be produced within
the host galaxy. We find that the ``recognition problem'' for AGN is very
critical in the low-luminosity regime (at least 60% of the AGN with
L[2-10keV]<10^43 erg s^-1 are elusive) becoming negligible for high X-ray
luminosities (~1.5% of elusive AGN with L[2-10keV]>10^44 erg s^-1). This
problem affects mostly absorbed AGN (~40% of type~2 AGN in the survey are
elusive) but also a significant fraction of unabsorbed AGN (8%). CONCLUSIONS:
We find that the simplest explanations of why these 33 (or most of them) AGNs
are elusive are two: at low X-ray luminosities (<10^43 erg s^-1) the most
important reason is the intrinsically low AGN/galaxy contrast (optical
dilution) while at high luminosities (>10^44 erg s^-1) it is due to the optical
absorption (in the Compton-thin regime, i.e. NH<10^24 cm^-2). Alternative
hypotheses, like the presence of Compton-thick sources, BL Lac objects or
``non-standard'' AGN (e.g. with alpha_OX<1 or with weak/absorbed Narrow Line
Region) are not supported by the data although we cannot exclude the presence
in the sample of a few sources of these types.
"
What are the definite integrals in the classical table of Gradshteyn and Ryzhik that can be reduced to the gamma,"  We present a systematic derivation of some definite integrals in the
classical table of Gradshteyn and Ryzhik that can be reduced to the gamma
function.
"
What are the error terms in the expansion of the wave equation in the De Sitter-Schwarzschild metric?,"  We describe an expansion of the solution of the wave equation in the De
Sitter - Schwarzschild metric in terms of resonances. The main term in the
expansion is due to a zero resonance. The error term decays polynomially if we
permit a logarithmic derivative loss in the angular directions and
exponentially if we permit an small derivative loss in the angular directions.
"
What are the limitations of the assumption of loop equilibrium in the analysis of the decay phase?,"  The diagnostics of stellar flaring coronal loops have been so far largely
based on the analysis of the decay phase. We derive new diagnostics from the
analysis of the rise and peak phase of stellar flares. We release the
assumption of full equilibrium of the flaring loop at the flare peak, according
to the frequently observed delay between the temperature and the density
maximum. From scaling laws and hydrodynamic simulations we derive diagnostic
formulas as a function of observable quantities and times. We obtain a
diagnostic toolset related to the rise phase, including the loop length,
density and aspect ratio. We discuss the limitations of this approach and find
that the assumption of loop equilibrium in the analysis of the decay leads to a
moderate overestimate of the loop length. A few relevant applications to
previously analyzed stellar flares are shown. The analysis of the flare rise
and peak phase complements and completes the analysis of the decay phase.
"
What is the Gauss-Bonnet parameter used in the construction of an anti-deSitter spacetime?,"  We shall first discuss motivation for higher dimension even for classical
description of gravitational dynamics and then construct a black hole out of an
anti-deSitter (AdS) spacetime by prescribing a coupling between Gauss-Bonnet
parameter, constant curvature of extra dimensional space and $\Lambda$. This is
a creation of pure curvature which establishes the fundamental reciprocity
between matter and gravity/curvature.
"
What are the restrictions on the allowed ranges for the mixing phases?,"  Rephasing invariants of quark and lepton mixing matrices are obtained in the
standard model extended by the seesaw mechanism, and in its low-energy
effective theory with the dimension-five Majorana mass operator. We classify
the basic invariants, discuss non-trivial relations between them, and determine
the independent invariants which characterize all the information in the mixing
matrices in a basis-independent way. We also discuss the restrictions on the
allowed ranges for the mixing phases, and on the rephasing invariants, which
follow from a discrete invariance of the Majorana mass matrix.
"
What is the aim of the theory of Breuil?,"  This note is a correction of (statement and proof of) proposition 3.3.1 of
Toby Gee's preprint intitled *On the weights of mod p Hilbert modular forms*.
The aim is to compare Galois representations arising from extensions of some
group schemes (over the ring of integers of a p-adic field) endowed with a
descent data, and extensions of some crystalline representations with given
Hodge-Tate weights. The main tool of the proof is the theory of Breuil.
"
What is the effect of distant positive and negative interactions on the correlation exponent of autoregressive processes?,"  Autoregressive processes (AR) have typical short-range memory. Detrended
Fluctuation Analysis (DFA) was basically designed to reveal long range
correlation in non stationary processes. However DFA can also be regarded as a
suitable method to investigate both long-range and short range correlation in
non-stationary and stationary systems. Applying DFA to AR processes can help
understanding the non uniform correlation structure of such processes. We
systematically investigated a first order autoregressive model AR(1) by DFA and
established the relationship between the interaction constant of AR(1) and the
DFA correlation exponent. The higher the interaction constant the higher is the
short range correlation exponent. They are exponentially related. The
investigation was extended to AR(2) processes. The presence of a distant
positive interaction in addition to a near by interaction will increase the
correlation exponent and the range of correlation while the effect of a distant
negative interaction will decrease significantly only the range of interaction.
This analysis demonstrate the possibility to identify and AR(1) model in an
unknown DFA plot or to distinguish among AR(1) and AR(2) models. The analysis
was performed on medium long series of 1000 terms.
"
What is the visibility of interferences in an electronic Mach-Zehnder interferometer measured using a statistical method?,"  We present an original statistical method to measure the visibility of
interferences in an electronic Mach-Zehnder interferometer in the presence of
low frequency fluctuations. The visibility presents a single side lobe
structure shown to result from a gaussian phase averaging whose variance is
quadratic with the bias. To reinforce our approach and validate our statistical
method, the same experiment is also realized with a stable sample. It exhibits
the same visibility behavior as the fluctuating one, indicating the intrinsic
character of finite bias phase averaging. In both samples, the dilution of the
impinging current reduces the variance of the gaussian distribution.
"
What are the differences between Markovian and non-Markovian decoherence in the context of continuous error correction?,"  We study the effect of continuous quantum error correction in the case where
each qubit in a codeword is subject to a general Hamiltonian interaction with
an independent bath. We first consider the scheme in the case of a trivial
single-qubit code, which provides useful insights into the workings of
continuous error correction and the difference between Markovian and
non-Markovian decoherence. We then study the model of a bit-flip code with each
qubit coupled to an independent bath qubit and subject to continuous
correction, and find its solution. We show that for sufficiently large
error-correction rates, the encoded state approximately follows an evolution of
the type of a single decohering qubit, but with an effectively decreased
coupling constant. The factor by which the coupling constant is decreased
scales quadratically with the error-correction rate. This is compared to the
case of Markovian noise, where the decoherence rate is effectively decreased by
a factor which scales only linearly with the rate of error correction. The
quadratic enhancement depends on the existence of a Zeno regime in the
Hamiltonian evolution which is absent in purely Markovian dynamics. We analyze
the range of validity of this result and identify two relevant time scales.
Finally, we extend the result to more general codes and argue that the
performance of continuous error correction will exhibit the same qualitative
characteristics.
"
What is the hole structure that emerges from a system of nonlocally coupled noisy phase oscillators?,"  We demonstrate that a system of nonlocally coupled noisy phase oscillators
can collectively exhibit a hole structure, which manifests itself in the
spatial phase distribution of the oscillators. The phase model is described by
a nonlinear Fokker-Planck equation, which can be reduced to the complex
Ginzburg-Landau equation near the Hopf bifurcation point of the uniform
solution. By numerical simulations, we show that the hole structure clearly
appears in the space-dependent order parameter, which corresponds to the
Nozaki-Bekki hole solution of the complex Ginzburg-Landau equation.
"
What are the new nonimmersions of real projective spaces in the spectrum tmf?,"  In a 2002 paper, the authors and Bruner used the new spectrum tmf to obtain
some new nonimmersions of real projective spaces. In this note, we
complete/correct two oversights in that paper.
  The first is to note that in that paper a general nonimmersion result was
stated which yielded new nonimmersions for RP^n with n as small as 48, and yet
it was stated there that the first new result occurred when n=1536. Here we
give a simple proof of those overlooked results.
  Secondly, we fill in a gap in the proof of the 2002 paper. There it was
claimed that an axial map f must satisfy f^*(X)=X_1+X_2. We realized recently
that this is not clear. However, here we show that it is true up multiplication
by a unit in the appropriate ring, and so we retrieve all the nonimmersion
results claimed in the original paper.
  Finally, we present a complete determination of tmf^{8*}(RP^\infty\times
RP^\infty) and tmf^*(CP^\infty\times CP^\infty) in positive dimensions.
"
What is the origin of HE energy cosmic-ray electrons?,"  We present here the capabilities of the GLAST Large Area Telescope to detect
cosmic ray high-energy (HE) electrons in the energy range from 10 GeV to 1 TeV.
We also discuss the science topics that can be investigated with HE electron
data and quantify the results with LAT instrument simulations. The science
topics include CR propagation, calibration of the IC gamma-ray model, testing
hypotheses regarding the origin of HE energy cosmic-ray electrons, searching
for any signature of Kaluza Klein Dark Matter annihilation, and measuring the
HE electron anisotropy. We expect to detect ~ 107 electrons above 20 GeV per
year of LAT operation.
"
What are the unphysical terms introduced in the equations of statistical equilibrium?,"  Context. A derivation of a generalized sqrt(epsilon)-law for nonthermal
collisional rates of excitation by charged perturbers is presented. Aims. Aim
of this paper is to find a more general analytical expression for a surface
value of the source function which can be used as an addtional tool for
verification of the non-LTE radiative transfer codes. Methods. Under the impact
approximation hypothesis, static, one-dimensional, plane-parallel atmosphere,
constant magnetic field of arbitrary strength and direction, two-level atom
model with unpolarized lower level and stimulated emission neglected, we
introduce the unphysical terms into the equations of statistical equilibrium
and solve the appropriate non-LTE integral equations. Results. We derive a new
analytical condition for the surface values of the source function components
expressed in the basis of irreducible spherical tensors.
"
What is the mechanism that induces charge density variations in corrugated graphene?,"  A new mechanism that induces charge density variations in corrugated graphene
is proposed. Here it is shown how the interplay between lattice deformations
and exchange interactions can induce charge separation, i.e., puddles of
electrons and holes, for realistic deformation values of the graphene sheet.
The induced charge density lies in the range of $10^{11}-10^{12}$ cm$^{-2}$,
which is compatible with recent measurements.
"
What are the XMM-Newton Reflection Grating Spectrometer observations of 16 type-I X-ray bursts from GS 1826-24?,"  During a 200 ks observation with the XMM-Newton Reflection Grating
Spectrometer, we detected 16 type-I X-ray bursts from GS 1826-24. We combined
the burst spectra in an attempt to measure the gravitational redshifts from the
surface of the neutron star. We divided the composite GS 1826-24 burst spectrum
into three groups based on the blackbody temperature during the bursts. The
spectra do not show any obvious discrete absorption lines. We compare our
observations with those of EXO 0748-676.
"
What is the structure of the four-dimensional Godel spacetime?,"  The four dimensional Godel spacetime is known to have the structure M_3 x R.
It is also known that the three-dimensional factor M_3 is an exact solution of
three-dimensional gravity coupled to a Maxwell-Chern-Simons theory. We build in
this paper a N=2 supergravity extension for this action and prove that the
Godel background preserves half of all supersymmetries.
"
What is the efficiency of AO diffraction in a-BaB2O4 at different powers of electric signal?,"  The efficiency of acoustooptic (AO) diffraction in a-BaB2O4 and Li2B4O7
crystals is studied experimentally. The crystals are shown to be quite good AO
materials. The efficiency of AO diffraction in a-BaB2O4 reaches h=30% at the
electric signal power of P=0.7W for the transverse acoustic wave and 15% at the
power of P=0.56W for the longitudinal wave. The same parameter for Li2B4O7
reaches h=21% at P=0,81W for the longitudinal acoustic wave.
"
What are the properties of weak X-ray flares in the context of stellar atmospheres?,"  Context: Weak flares are supposed to be an important heating agent of the
outer layers of stellar atmospheres. However, due to instrumental limitations,
only large X-ray flares have been studied in detail until now.
  Aims: We used an XMM-Newton observation of the very active BY-Dra type binary
star CC Eri in order to investigate the properties of two flares that are
weaker than those typically studied in the literature.
  Methods: We performed time-resolved spectroscopy of the data taken with the
EPIC-PN CCD camera. A multi-temperature model was used to fit the spectra. We
inferred the size of the flaring loops using the density-temperature diagram.
The loop scaling laws were applied for deriving physical parameters of the
flaring plasma. We also estimated the number of loops involved in the observed
flares.
  Results: A large X-ray variability was found. Spectral analysis showed that
all the regions in the light curve, including the flare segments, are
well-described by a 3-T model with variable emission measures but,
surprisingly, with constant temperatures (values of 3, 10 and 22 MK). The
analysed flares lasted ~ 3.4 and 7.1 ks, with flux increases of factors
1.5-1.9. They occurred in arcades made of a few tens of similar coronal loops.
The size of the flaring loops is much smaller than the distance between the
stellar surfaces in the binary system, and even smaller than the radius of each
of the stars. The obtained results are consistent with the following ideas: (i)
the whole X-ray light curve of CC Eri could be the result of a superposition of
multiple low-energy flares, and (ii) stellar flares can be scaled-up versions
of solar flares.
"
What are the key characteristics of the cosmic matter distribution that are preserved by the Delaunay Tessellation Field Estimator (DTFE)?,"  The lecture notes describe the Delaunay Tessellation Field Estimator for
Cosmic Web analysis. The high sensitivity of Voronoi/Delaunay tessellations to
the local point distribution is used to obtain estimates of density and related
quantities. The adaptive and minimum triangulation properties of Delaunay
tessellations are utilized for interpolation to continuous volume-covering
density and velocity fields. The adaptivity to the local density and geometry
preserves three key characteristics of the cosmic matter distribution: 1) its
hierarchical nature,2) its anisotropic weblike morphology, 3) the presence and
structure of voids. The lecture notes discuss the mathematical context and
background of the DTFE method, in essence a first order version of Natural
Neighbour methods, smooth and higher order spatial interpolation techniques.
This is followed by an outline of the DTFE procedure. A series of tests on
spatially complex point distributions provides quantitative information on its
performance and noise characteristics. We conclude with a few cosmological
applications. The reconstruction of the spatial weblike patterns in N-body
simulations and in the 2dFGRS provide a visual impression of DTFE's
performance. The analysis of the velocity divergence pdf and maps obtained of
the velocity flow in the Local Universe (implied by PSCz) illustrate its
promise for probing the dynamics of cosmic structure. The Watershed Void Finder
(Platen et al. 2007), for the study of voids, and Multiscale Morphology Filter
(Aragon-Calvo et al. 2007), for identifying and analyzing weblike networks of
filaments, sheets and clusters, are based upon DTFE density fields. We also
mention SimpleX, a related random lattice radiative transfer formalism
(Ritzerveld & Icke 2006).
"
What are the reasons for the h-index being a better predictor of future scientific achievement?,"  Bibliometric measures of individual scientific achievement are of particular
interest if they can be used to predict future achievement. Here we report
results of an empirical study of the predictive power of the h-index compared
to other indicators. Our findings indicate that the h-index is better than
other indicators considered (total citation count, citations per paper, and
total paper count) in predicting future scientific achievement. We discuss
reasons for the superiority of the h-index.
"
What are the implications of the GUT relation between the gaugino mass parameters M_1 and M_2 for the electroweak precision data and rare decays?,"  We show that in the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model, the mass of the
lightest neutralino is experimentally unconstrained if the GUT relation between
the gaugino mass parameters M_1 and M_2 is dropped. We discuss what the impact
of light or massless neutralinos would be on their production at LEP, as well
as on electroweak precision data and rare decays.
"
What is the method to controllably fuse gold nanoparticles between microfabricated electrodes?,"  Applying ac voltages, we trapped gold nanoparticles between microfabricated
electrodes under well-defined conditions. We demonstrate that the nanoparticles
can be controllably fused together to form homogeneous gold nanowires with
pre-defined diameters and conductance values. Whereas electromigration is known
to form a gap when a dc voltage is applied, this ac technique achieves the
opposite, thereby completing the toolkit for the fabrication of nanoscale
junctions.
"
How does self-assembly facilitate the inductive generalization of solutions?,"  We propose that genetic encoding of self-assembling components greatly
enhances the evolution of complex systems and provides an efficient platform
for inductive generalization, i.e. the inductive derivation of a solution to a
problem with a potentially infinite number of instances from a limited set of
test examples. We exemplify this in simulations by evolving scalable circuitry
for several problems. One of them, digital multiplication, has been intensively
studied in recent years, where hitherto the evolutionary design of only
specific small multipliers was achieved. The fact that this and other problems
can be solved in full generality employing self-assembly sheds light on the
evolutionary role of self-assembly in biology and is of relevance for the
design of complex systems in nano- and bionanotechnology.
"
What are the properties of the wavefunctions in the Klein-Gordon equation?,"  We find dispersion-free wavepacket solutions to the Klein-Gordon equation,
with the only free parameter being the wavepacket velocity $ {\bf v} $. These
wavefunctions are eigenvectors of a velocity operator with commuting components
which is symmetric in a certain scalar product space. We show that this
velocity operator corresponds to a classical generator which may be obtained by
a canonical tranformation from $ {\bf x}, {\bf k} $.
"
What is the relationship between the Tutte polynomial and the HOMFLY polynomial?,"  A celebrated result of F. Jaeger states that the Tutte polynomial of a planar
graph is determined by the HOMFLY polynomial of an associated link. Here we are
interested in the converse of this result. We consider the question `to what
extent does the Tutte polynomial determine the HOMFLY polynomial of any knot?'
We show that the HOMFLY polynomial of a knot is determined by Tutte polynomials
of plane graphs associated to the knot.
"
"What is the relationship between the observed size, thermal energy, and mass of galaxy clusters?","  Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) cluster surveys are considered among the most
promising methods for probing dark energy up to large redshifts. However, their
premise is hinged upon an accurate mass-observable relationship, which could be
affected by the (rather poorly understood) physics of the intracluster gas. In
this letter, using a semi-analytic model of the intracluster gas that
accommodates various theoretical uncertainties, I develop a Fundamental Plane
relationship between the observed size, thermal energy, and mass of galaxy
clusters. In particular, I find that M ~ (Y_{SZ}/R_{SZ,2})^{3/4}, where M is
the mass, Y_{SZ} is the total SZ flux or thermal energy, and R_{SZ,2} is the SZ
half-light radius of the cluster. I first show that, within this model, using
the Fundamental Plane relationship reduces the (systematic+random) errors in
mass estimates to 14%, from 22% for a simple mass-flux relationship. Since
measurement of the cluster sizes is an inevitable part of observing the SZ
clusters, the Fundamental Plane relationship can be used to reduce the error of
the cluster mass estimates by ~ 34%, improving the accuracy of the resulting
cosmological constraints without any extra cost. I then argue why our
Fundamental Plane is distinctly different from the virial relationship that one
may naively expect between the cluster parameters. Finally, I argue that while
including more details of the observed SZ profile cannot significantly improve
the accuracy of mass estimates, a better understanding of the impact of
non-gravitational heating/cooling processes on the outskirts of the
intracluster medium (apart from external calibrations) might be the best way to
reduce these errors.

What is the relationship between the three-body energy and the two-body energy of the $\bar{K}N$ interaction?,"  Coupled-channel three-body calculations of an $I=1/2$, $J^{\pi}=0^-$
$\bar{K}NN$ quasi-bound state in the $\bar{K}NN - \pi \Sigma N$ system were
performed and the dependence of the resulting three-body energy on the two-body
$\bar{K}N - \pi \Sigma$ interaction was investigated. Earlier results of
binding energy $B_{K^-pp} \sim 50 -70$ MeV and width $\Gamma_{K^-pp} \sim 100$
MeV are confirmed [N.V. Shevchenko {\it et al.}, Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 98},
082301 (2007)]. It is shown that a suitably constructed energy-independent
complex $\bar{K}N$ potential gives a considerably shallower and narrower
three-body quasi-bound state than the full coupled-channel calculation.
Comparison with other calculations is made.
"
What are the implications of the Lorentz invariance limits for electrons and photons in the context of the standard model extension?,"  We report Relativity tests based on data from two simultaneous
Michelson-Morley experiments, spanning a period of more than one year. Both
were actively rotated on turntables. One (in Berlin, Germany) uses optical
Fabry-Perot resonators made of fused silica; the other (in Perth, Australia)
uses microwave whispering-gallery sapphire resonators. Within the standard
model extension, we obtain simultaneous limits on Lorentz violation for
electrons (5 coefficients) and photons (8) at levels down to $10^{-16}$,
improved by factors between 3 and 50 compared to previous work.
"
What are the main drawbacks of fully-parallel manipulators in the presence of obstacles?,"  The aim of this paper is to characterize the moveability of fully-parallel
manipulators in the presence of obstacles. Fully parallel manipulators are used
in applications where accuracy, stiffness or high speeds and accelerations are
required \cite{Merlet:97}. However, one of its main drawbacks is a relatively
small workspace compared to the one of serial manipulators. This is due mainly
to the existence of potential internal collisions, and the existence of
singularities. In this paper, the notion of free aspect is defined which
permits to exhibit domains of the workspace and the joint space free of
singularity and collision. The main application of this study is the
moveability analysis in the workspace of the manipulator as well as
path-planning, control and design.
"
What is the Rashba spin-orbit coupling in the absence of an external field?,"  We study spin-dependent transport in a two-dimensional electron gas subject
to an external step-like potential $V(x)$ and irradiated by an electromagnetic
field (EF). In the absence of EF the electronic spectrum splits into spin
sub-bands originating from the ""Rashba"" spin-orbit coupling. We show that the
resonant interaction of propagating electrons with the component EF parallel to
the barrier induces a \textit{% non-equilibrium dynamic gap} $(2\Delta_{R})$
between the spin sub-bands. Existence of this gap results in coherent spin-flip
processes that lead to a spin-polarized current and a large magnetoresistance,
i.e the spin valve effect. These effects may be used for controlling spin
transport in semiconducting nanostructures, e.g. spin transistors,
spin-blockade devices etc., by variation of the intensity S and frequency
$\omega $ of the external radiation.
"
What is the connection between the slopes of the single functions describing the semileptonic decays of bc baryons and the semileptonic decays of Bc baryons?,"  We study the semileptonic decays of the lowest-lying bc baryons to the
lowest-lying cc baryons (Xi_{bc}^{(\prime*)}--> Xi_{cc}^{(*)} and
Omega_{bc}^{(\prime*)}--> Omega_{cc}^{(*)}), in the limit m_b, m_c >>
Lambda_{QCD} and close to the zero recoil point. The separate heavy quark spin
symmetries make it possible to describe all these decays using a single form
factor. We recover results derived previously by White and Savage in a manner
which we think is more straightforward and parallels the method applied later
to study Bc semileptonic decays. We further discuss the resemblance between the
bc baryon decays and those of Bc mesons to eta_c and J/\psi mesons and comment
on the relation between the slopes of the single functions describing each set
of decays. Our results can straightforwardly be applied to the decays of bb
baryons to bc baryons.
"
What are the regions in which the behavior of P(F) is universal or non-universal?,"  A modification of the optimal fluctuation approach is applied to study the
tails of the free energy distribution function P(F) for an elastic string in
quenched disorder both in the regions of the universal behavior of P(F) and in
the regions of large fluctuations, where the behavior of P(F) is non-universal.
The difference between the two regimes is shown to consist in whether it is
necessary or not to take into account the renormalization of parameters by the
fluctuations of disorder in the vicinity of the optimal fluctuation.
"
What are the functorial properties of a 2-cocycle?,"  We introduce a 2-cocycle for symplectic and skew-hermitian hyperbolic groups
over arbitrary fields and skew fields, with values in the Witt group of
hermitian forms. This cocycle has good functorial properties: it is natural
under extension of scalars and stable, so it can be viewed as a universal
2-dimensional characteristic class for these groups. Over R and C, it coincides
with the first Chern class.
"
What are the implications of the WDM particle mass on the CDM predictions on small scales?,"  Warm Dark Matter (WDM) has been invoked to resolve apparent conflicts of Cold
Dark Matter (CDM) models with observations on subgalactic scales. In this work
we provide a new and independent lower limit for the WDM particle mass (e.g.
sterile neutrino) through the analysis of image fluxes in gravitationally
lensed QSOs.
  Starting from a theoretical unperturbed cusp configuration we analyze the
effects of intergalactic haloes in modifying the fluxes of QSO multiple images,
giving rise to the so-called anomalous flux ratio. We found that the global
effect of such haloes strongly depends on their mass/abundance ratio and it is
maximized for haloes in the mass range $10^6-10^8 \Msun$.
  This result opens up a new possibility to constrain CDM predictions on small
scales and test different warm candidates, since free streaming of warm dark
matter particles can considerably dampen the matter power spectrum in this mass
range. As a consequence, while a ($\Lambda$)CDM model is able to produce flux
anomalies at a level similar to those observed, a WDM model, with an
insufficiently massive particle, fails to reproduce the observational
evidences.
  Our analysis suggests a lower limit of a few keV ($m_{\nu} \sim 10$) for the
mass of warm dark matter candidates in the form of a sterile neutrino. This
result makes sterile neutrino Warm Dark Matter less attractive as an
alternative to Cold Dark Matter, in good agreement with previous findings from
Lyman-$\alpha$ forest and Cosmic Microwave Background analysis.
"
What is the relationship between the classical and quantum treatment of the localization of bosonic atoms in an optical lattice?,"  We study the localization of bosonic atoms in an optical lattice, which
interact in a spatially confined region. The classical theory predicts that
there is no localization below a threshold value for the strength of
interaction that is inversely proportional to the number of participating
atoms. In a full quantum treatment, however, we find that localized states
exist for arbitrarily weak attractive or repulsive interactions for any number
($>1$) of atoms. We further show, using an explicit solution of the
two-particle bound state and an appropriate measure of entanglement, that the
entanglement tends to a finite value in the limit of weak interactions. Coupled
with the non-existence of localization in an optimized quantum product state,
we conclude that the localization exists by virtue of entanglement.

## Step 6: Future work,"  This paper has been withdrawn by the authors.
"
What are the implications of the chrono-geometrical structure of special relativity for the synchronization of distant clocks?,"  After a review of the chrono-geometrical structure of special relativity,
where the definition of the instantaneous 3-space is based on the
observer-dependent convention for the synchronization of distant clocks, it is
shown that in a class of models of general relativity the instantaneous 3-space
and the associated clock synchronization convention are dynamically determined
by Einstein's equations. This theoretical framework is necessary to understand
the relativistic effects around the Earth, to be tested with the ACES mission
of ESA, and the implications for metrology induced by the accuracy of the new
generation of atomic clocks.
"
What are the methods used to interpret asymmetries in solar flares?,"  For many years various asymmetrical profiles of different spectral lines
emitted from solar flares have been frequently observed. These asymmetries or
line shifts are caused predominantly by vertical mass motions in flaring layers
and they provide a good diagnostics for plasma flows during solar flares. There
are many controversial results of observations and theoretical analysis of
plasma flows in solar chromospheric flares. The main difficulty is the
interpretation of line shifts or asymmetries. For many years, methods based on
bisector techniques were used but they give a reliable results only for some
specific conditions and in most cases cannot be applied. The most promising
approach is to use the non-LTE techniques applied for flaring atmosphere. The
calculation of synthetic line profiles is performed with the radiative transfer
techniques and the assumed physical conditions correspond to flaring
atmosphere. I will present an overview of different observations and
interpretations of line asymmetries in chromospheric flares. I will explain
what we have learnt about the chromospheric evaporation in the frame of
hydrodynamical models as well as reconnection models. A critical review will be
done on the classical methods used to derive Doppler-shifts for optically thick
chomospheric lines. In particular, details on the new approach for interpreting
chromospheric line asymmetries based on the non-LTE techniques will be
presented.
"
What are the formulas for unsymmetrical and symmetrical one-range addition theorems of Slater-type orbitals?,"  Using one-center expansion relations for the Slater type orbitals (STOs) of
noninteger principal quantum numbers in terms of integer n STOs derived in this
study with the help of - exponential type orbitals (-ETOs, the general formulas
are established for the unsymmetrical and symmetrical one-range addition
theorems of STOs and Coulomb-Yukawa like correlated interaction potentials
(CIPs) with integer and noninteger indices. The final results are especially
useful for computations of arbitrary multicenter multielectron integrals over
STOs that arise in the Hartree-Fock-Roothaan (HFR) approximation and also in
the correlated methods which play a significant role in theory and application
to quantum mechanics of atoms, molecules, and solids.
"
What is the Byrd's box model used to present the semantics of Prolog tracers?,"  This report specifies an observational semantics and gives an original
presentation of the Byrd's box model. The approach accounts for the semantics
of Prolog tracers independently of a particular implementation. Traces are, in
general, considered as rather obscure and difficult to use. The proposed formal
presentation of a trace constitutes a simple and pedagogical approach for
teaching Prolog or for implementing Prolog tracers. It constitutes a form of
declarative specification for the tracers. Our approach highlights qualities of
the box model which made its success, but also its drawbacks and limits. As a
matter of fact, the presented semantics is only one example to illustrate
general problems relating to tracers and observing processes. Observing
processes know, from observed processes, only their traces. The issue is then
to be able to reconstitute by the sole analysis of the trace the main part of
the observed process, and if possible, without any loss of information.
"
What are the implications of the axial-vector Ward-Takahashi identity for neutral pseudoscalar mesons?,"  The axial-vector Ward-Takahashi identity is used to derive mass formulae for
neutral pseudoscalar mesons. Flavour symmetry breaking entails non-ideal
flavour content for these states. Adding that the \eta^\prime is not a
Goldstone mode, exact chiral-limit relations are developed from the identity.
They connect the dressed-quark propagator to the topological susceptibility. It
is confirmed that in the chiral limit the \eta^\prime mass is proportional to
the matrix element which connects this state to the vacuum via the topological
susceptibility. The implications of the mass formulae are illustrated using an
elementary dynamical model, which includes an Ansatz for that part of the
Bethe-Salpeter kernel related to the non-Abelian anomaly. In addition to the
current-quark masses, the model involves two parameters, one of which is a
mass-scale. It is employed in an analysis of pseudoscalar- and vector-meson
bound-states. While the effects of SU(N_f=2) and SU(N_f=3) flavour symmetry
breaking are emphasised, the five-flavour spectra are described. Despite its
simplicity, the model is elucidative and phenomenologically efficacious; e.g.,
it predicts \eta-\eta^\prime mixing angles of ~ (-15 degrees) and \pi^0-\eta
angles of ~ 1 degree.
"
What are the implications of the QCD axion in the 2-3 \mu eV mass range for the ADMX collaboration?,"  The Kaplan-Manohar ambiguity in light quark masses allows for a larger
uncertainty in the ratio of up to down quark masses than naive estimates from
the chiral Lagrangian would indicate. We show that it allows for a relaxation
of experimental bounds on the QCD axion, specifically KSVZ axions in the $2-3
\mu$eV mass range composing 100% of the galactic dark matter halo can evade the
experimental limits placed by the ADMX collaboration.
"
What is the dimension of families of singular curves with hyperelliptic normalizations on a surface S?,"  Under natural hypotheses we give an upper bound on the dimension of families
of singular curves with hyperelliptic normalizations on a surface S with p_g(S)
>0 via the study of the associated families of rational curves in Hilb^2(S).
  We use this result to prove the existence of nodal curves of geometric genus
3 with hyperelliptic normalizations, on a general K3 surface, thus obtaining
specific 2-dimensional families of rational curves in its Hilbert square. We
describe two infinite series of examples of general, primitively polarized K3's
such that their Hilbert squares contain a IP^2 or a threefold birational to a
IP^1-bundle over a K3.
  We discuss some consequences on the Mori cone of the Hilbert square of a
general K3.
"
What are the Cramer-Rao lower bound of the phase sensitivity?,"  We show that the phase sensitivity $\Delta \theta$ of a Mach-Zehnder
interferometer fed by a coherent state in one input port and squeezed-vacuum in
the other one is i) independent from the true value of the phase shift and ii)
can reach the Heisenberg limit $\Delta \theta \sim 1/N_T$, where $N_T$ is the
average number of particles of the input states. We also show that the
Cramer-Rao lower bound, $\Delta \theta \propto 1/ \sqrt{|\alpha|^2 e^{2r} +
\sinh^2r}$, can be saturated for arbitrary values of the squeezing parameter
$r$ and the amplitude of the coherent mode $|\alpha|$ by a Bayesian phase
inference protocol.
"
What are the constraints on masses of gauginos in the SUSY breaking model?,"  We study phenomenological features in an extended gauge mediation SUSY
breaking model which has non-universal gaugino masses and CP phases. We show
that large CP phases in soft SUSY breaking parameters can be consistent with
the constraints coming from the electric dipole moment (EDM) of an electron, a
neutron, and also a mercury atom. Masses of the superpartners are not
necessarily required to be larger than 1 TeV but allowed to be O(100) GeV. We
also investigate the mass spectrum of Higgs scalars and their couplings to
gauge bosons in that case. Compatibility of this model with the present
experimental data on the Higgs sector is discussed.
"
What are the effects of inhomogeneous distribution of thresholds on the propagation of perturbations in RTN?,"  We calculate analytically the critical connectivity $K_c$ of Random Threshold
Networks (RTN) for homogeneous and inhomogeneous thresholds, and confirm the
results by numerical simulations. We find a super-linear increase of $K_c$ with
the (average) absolute threshold $|h|$, which approaches $K_c(|h|) \sim
h^2/(2\ln{|h|})$ for large $|h|$, and show that this asymptotic scaling is
universal for RTN with Poissonian distributed connectivity and threshold
distributions with a variance that grows slower than $h^2$. Interestingly, we
find that inhomogeneous distribution of thresholds leads to increased
propagation of perturbations for sparsely connected networks, while for densely
connected networks damage is reduced; the cross-over point yields a novel,
characteristic connectivity $K_d$, that has no counterpart in Boolean networks.
Last, local correlations between node thresholds and in-degree are introduced.
Here, numerical simulations show that even weak (anti-)correlations can lead to
a transition from ordered to chaotic dynamics, and vice versa. It is shown that
the naive mean-field assumption typical for the annealed approximation leads to
false predictions in this case, since correlations between thresholds and
out-degree that emerge as a side-effect strongly modify damage propagation
behavior.
"
What is the role of the boundary conditions at the singularity in the stochastic law of particle creation and annihilation?,"  We develop an extension of Bohmian mechanics to a curved background
space-time containing a singularity. The present paper focuses on timelike
singularities. We use the naked timelike singularity of the super-critical
Reissner-Nordstrom geometry as an example. While one could impose boundary
conditions at the singularity that would prevent the particles from falling
into the singularity, we are interested here in the case in which particles
have positive probability to hit the singularity and get annihilated. The wish
for reversibility, equivariance, and the Markov property then dictates that
particles must also be created by the singularity, and indeed dictates the rate
at which this must occur. That is, a stochastic law prescribes what comes out
of the singularity. We specify explicit equations of a non-rigorous model
involving an interior-boundary condition on the wave function at the
singularity, which can be used also in other versions of quantum theory besides
Bohmian mechanics. As the resulting theory involves particle creation and
annihilation, it can be regarded as a quantum field theory, and the stochastic
process for the Bohmian particles is analogous to Bell-type quantum field
theories.
"
What is the effect of growth parameters on the lattice constants of the InN layer in an MOVPE system?,"  From a detailed analysis of InN epilayers deposited in a close-coupled
showerhead metalorganic vapour phase epitaxy (MOVPE) system under various
conditions we investigate the effect of growth parameters on the lattice
constants of the InN layer. The layers are under significant internal
hydrostatic stress which influences the optical properties. Samples typically
fall into two broad categories of stress, with resultant luminescence emission
around 0.8eV and 1.1eV. We can correlate the internal stress in the layer and
the value of the optical absorption edge, and the PL emission wavelength.
"
What is the relationship between the blowup time and the mass of the ground state?,"  We establish global well-posedness and scattering for solutions to the
mass-critical nonlinear Schr\""odinger equation $iu_t + \Delta u = \pm |u|^2 u$
for large spherically symmetric L^2_x(\R^2) initial data; in the focusing case
we require, of course, that the mass is strictly less than that of the ground
state. As a consequence, we deduce that in the focusing case, any spherically
symmetric blowup solution must concentrate at least the mass of the ground
state at the blowup time.
  We also establish some partial results towards the analogous claims in other
dimensions and without the assumption of spherical symmetry.
"
What is the relationship between the Gross-Neveu models and lattice QCD computations?,"  Gross-Neveu type models with a finite number of fermion flavours are studied
on a two-dimensional Euclidean space-time lattice. The models are
asymptotically free and are invariant under a chiral symmetry. These
similarities to QCD make them perfect benchmark systems for fermion actions
used in large scale lattice QCD computations. The Schroedinger functional for
the Gross-Neveu models is defined for both, Wilson and Ginsparg-Wilson
fermions, and shown to be renormalisable in 1-loop lattice perturbation theory.
In two dimensions four fermion interactions of the Gross-Neveu models have
dimensionless coupling constants. The symmetry properties of the four fermion
interaction terms and the relations among them are discussed. For Wilson
fermions chiral symmetry is explicitly broken and additional terms must be
included in the action. Chiral symmetry is restored up to cut-off effects by
tuning the bare mass and one of the couplings. The critical mass and the
symmetry restoring coupling are computed to second order in lattice
perturbation theory. This result is used in the 1-loop computation of the
renormalised couplings and the associated beta-functions. The renormalised
couplings are defined in terms of suitable boundary-to-boundary correlation
functions. In the computation the known first order coefficients of the
beta-functions are reproduced. One of the couplings is found to have a
vanishing beta-function. The calculation is repeated for the recently proposed
Schroedinger functional with exact chiral symmetry, i.e. Ginsparg-Wilson
fermions. The renormalisation pattern is found to be the same as in the Wilson
case. Using the regularisation dependent finite part of the renormalised
couplings, the ratio of the Lambda-parameters is computed.
"
Can a probability distribution be used to describe the paradoxical flavour of a system?,"  In this paper we present three simple applications of probability and
highlight and discuss their paradoxical flavour.
"
What is the lattice of Ioffe-Pritchard microtraps used to store ultracold atoms?,"  We have realized a two dimensional permanent magnetic lattice of
Ioffe-Pritchard microtraps for ultracold atoms. The lattice is formed by a
single 300 nm magnetized layer of FePt, patterned using optical lithography.
Our magnetic lattice consists of more than 15000 tightly confining microtraps
with a density of 1250 traps/mm$^2$. Simple analytical approximations for the
magnetic fields produced by the lattice are used to derive relevant trap
parameters. We load ultracold atoms into at least 30 lattice sites at a
distance of approximately 10 $\mu$m from the film surface. The present result
is an important first step towards quantum information processing with neutral
atoms in magnetic lattice potentials.
"
What is the model of localized electrons coupled with a fully quantized phonon mode used to describe the nonadiabatic transition in a molecule?,"  We study the dynamics of initial nucleation processes of photoinduced
structural change of molecular crystals. In order to describe the nonadiabatic
transition in each molecule, we employ a model of localized electrons coupled
with a fully quantized phonon mode, and the time-dependent Schr\""odinger
equation for the model is numerically solved. We found a minimal model to
describe the nucleation induced by injection of an excited state of a single
molecule in which multiple types of intermolecular interactions are required.
In this model coherently driven molecular distortion plays an important role in
the successive conversion of electronic states which leads to photoinduced
cooperative phenomena.
"
What is the relationship between Landauer principle and thermodynamics?,"  Upon reviewing the article by Allahverdyan and Nieuwenhuizen in PRE, we
conclude that neither the Landauer principle nor the counterexamples presented
by the authors have any relation (i) to thermodynamics, and (ii) to the
interdependence of nonstatistical quantum physics and thermodynamics.
"
What is the difference between the dichroism and the birefringence in the chameleon particles and the chameleon particles?,"  It was recently argued that the observed PVLAS anomaly can be explained by
chameleon field theories in which large deviations from Newton's law can be
avoided. Here we present the predictions for the dichroism and the
birefringence induced in the vacuum by a magnetic field in these models. We
show that chameleon particles behave very differently from standard axion-like
particles (ALPs). We find that, unlike ALPs, the chameleon particles are
confined within the experimental set-up. As a consequence, the birefringence is
always bigger than the dichroism in PVLAS-type experiments.
"
What are the trigonometric Rosen-Morse and hyperbolic Scarf potentials?,"  A connection between Romanovski polynomials and those polynomials that solve
the one-dimensional Schr\""odinger equation with the trigonometric Rosen-Morse
and hyperbolic Scarf potential is established. The map is constructed by
reworking the Rodrigues formula in an elementary and natural way. The
generating function is summed in closed form from which recursion relations and
addition theorems follow. Relations to some classical polynomials are also
given.
"
What are the implications of the small grain size on Mars for the formation of Martian dunes?,"  It is now an accepted fact that the size at which dunes form from a flat sand
bed as well as their `minimal size' scales on the flux saturation length. This
length is by definition the relaxation length of the slowest mode toward
equilibrium transport. The model presented by Parteli, Duran and Herrmann
[Phys. Rev. E 75, 011301 (2007)] predicts that the saturation length decreases
to zero as the inverse of the wind shear stress far from the threshold. We
first show that their model is not self-consistent: even under large wind, the
relaxation rate is limited by grain inertia and thus can not decrease to zero.
A key argument presented by these authors comes from the discussion of the
typical dune wavelength on Mars (650 m) on the basis of which they refute the
scaling of the dune size with the drag length evidenced by Claudin and
Andreotti [Earth Pla. Sci. Lett. 252, 30 (2006)]. They instead propose that
Martian dunes, composed of large grains (500 micrometers), were formed in the
past under very strong winds. We show that this saltating grain size, estimated
from thermal diffusion measurements, is not reliable. Moreover, the microscopic
photographs taken by the rovers on Martian aeolian bedforms show a grain size
of 87 plus or minus 25 micrometers together with hematite spherules at
millimetre scale. As those so-called ``blueberries'' can not be entrained by
reasonable winds, we conclude that the saltating grains on Mars are the small
ones, which gives a second strong argument against the model of Parteli et al.
"
What is the accuracy of astrometric measurements with the VLT/FORS1 camera?,"  We investigate the accuracy of astrometric measurements with the VLT/FORS1
camera and consider potential applications. The study is based on two-epoch
(2000 and 2002/2003) frame series of observations of a selected Galactic Bulge
sky region that were obtained with FORS1 during four consecutive nights each.
Reductions were carried out with a novel technique that eliminates atmospheric
image motion and does not require a distinction between targets and reference
objects. The positional astrometric precision was found to be limited only by
the accuracy of the determination of the star photocentre, which is typically
200-300 microarcsec per single measurement for bright unsaturated stars
B=18-19. Several statistical tests have shown that at time-scales of 1-4 nights
the residual noise in measured positions is essentially a white noise with no
systematic instrumental signature and no significant deviation from a Gaussian
distribution. Some evidence of a good astrometric quality of the VLT for frames
separated by two years has also been found. Our data show that the VLT with
FORS1/2 cameras can be effectively used for astrometric observations of
planetary microlensing events and other applications where a high accuracy is
required, that is expected to reach 30-40 microarcsec for a series of 50 frames
(one hours with R filter).
"
What are the Liouville operators for the first- and second-order symplectic integrators for a one-dimensional harmonic-oscillator system?,"  Effective Liouville operators of the first- and the second-order symplectic
integrators are obtained for the one-dimensional harmonic-oscillator system.
The operators are defined only when the time step is less than two. Absolute
values of the coordinate and the momentum monotonically increase for large time
steps.
"
What are the effects of the quantum Bohm potential on the shape of solitary magnetosonic waves in quantum magnetohydrodynamics?,"  Starting from the governing equations for a quantum magnetoplasma including
the quantum Bohm potential and electron spin-1/2 effects, we show that the
system of quantum magnetohydrodynamic (QMHD) equations admit rarefactive
solitons due to the balance between nonlinearities and quantum
diffraction/tunneling effects. It is found that the electron spin-1/2 effect
introduces a pressure-like term with negative sign in the QMHD equations, which
modifies the shape of the solitary magnetosonic waves and makes them wider and
shallower. Numerical simulations of the time-dependent system shows the
development of rarefactive QMHD solitary waves that are modified by the spin
effects.
"
How does the new photometry at 16 microns and 22 microns from Spitzer IRS affect the interpretation of the galaxy's properties?,"  The Hubble Ultra Deep Field source JD2 presented in Mobasher et al. (2005) is
an unusual galaxy that is very faint at all wavelengths shortward of 1.1
micron. Photometric redshift fits to data at 0.4 to 8 microns yield a
significant probability that it is an extremely massive galaxy at z~6.5. In
this paper we present new photometry at 16 microns and 22 micron from Spitzer
Infrared Spectrograph (IRS) peak-up imaging of the Great Observatories Origins
Deep Survey (GOODS) fields. We find that the spectral energy distribution shows
a factor of ~4 rise in flux density between the 16 micron and 22 micron
bandpass which is most likely due to the entrance of polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbon emission features into the 22 micron and 24 micron passbands. The
flux ratio between these bandpasses can be best fit by a z~1.7 luminous
infrared galaxy with a bolometric luminosity of (2-6)\times10^{11} L_sun
corresponding to a star-formation rate of 80 M_sun/yr. The predicted flux
density values at other longer wavelengths are below the detection limits of
current instrumentation but such sources could potentially be detected in
lensed submillimeter surveys. Re-evaluation of the optical/near-infrared
photometry continues to favor z>6 photometric redshift solutions, but we argue
that the consistency of the multiwavelength parameters of this galaxy with
other dusty starbursts favor the z~2 mid-infrared photometric redshift. The
data presented here provide evidence that optically undetected near-infrared
sources which are detected at 24 microns are most likely dusty, starburst
galaxies at a redshift of z~2 with stellar masses >10^{10} M_sun.
"
What is the behavior of particles at a neat interface between two media?,"  In this paper we investigate the behavior of particles crossing a neat
interface between two media. A Monte Carlo and analytical model, based on
fractional derivatives, are presented and discussed in detail, together with a
comparison. Anomalous and normal diffusion are consdered.
"
What is the jacobian of a genus two hyperelliptic curve?,"  We consider an integrable system in five unknowns having three quartics
invariants. We show that the complex affine variety defined by putting these
invariants equal to generic constants, completes into an abelian surface; the
jacobian of a genus two hyperelliptic curve. This system is algebraic
completely integrable and it can be integrated in genus two hyperelliptic
functions.
"
What is the relationship between quantum computing and Nash Equilibrium?,"  In this paper we review our earlier work on quantum computing and the Nash
Equilibrium, in particular, tracing the history of the discovery of new Nash
Equilibria and then reviewing the ways in which quantum computing may be
expected to generate new classes of Nash equilibria. We then extend this work
through a substantive analysis of examples provided by Meyer, Flitney, Iqbal
and Weigert and Cheon and Tsutsui with respect to quantized games, quantum game
strategies and the extension of Nash Equilibrium to solvable games in Hilbert
space. Finally, we review earlier work by Sato, Taiji and Ikegami on non-linear
computation and computational classes by way of reference to coherence,
decoherence and quantum computating systems.
"
What are the key ideas in the background of approaches to field theories for D-branes?,"  In connection with the space-time uncertainty principle which gives a simple
qualitative characterization of non-local or non-commutative nature of
short-distance space-time structure in string theory, author's recent
approaches toward field theories for D-branes are briefly outlined, putting
emphasis on some key ideas lying in the background. The final section of the
present report is devoted partially to a tribute to Yukawa on the occasion of
the centennial of his birth.
"
What are the conditions for the tunneling process to become quasiperiodic?,"  We study the tunneling of a two-level atom in a double well potential while
the atom is coupled to a single electromagnetic field mode of a cavity. The
coupling between internal and external degrees of freedom, due to the
mechanical effect on the atom from photon emission into the cavity mode, can
dramatically change the tunneling behavior. We predict that in general the
tunneling process becomes quasiperiodic. In a certain regime of parameters a
collapse and revival of the tunneling occurs. Accessing the internal degrees of
freedom of the atom with a laser allows to coherently manipulate the atom
position, and in particular to prepare the atom in one of the two wells. The
effects described should be observable with atoms in an optical double well
trap.
"
What is the main features of the QLib package?,"  Developing intuition about quantum information theory problems is difficult,
as is verifying or ruling-out of hypothesis. We present a Matlab package
intended to provide the QIT community with a new and powerful tool-set for
quantum information theory calculations. The package covers most of the ""QI
textbook"" and includes novel parametrization of quantum objects and a robust
optimization mechanism. New ways of re-examining well-known results is
demonstrated. QLib is designed to be further developed and enhanced by the
community and is available for download at www.qlib.info

What is the novel learning method proposed for a mixture of recurrent neural networks?,"  This paper proposes a novel learning method for a mixture of recurrent neural
network (RNN) experts model, which can acquire the ability to generate desired
sequences by dynamically switching between experts. Our method is based on
maximum likelihood estimation, using a gradient descent algorithm. This
approach is similar to that used in conventional methods; however, we modify
the likelihood function by adding a mechanism to alter the variance for each
expert. The proposed method is demonstrated to successfully learn Markov chain
switching among a set of 9 Lissajous curves, for which the conventional method
fails. The learning performance, analyzed in terms of the generalization
capability, of the proposed method is also shown to be superior to that of the
conventional method. With the addition of a gating network, the proposed method
is successfully applied to the learning of sensory-motor flows for a small
humanoid robot as a realistic problem of time series prediction and generation.
"
What are the properties of isoperiodic potentials and their quantum analogs?,"  One-dimensional isoperiodic classical systems have been first analyzed by
Abel. Abel's characterization can be extended for singular potentials and
potentials which are not defined on the whole real line. The standard shear
equivalence of isoperiodic potentials can also be extended by using reflection
and inversion transformations. We provide a full characterization of
isoperiodic rational potentials showing that they are connected by
translations, reflections or Joukowski transformations. Upon quantization many
of these isoperiodic systems fail to exhibit identical quantum energy spectra.
This anomaly occurs at order O(h^2) because semiclassical corrections of energy
levels of order O(h) are identical for all isoperiodic systems. We analyze
families of systems where this quantum anomaly occurs and some special systems
where the spectral identity is preserved by quantization. Conversely, we point
out the existence of isospectral quantum systems which do not correspond to
isoperiodic classical systems.
"
What is the halting scheme for quantum Turing machines?,"  The paper considers the halting scheme for quantum Turing machines. The
scheme originally proposed by Deutsch appears to be correct, but not exactly as
originally intended. We discuss the result of Ozawa as well as the objections
raised by Myers, Kieu and Danos and others. Finally, the relationship of the
halting scheme to the quest for a universal quantum Turing machine is
considered.
"
What is the lower bound to the energy of physical states in QED in a manifestly covariant gauge?,"  In quantum field theory it is generally assumed that there is a lower bound
to the energy of a quantum state. Here, it will be shown that there is no lower
bound to the energy of physical states in QED in a manifestly covariant gauge.
"
What are the indications of jets and satellites in Compact Binary Supersoft X-Ray sources?,"  Some of the luminous Compact Binary Supersoft X-Ray sources (CBSS) have shown
indications of jets, also called satellites due to their appearance in the
spectra. In V Sagittae (V Sge) stars, the galactic counterparts of the CBSS,
such features have been reported only for WX Cen. If V Sge stars are indeed the
analogs of CBSS, one may expect transient jet emission in other objects of this
class. Spectroscopic observations of the V Sge star V617 Sgr have been made,
both at high photometric state and at decline. We show that V617 Sgr presents
Halpha satellites at high photometric state with velocities of +/-780 km/s.
This feature confirms, once more, the CBSS nature of the V Sge stars, however
the details of the spectral characteristics also suggest that the two groups of
stars display some intrinsic spectroscopic differences, which are likely to be
due to a selection effect related to chemical abundance.
"
What is the observed correlation in Au+Au collisions indicating the presence of conical emission?,"  We present results from STAR on 3-particle azimuthal correlations for a
$3<p_T<4$ GeV/c trigger particle with two softer $1<p_T<2$ GeV/c particles.
Results are shown for pp, d+Au and high statistics Au+Au collisions at
$\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200 GeV$. We observe a 3-particle correlation in central Au+Au
collisions which may indicate the presence of conical emission. In addition,
the dependence of the observed signal angular position on the $p_T$ of the
associated particles can be used to distinguish conical flow from simple
QCD-\v{C}erenkov radiation. An important aspect of the analysis is the
subtraction of combinatorial backgrounds. Systematic uncertainties due to this
subtraction and the flow harmonics $v_2$ and $v_4$ are investigated in detail.
"
What is the Planetary Orbit Fitting Process (POFP) used to investigate the orbital properties of a star-planetary system?,"  The body of work presented here revolves around the investigation of the
existence and nature of extra-solar planetary systems. The fitting of stellar
radial velocity time series data is attempted by constructing a model to
quantify the orbital properties of a star-planetary system. This is achieved
with the Planetary Orbit Fitting Process (POFP). Though specific to the
investigated problem, the POFP is founded on two separate, more general ideas.
One is a Solver producing the gravitational dynamics of a Three-Body system by
integrating its Newtonian equations of motion. The other is an independent
optimisation scheme. Both have been devised using MATLAB. Applying the
optimisation to the Solver results in a realistic Three-Body dynamics that best
describes the radial velocity data under the model-specific
orbital-observational constraints. Combining these aspects also allows for the
study of dynamical instability derived from interaction, which is reaffirmed as
a necessary criterion for evaluating the fit. The validity of POFP solutions
with respect to the observations and other models is discussed in this context.
The underlying generality and fundamental principles demonstrate a larger frame
of operation where problems in Physics and Mathematics can be solved with a
multitude of techniques.
"
What is the electronic shot noise of a quantum point contact measured by the microwave photovoltage technique?,"  We report on direct measurements of the electronic shot noise of a quantum
point contact at frequencies nu in the range 4-8 GHz. The very small energy
scale used ensures energy independent transmissions of the few transmitted
electronic modes and their accurate knowledge. Both the thermal energy and the
quantum point contact drain-source voltage Vds are comparable to the photon
energy hnu leading to observation of the shot noise suppression when
$V_{ds}<h\nu/e$. Our measurements provide the first complete test of the finite
frequency shot noise scattering theory without adjustable parameters.
"
What is the relationship between luminosity and temperature at fixed mass in galaxy clusters?,"  We explore how the behavior of galaxy cluster scaling relations are affected
by flux-limited selection biases and intrinsic covariance among observable
properties. Our models presume log-normal covariance between luminosity (L) and
temperature (T) at fixed mass (M), centered on evolving, power-law mean
relations as a function of host halo mass. Selection can mimic evolution; the
\lm and \lt relations from shallow X-ray flux-limited samples will deviate from
mass-limited expectations at nearly all scales while the relations from deep
surveys ($10^{-14} \cgsflux$) become complete, and therefore unbiased, at
masses above $\sims 2 \times 10^{14} \hinv \msol$. We derive expressions for
low-order moments of the luminosity distribution at fixed temperature, and show
that the slope and scatter of the \lt relation observed in flux-limited samples
is sensitive to the assumed \lt correlation coefficient. In addition, \lt
covariance affects the redshift behavior of halo counts and mean luminosity in
a manner that is nearly degenerate with intrinsic population evolution.
"
What are the connections between Jacobi forms and Weil representations?,"  Jacobi forms can be considered as vector valued modular forms, and Jacobi
forms of critical weight correspond to vector valued modular forms of weight
$\frac12$. Since the only modular forms of weight $\frac12$ on congruence
subgroups of $\SL$ are theta series the theory of Jacobi forms of critical
weight is intimately related to the theory of Weil representations of finite
quadratic modules. This article explains this relation in detail, gives an
account of various facts about Weil representations which are useful in this
context, and it gives some applications of the theory developed herein by
proving various vanishing theorems and by proving a conjecture on Jacobi forms
of weight one on $\SL$ with character.
"
What are the applications of supersymmetric N=2 solutions for the generalized Monge-Ampère equation?,"  We consider supersymmetric N=2 solutions with non-vanishing NS three-form.
Building on worldsheet results, we reduce the problem to a single generalized
Monge-Ampere equation on the generalized Kaehler potential K recently
interpreted geometrically by Lindstrom, Rocek, Von Unge and Zabzine. One input
in the procedure is a holomorphic function w that can be thought of as the
effective superpotential for a D3 brane probe. The procedure is hence likely to
be useful for finding gravity duals to field theories with non-vanishing
abelian superpotential, such as Leigh-Strassler theories. We indeed show that a
purely NS precursor of the Lunin-Maldacena dual to the beta-deformed N=4
super-Yang-Mills falls in our class.
"
What is the connection between nilpotent polynomials and the vanishing conjecture for 2nd order homogeneous differential operators?,"  In the recent progress [BE1], [Me] and [Z2], the well-known JC (Jacobian
conjecture) ([BCW], [E]) has been reduced to a VC (vanishing conjecture) on the
Laplace operators and HN (Hessian nilpotent) polynomials (the polynomials whose
Hessian matrix are nilpotent). In this paper, we first show that the vanishing
conjecture above, hence also the JC, is equivalent to a vanishing conjecture
for all 2nd order homogeneous differential operators $\Lambda$ and
$\Lambda$-nilpotent polynomials $P$ (the polynomials $P(z)$ satisfying
$\Lambda^m P^m=0$ for all $m\ge 1$). We then transform some results in the
literature on the JC, HN polynomials and the VC of the Laplace operators to
certain results on $\Lambda$-nilpotent polynomials and the associated VC for
2nd order homogeneous differential operators $\Lambda$. This part of the paper
can also be read as a short survey on HN polynomials and the associated VC in
the more general setting. Finally, we discuss a still-to-be-understood
connection of $\Lambda$-nilpotent polynomials in general with the classical
orthogonal polynomials in one or more variables. This connection provides a
conceptual understanding for the isotropic properties of homogeneous
$\Lambda$-nilpotent polynomials for the 2nd order homogeneous full rank
differential operators $\Lambda$ with constant coefficients.
"
What is the current understanding of the scale-invariant power spectrum?,"  I discuss the current status of inflationary cosmology in light of the recent
WMAP 3-year data release. The basic predictions of inflation are all supported
by the data. Inflation also makes predictions which have not been well tested
by current data but can be by future experiments, most notably a deviation from
a scale-invariant power spectrum and the production of primordial gravitational
waves. A scale-invariant spectrum is disfavored by current data, but not
conclusively. Tensor modes are currently poorly constrained, and slow-roll
inflation does not make an unambiguous prediction of the expected amplitude of
primordial gravitational waves. A tensor/scalar ratio of $r \simeq 0.01$ is
within reach of near-future measurements.
"
What are the manifestations of Kaluza-Klein excitations in the Randall-Sundrum extra dimensional model at the LHC?,"  We consider the Randall-Sundrum extra dimensional model with fields
propagating in the bulk based on an extended electroweak gauge symmetry with
specific fermion charges and localizations that allow to explain the LEP
anomaly of the forward--backward asymmetry for $b$--quarks, $A_{FB}^b$. We
study the manifestations of the strongly--interacting and electroweak gauge
boson Kaluza--Klein excitations $\vkk$ at the LHC, with masses of the order of
a few TeV, which dominantly decays into top and bottom quark pairs. We first
analyze the two--body tree--level production processes $pp \to t\bar t$ and
$b\bar b$ in which the Kaluza--Klein (KK) excitations of gauge bosons are
exchanged. We find that the additional channels can lead to a significant
excess of events with respect to the Standard Model prediction; characteristic
top quark polarization and angular asymmetries are quantitatively studied and
turn out to probe the chiral structure of couplings to excited states. We then
analyze higher order production processes for the gauge boson excitations which
have too weak or no couplings to light quarks and, in particular, the loop
induced process $gg \to \vkk \to t\bar t$ and $b\bar b$ in which the anomalous
$gg \vkk $ four--dimensional vertex has to be regulated. The RS effects in this
process, as well as in the four--body reactions $pp \to t\bar t b\bar b$,
$t\bar t t\bar t$, $b\bar b b\bar b$ and in the related three--body reactions
$gb \to b t \bar t$, $b b\bar b$, in which the $\vkk$ excitations are mainly
radiated off the eavy quarks, are shown to be potentially difficult to test at
LHC, due to small hase space and low parton density for $\mkk \gsim 3$ TeV.
"
What is the relationship between the Poland-Scheraga model and the Fokker-Planck equation?,"  We study the dynamics of denaturation bubbles in double-stranded DNA on the
basis of the Poland-Scheraga model. We show that long time distributions for
the survival of DNA bubbles and the size autocorrelation function can be
derived from an asymptotic weak noise approach. In particular, below the
melting temperature the bubble closure corresponds to a noisy finite time
singularity. We demonstrate that the associated Fokker-Planck equation is
equivalent to a quantum Coulomb problem. Below the melting temperature the
bubble lifetime is associated with the continuum of scattering states of the
repulsive Coulomb potential; at the melting temperature the Coulomb potential
vanishes and the underlying first exit dynamics exhibits a long time power law
tail; above the melting temperature, corresponding to an attractive Coulomb
potential, the long time dynamics is controlled by the lowest bound state.
Correlations and finite size effects are discussed.
"
What is the experimental method used to determine the temperature evolution of the number of molecules in supercooled liquids?,"  We use recently introduced three-point dynamic susceptibilities to obtain an
experimental determination of the temperature evolution of the number of
molecules, N_corr, that are dynamically correlated during the structural
relaxation of supercooled liquids. We first discuss in detail the physical
content of three-point functions that relate the sensitivity of the averaged
two-time dynamics to external control parameters (such as temperature or
density), as well as their connection to the more standard four-point dynamic
susceptibility associated with dynamical heterogeneities. We then demonstrate
that these functions can be experimentally determined with a good precision. We
gather available data to obtain the temperature dependence of N_corr for a
large number of supercooled liquids over a wide range of relaxation timescales
from the glass transition up to the onset of slow dynamics. We find that N_corr
systematically grows when approaching the glass transition. It does so in a
modest manner close to the glass transition, which is consistent with an
activation-based picture of the dynamics in glassforming materials. For higher
temperatures, there appears to be a regime where N_corr behaves as a power-law
of the relaxation time. Finally, we find that the dynamic response to density,
while being smaller than the dynamic response to temperature, behaves
similarly, in agreement with theoretical expectations.
"
"What is the supersolid characterized by the (x, -x, 0) ordering pattern in the t-t'V model?","  We study the properties of t-t'-V model of hard-core bosons on the triangular
lattice that can be realized in optical lattices. By mapping to the spin-1/2
XXZ model in a field, we determine the phase diagram of the t-V model where the
supersolid characterized by the ordering pattern (x,x,-2x') (""ferrimagnetic"" or
SS A) is a ground state for chemical potential \mu >3V. By turning on either
temperature or t' at half-filling \mu =3V, we find a first order transition
from SS A to the elusive supersolid characterized by the (x,-x,0) ordering
pattern (""antiferromagnetic"" or SS C). In addition, we find a large region
where a superfluid phase becomes a solid upon raising temperature at fixed
chemical potential. This is an analog of the Pomeranchuk effect driven by the
large entropic effects associated with geometric frustration on the triangular
lattice.
"
How is the formula of Krawczyk and Speicher extended to the second order case?,"  We derive a formula which expresses a second order cumulant whose entries are
products as a sum of cumulants where the entries are single factors. This
extends to the second order case the formula of Krawczyk and Speicher. We apply
our result to the problem of calculating the second order cumulants of a
semi-circular and Haar unitary operator.
"
What is the origin of the spectral lines observed in the 2.3-4.6 micron spectrum of HR 4049?,"  High-resolution infrared spectroscopy in the 2.3-4.6 micron region is
reported for the peculiar A supergiant, single-lined spectroscopic binary HR
4049. Lines from the CO fundamental and first overtone, OH fundamental, and
several H2O vibration-rotation transitions have been observed in the
near-infrared spectrum. The spectrum of HR 4049 appears principally in emission
through the 3 and 4.6 micron region and in absorption in the 2 micron region.
The 4.6 micron spectrum shows a rich 'forest' of emission lines. All the
spectral lines observed in the 2.3-4.6 micron spectrum are shown to be
circumbinary in origin. The presence of OH and H2O lines confirm the
oxygen-rich nature of the circumbinary gas which is in contrast to the
previously detected carbon-rich material. The emission and absorption line
profiles show that the circumbinary gas is located in a thin, rotating layer
near the dust disk. The properties of the dust and gas circumbinary disk and
the spectroscopic orbit yield masses for the individual stars, M_AI~0.58 Msolar
and M_MV~0.34 Msolar. Gas in the disk also has an outward flow with a velocity
of $\gtrsim$ 1 km/s. The severe depletion of refractory elements but near-solar
abundances of volatile elements observed in HR 4049 results from abundance
winnowing. The separation of the volatiles from the grains in the disk and the
subsequent accretion by the star are discussed. Contrary to prior reports, the
HR 4049 carbon and oxygen isotopic abundances are typical AGB values:
12C/13C=6^{+9}_{-4} and 16O/17O>200.
"
What are the effects of finite-size effects on the spectral-weight transfer in the Hubbard model?,"  Evolution of the hole spectral function along the Gamma-(pi,pi) cut is
studied in the antiferromagnetic state of the Hubbard model. The kink in the
calculated hole dispersion, the sharp spectral-weight transfer between the
branches, and the drastically suppressed coherent spectral weight near k=(0,0),
as observed recently in the high-resolution ARPES studies of cuprate
antiferromagnets, are shown to be strongly enhanced by finite-U
double-occupancy effects. Together with the anomalous spin-wave dispersion
observed earlier in high-resolution neutron-scattering studies, the present
study provides further evidence of a unified description of magnetic and
electronic excitations in cuprate antiferromagnets in terms of the Hubbard
model.
"
How do inhomogeneities in the local charge carrier density $\rho$ of $CuO_2$ planes affect the upper critical field $H_{c2}$?,"  The upper critical field $H_{c2}$ is one of the many non conventional
properties of high-$T_c$ cuprates. It is possible that the $H_{c2}(T)$
anomalies are due to the presence of inhomogeneities in the local charge
carrier density $\rho$ of the $CuO_2$ planes. In order to study this point, we
have prepared good quality samples of polycrystalline $La_{2-x}Sr_xCuO_{4}$
using the wet-chemical method, which has demonstrated to produce samples with a
better cation distribution. In particular, we have studied the temperature
dependence of the second critical field, $H_{c2}(T)$, through the magnetization
measurements on two samples with opposite average carrier concentration
($\rho_m=x$) and nearly the same critical temperature, namely $\rho_m = 0.08$
(underdoped) and $\rho_m = 0.25$ (overdoped). The results close to $T_c$ do not
follow the usual Ginzburg-Landau theory and are interpreted by a theory which
takes into account the influence of the inhomogeneities.
"
What are the theoretical predictions for the cross-section of high-mass electron-muon pair production at the Tevatron and the LHC?,"  We present the theoretical predictions up to QCD NLO for the cross section of
high-mass electron-muon pair production at the Tevatron and the LHC,
considering only the dominant contributions from the third-generation
sneutrino. The dependence of the renormalization and factorization scales on
the total cross section, and the effects on the K-factor due to the uncertainty
of parton distribution function(PDF) have been carefully investigated. By
considering soft-gluon resummation effects to all order in $\alpha_s$ of
leading logarithm, we present the transverse momentum distributions of the
final $e\mu$ pair.
"
What are the isotropic conditions for the Jacobian matrix that lead to isotropic configurations in manipulators?,"  Various performance indices are used for the design of serial manipulators.
One method of optimization relies on the condition number of the Jacobian
matrix. The minimization of the condition number leads, under certain
conditions, to isotropic configurations, for which the roundoff-error
amplification is lowest. In this paper, the isotropy conditions, introduced
elsewhere, are the motivation behind the introduction of isotropic sets of
points. By connecting together these points, we define families of isotropic
manipulators. This paper is devoted to planar manipulators, the concepts being
currently extended to their spatial counterparts. Furthermore, only
manipulators with revolute joints are considered here.
"
What are the Ewald sums for Yukawa potentials in systems with periodic boundary conditions in only two directions?,"  Yukawa potentials are often used as effective potentials for systems as
colloids, plasmas, etc. When the Debye screening length is large, the Yukawa
potential tends to the non-screened Coulomb potential ; in this small screening
limit, or Coulomb limit, the potential is long ranged. As it is well known in
computer simulation, a simple truncation of the long ranged potential and the
minimum image convention are insufficient to obtain accurate numerical data on
systems. The Ewald method for bulk systems, i.e. with periodic boundary
conditions in all three directions of the space, has already been derived for
Yukawa potential [cf. Y., Rosenfeld, {\it Mol. Phys.}, \bm{88}, 1357, (1996)
and G., Salin and J.-M., Caillol, {\it J. Chem. Phys.}, \bm{113}, 10459,
(2000)], but for systems with partial periodic boundary conditions, the Ewald
sums have only recently been obtained [M., Mazars, {\it J. Chem. Phys.}, {\bf
126}, 056101 (2007)]. In this paper, we provide a closed derivation of the
Ewald sums for Yukawa potentials in systems with periodic boundary conditions
in only two directions and for any value of the Debye length. A special
attention is paid to the Coulomb limit and its relation with the
electroneutrality of systems.
"
What is the relationship between the Witt group of hermitian forms and the Chern class?,"  We introduce a 2-cocycle for symplectic and skew-hermitian hyperbolic groups
over arbitrary fields and skew fields, with values in the Witt group of
hermitian forms. This cocycle has good functorial properties: it is natural
under extension of scalars and stable, so it can be viewed as a universal
2-dimensional characteristic class for these groups. Over R and C, it coincides
with the first Chern class.
"
What is the relationship between the entropy distribution of the intracluster gas and the accretion history of the gas and processes of feedback?,"  [Abridged] The entropy distribution of the intracluster gas reflects both
accretion history of the gas and processes of feedback which provide a further
non-gravitational energy besides the potential one. In this work, we study the
profiles and the scaling properties of the gas entropy in 24 hot (kT_{gas} > 6
keV) galaxy clusters observed with Chandra in the redshift range 0.14-0.82 and
showing different states of relaxation. We recover the gas density, temperature
and entropy profiles in a non-parametric way. Adding the hydrostatic
equilibrium hypothesis, radial profiles are also obtained from the deprojection
of the surface brightness, allowing to verify whether the hydrostatic
equilibrium is a tenable hypothesis by comparison with the spectral
measurements. We confirm that this is the case on scales larger than 100 kpc
and discuss the deviations observed in few non-cooling core clusters in the
inner regions. We show that the entropy profiles are remarkably similar outside
the core and can be described by simple power-laws with slope of 1.0-1.2. We
measure an entropy level at 0.1 R_{200} of 100-500 keV cm^2 and a central
plateau which spans a wide range of value (~ a few-200 keV cm^2) depending on
the state of relaxation of the source. To characterize the energetic of the
central regions, we compare the radial behaviour of the temperature of the gas
with the temperature of the dark matter T_{DM} by estimating the excess of
energy Delta E = 3/2 k(T_{gas}- T_{DM}). We point out that Delta E ranges from
~ 0 in typical cooling-core clusters to few keV within 100 kpc in non-cooling
core systems. We also measure a significant correlation between the total iron
mass and the entropy outside the cooling region,whereas in the inner regions
they anti-correlate strongly.
"
What are the new methods proposed for the numerical continuation of point-to-cycle connecting orbits in 3-dimensional autonomous ODE's?,"  We propose new methods for the numerical continuation of point-to-cycle
connecting orbits in 3-dimensional autonomous ODE's using projection boundary
conditions. In our approach, the projection boundary conditions near the cycle
are formulated using an eigenfunction of the associated adjoint variational
equation, avoiding costly and numerically unstable computations of the
monodromy matrix. The equations for the eigenfunction are included in the
defining boundary-value problem, allowing a straightforward implementation in
AUTO, in which only the standard features of the software are employed.
Homotopy methods to find connecting orbits are discussed in general and
illustrated with several examples, including the Lorenz equations. Complete
AUTO demos, which can be easily adapted to any autonomous 3-dimensional ODE
system, are freely available.
"
What is the method used to model a two-slit diffraction experiment with massive particles?,"  Matter-wave interferometry has been largely studied in the last few years.
Usually, the main problem in the analysis of the diffraction experiments is to
establish the causes for the loss of coherence observed in the interference
pattern. In this work, we use different type of environmental couplings to
model a two slit diffraction experiment with massive particles. For each model,
we study the effects of decoherence on the interference pattern and define a
visibility function that measures the loss of contrast of the interference
fringes on a distant screen. Finally, we apply our results to the experimental
reported data on massive particles $C_{70}$.
"
"Can radial-velocity measurements, transit photometry, and occultation spectroscopy be used to study the atmospheres of M-dwarf planets?","  One of the great quests of astronomy is to obtain the spectrum of a
terrestrial planet orbiting within the habitable zone of its star, and the
dominant challenge in doing so is to isolate the light of the planet from that
of the star. Dynamics-based methods separate these signals temporally, whereas
imaging techniques do so spatially. In light of the overwhelming dominance of
dynamics-based methods over the past decade, we challenge the notion that
spectra of terrestrial planets necessarily require extreme imaging methods. We
advocate that some resources be committed to refining the proven technologies
of radial-velocity measurements, transit photometry, and occultation
spectroscopy (i.e. emergent infrared spectra obtained at secondary eclipse). We
see a particularly attractive opportunity in M-dwarfs, for which the habitable
zone is close to the star, increasing the probability and frequency of
transits, and the amplitude of the induced radial-velocity variation. Such
planets could be discovered by a dedicated ground-based transit survey of the
10,000 nearest M-dwarfs. The favorable planet-star contrast ratio would make
these planets ideal targets for the study of their atmospheres with the
technique of occultation spectroscopy.
"
What is the screened potential used to derive in astrophysical plasmas?,"  Screened potential, modified by non standard electron cloud distributions
responsible for the shielding effect on fusion of reacting nuclei in
astrophysical plasmas, is derived. The case of clouds with depleted tails in
space coordinates is discussed. The modified screened potential is obtained
both from statistical mechanics arguments based on fluctuations of the inverse
of the Debye-Huckel radius and from the solution of a Bernoulli equation used
in generalized statistical mechanics. Plots and tables useful in evaluating
penetration probability at any energy are provided.
"
What are the possible orbital periods of the neutron star in the X-ray binary system XTE J1829-098?,"  XMM-Newton and Chandra observations of the transient 7.8 s pulsar XTE
J1829-098 are used to characterize its pulse shape and spectrum, and to
facilitate a search for an optical or infrared counterpart. In outburst, the
absorbed, hard X-ray spectrum with Gamma = 0.76+/-0.13 and N_H = (6.0+/-0.6) x
10^{22} cm^{-2} is typical of X-ray binary pulsars. The precise Chandra
localization in a faint state leads to the identification of a probable
infrared counterpart at R.A. = 18h29m43.98s, decl. = -09o51'23.0"" (J2000.0)
with magnitudes K=12.7, H=13.9, I>21.9, and R>23.2. If this is a highly
reddened O or B star, we estimate a distance of 10 kpc, at which the maximum
observed X-ray luminosity is 2x10^{36} ergs s^{-1}, typical of Be X-ray
transients or wind-fed systems. The minimum observed luminosity is
3x10^{32}(d/10 kpc)^2 ergs s^{-1}. We cannot rule out the possibility that the
companion is a red giant. The two known X-ray outbursts of XTE J1829-098 are
separated by ~1.3 yr, which may be the orbital period or a multiple of it, with
the neutron star in an eccentric orbit. We also studied a late M-giant
long-period variable that we found only 9"" from the X-ray position. It has a
pulsation period of ~1.5 yr, but is not the companion of the X-ray source.
"
What is the theoretical prediction for a small fractional difference in energy loss for $\mu^+$ and $\mu^-$ of the order of $0.15 %$ at high energies?,"  Theoretical calculations predict a small fractional difference in energy loss
for $\mu^+$ and $\mu^-$ of the order of $0.15 %$ at high energies. This is
predominantly due to a $z^3$ term in an extended ionization $dE/dX$ relation,
in analogy to the Barkas effect at low energies around the Bethe-Bloch maximum.
The atmospheric muon energy spectrum is steeply falling off with approximately
$E^{-3.7}$ and thus the small difference in $dE/dX$ between $\mu^+$ and $\mu^-$
at high energies results in an amplified charge asymmetry of about $0.6 %$ many
thousand meters water equivalent deep underground.
"
What are the universal invariants of the braid-permutation groups represented by the semi-associators?,"  Drinfel'd used associators to construct families of universal representations
of braid groups. We consider semi-associators (i.e., we drop the pentagonal
axiom and impose a normalization in degree one). We show that the process may
be reversed, to obtain semi-associators from universal representations of
3-braids. We view braid groups as subgroups of braid-permutation groups. We
construct a family of universal representations of braid-permutation groups,
without using associators. All representations in the family are faithful,
defined over $\bbQ$ by simple explicit formulae. We show that they give
universal Vassiliev-type invariants for braid-permutation groups.
"
What is the relationship between Coxeter polytopes and a unique dotted edge?,"  We consider compact hyperbolic Coxeter polytopes whose Coxeter diagram
contains a unique dotted edge. We prove that such a polytope in d-dimensional
hyperbolic space has at most d+3 facets. In view of results of Lann\'er,
Kaplinskaja, Esselmann, and the second author, this implies that compact
hyperbolic Coxeter polytopes with a unique pair of non-intersecting facets are
completely classified. They do exist only up to dimension 6 and in dimension 8.
"
What is the relationship between the principality of a comodule algebra and the lattice of its kernels?,"  A comodule algebra P over a Hopf algebra H with bijective antipode is called
principal if the coaction of H is Galois and P is H-equivariantly projective
(faithfully flat) over the coaction-invariant subalgebra B. We prove that
principality is a piecewise property: given N comodule-algebra surjections
P->Pi whose kernels intersect to zero, P is principal if and only if all Pi's
are principal. Furthermore, assuming the principality of P, we show that the
lattice these kernels generate is distributive if and only if so is the lattice
obtained by intersection with B. Finally, assuming the above distributivity
property, we obtain a flabby sheaf of principal comodule algebras over a
certain space that is universal for all such N-families of surjections P->Pi
and such that the comodule algebra of global sections is P.
"
What is the formula for the gel point in the drop-wise addition polymerization?,"  A theory of drop-wise addition polymerization is developed. Because of the
linear growth of the reaction volume V, the system gives rise to a new type of
distribution function for cyclic species that can be expressed by the sum of
two terms: the conventional distribution term and a extra term due to the
dilution effect. The present result is an extension of the conventional
homogeneous polymerization that corresponds to a special case without the extra
term. Making use of the result we derive the gel point formula for this unique
polymerization. The theoretical result is compared with the recent
observations.
"
What are the implications of the subordination of the Brownian process to the Markov process?,"  A Brownian time process is a Markov process subordinated to the absolute
value of an independent one-dimensional Brownian motion. Its transition
densities solve an initial value problem involving the square of the generator
of the original Markov process. An apparently unrelated class of processes,
emerging as the scaling limits of continuous time random walks, involve
subordination to the inverse or hitting time process of a classical stable
subordinator. The resulting densities solve fractional Cauchy problems, an
extension that involves fractional derivatives in time. In this paper, we will
show a close and unexpected connection between these two classes of processes,
and consequently, an equivalence between these two families of partial
differential equations.
"
What are the implications of the gapless spinons in the Kagome spin liquid insulator?,"  The charge dynamics of spin-liquid states described by U(1) gauge theory
coupling to fermionic spinons is discussed in this paper. We find that the
gapless spinons give rise to a power law optical conductivity inside the charge
gap. The theory is applied to explain the unusual optical conductivity observed
recently in the organic compound $\kappa-(BEDT-TTF)_2Cu_2(CN)_3$. We also
propose an optical experiment to search for the in-gap excitations in the
Kagome spin liquid insulator.
"
How can the negative-tension brane be used to shield the bulk spacetime from a singularity?,"  Braneworlds, understood here as double domain wall spacetimes, can be
described in terms of a linear harmonic function, with kinks at the locations
of the boundary branes. In a dynamical setting, there is therefore the risk
that the boundary brane of negative tension, at whose location the value of the
harmonic function is always lowest, can encounter a zero of this harmonic
function, corresponding to the formation of a singularity. We show that for
certain types of brane-bound matter this singularity can be avoided, and the
negative-tension brane can shield the bulk spacetime from the singularity by
bouncing back smoothly before reaching the singularity. In our analysis we
compare the 5- and 4-dimensional descriptions of this phenomenon in order to
determine the validity of the moduli space approximation.
"
What are the Homfly polynomials of genus 2 mutant knots?,"  Pairs of genus 2 mutant knots can have different Homfly polynomials, for
example some 3-string satellites of Conway mutant pairs. We give examples which
have different Kauffman 3-variable polynomials, answering a question raised by
Dunfield et al in their study of genus 2 mutants. While pairs of genus 2 mutant
knots have the same Jones polynomial, given from the Homfly polynomial by
setting v=s^2, we give examples whose Homfly polynomials differ when v=s^3. We
also give examples which differ in a Vassiliev invariant of degree 7, in
contrast to satellites of Conway mutant knots.
"
What is the Askey-Wilson algebraic symmetry of the boundary problem?,"  In the matrix product states approach to $n$ species diffusion processes the
stationary probability distribution is expressed as a matrix product state with
respect to a quadratic algebra determined by the dynamics of the process. The
quadratic algebra defines a noncommutative space with a $SU_q(n)$ quantum group
action as its symmetry. Boundary processes amount to the appearance of
parameter dependent linear terms in the algebraic relations and lead to a
reduction of the $SU_q(n)$ symmetry. We argue that the boundary operators of
the asymmetric simple exclusion process generate a tridiagonal algebra whose
irriducible representations are expressed in terms of the Askey-Wilson
polynomials. The Askey-Wilson algebra arises as a symmetry of the boundary
problem and allows to solve the model exactly.
"
What are the implications of the neutrino magnetic moment near current experimental limits for Majorana neutrinos?,"  The existence of a neutrino magnetic moment implies contributions to the
neutrino mass via radiative corrections. We derive model-independent
""naturalness"" upper bounds on the magnetic moments of Dirac and Majorana
neutrinos, generated by physics above the electroweak scale. For Dirac
neutrinos, the bound is several orders of magnitude more stringent than present
experimental limits. However, for Majorana neutrinos the magnetic moment bounds
are weaker than present experimental limits if $\mu_\nu$ is generated by new
physics at ~ 1 TeV, and surpass current experimental sensitivity only for new
physics scales > 10 -- 100 TeV. The discovery of a neutrino magnetic moment
near present limits would thus signify that neutrinos are Majorana particles.
"
What are the key results of the field theory analysis in the WZNW models?,"  Extending our earlier work on PSL(2|2), we explain how to reduce the solution
of WZNW models on general type I supergroups to those defined on the bosonic
subgroup. The new analysis covers in particular the supergroups GL(M|N) along
with several close relatives such as PSL(N|N), certain Poincare supergroups and
the series OSP(2|2N). This remarkable progress relies on the use of a special
Feigin-Fuchs type representation. In preparation for the field theory analysis,
we shall exploit a minisuperspace analogue of a free fermion construction to
deduce the spectrum of the Laplacian on type I supergroups. The latter is shown
to be non-diagonalizable. After lifting these results to the full WZNW model,
we address various issues of the field theory, including its modular invariance
and the computation of correlation functions. In agreement with previous
findings, supergroup WZNW models allow to study chiral and non-chiral aspects
of logarithmic conformal field theory within a geometric framework. We shall
briefly indicate how insights from WZNW models carry over to non-geometric
examples, such as e.g. the W(p) triplet models.
"
What is the traditional representation of pathways in systems biology?,"  Pathways are integral to systems biology. Their classical representation has
proven useful but is inconsistent in the meaning assigned to each arrow (or
edge) and inadvertently implies the isolation of one pathway from another.
Conversely, modern high-throughput experiments give rise to standardized
networks facilitating topological calculations. Combining these perspectives,
we can embed classical pathways within large-scale networks and thus
demonstrate the crosstalk between them. As more diverse types of
high-throughput data become available, we can effectively merge both
perspectives, embedding pathways simultaneously in multiple networks. However,
the original problem still remains - the current edge representation is
inadequate to accurately convey all the information in pathways. Therefore, we
suggest that a standardized, well-defined, edge ontology is necessary and
propose a prototype here, as a starting point for reaching this goal.
"
What is the effect of the imposed wind on the freezing of fronts in a cellular flow?,"  We present experiments on the behavior of reaction fronts in ordered and
disordered cellular flows with imposed winds. Fronts in a chain of alternating
vortices are found to freeze (pin to the separatrix) for a wide range of
imposed winds that grows nonlinearly with the characteristic strength of the
underlying vorticity. Experiments in spatially-disordered flows demonstrate
that freezing of fronts is common to cellular flows; furthermore, it is not
dependent on boundary conditions. We therefore anticipate similar pinning in a
wide range of cellular flows and front-producing systems.
"
What is the wavelength of the step density wave independent of the surface orientation?,"  This paper investigates faceting mechanisms induced by electromigration in
the regime where atomic steps are transparent. For this purpose we study
several vicinal orientations by means of in-situ (optical diffraction,
electronic microscopy) as well as ex-situ (AFM, microprofilometry)
visualization techniques. The data show that faceting proceeds in two stages.
The first stage is short and leads to the appearance of a step density wave,
with a wavelength roughly independent of the surface orientation. The second
stage is much slower, and leads to the formation of a hill-and-valley
structure, the period of which depends on the initial surface orientation. A
simple continuum model enables us to point out why the wavelength of the step
density wave does not depend on the microscale details of the surface. The
final wavelength is controlled by the competition between elastic step-step
interaction and facet edge energy cost. Finally, the surface stress angular
dependence is shown to emerge as a coarsed-grained picture from the step model.
"
What is the relationship between the size of the lattice and the spin boundary condition?,"  We study the spectrum of the even parity excitations of the nucleon in
quenched lattice QCD. We extend our earlier analysis by including an expanded
basis of nucleon interpolating fields, increasing the physical size of the
lattice, including more configurations to enhance statistics and probing closer
to the chiral limit. With a review of world lattice data, we conclude that
there is little evidence of the Roper resonance in quenched lattice QCD.
"
What is the parton system created in relativistic heavy-ion collisions?,"  The idea that the parton system created in relativistic heavy-ion collisions
(i) emerges in a state with transverse momenta close to thermodynamic
equilibrium and (ii) its evolution at early times is dominated by the
2-dimensional (transverse) hydrodynamics of the ideal fluid is investigated. It
is argued that this mechanism may help to solve the problem of early
equilibration.
"
What is the new model of AGN heating that takes into account the cosmic-ray heating in the intracluster medium?,"  Recent observations show that the cooling flows in the central regions of
galaxy clusters are highly suppressed. Observed AGN-induced cavities/bubbles
are a leading candidate for suppressing cooling, usually via some form of
mechanical heating. At the same time, observed X-ray cavities and synchrotron
emission point toward a significant non-thermal particle population. Previous
studies have focused on the dynamical effects of cosmic-ray pressure support,
but none have built successful models in which cosmic-ray heating is
significant. Here we investigate a new model of AGN heating, in which the
intracluster medium is efficiently heated by cosmic-rays, which are injected
into the ICM through diffusion or the shredding of the bubbles by
Rayleigh-Taylor or Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities. We include thermal
conduction as well. Using numerical simulations, we show that the cooling
catastrophe is efficiently suppressed. The cluster quickly relaxes to a
quasi-equilibrium state with a highly reduced accretion rate and temperature
and density profiles which match observations. Unlike the conduction-only case,
no fine-tuning of the Spitzer conduction suppression factor f is needed. The
cosmic ray pressure, P_c/P_g <~ 0.1 and dP_c/dr <~ 0.1 \rho g, is well within
observational bounds. Cosmic ray heating is a very attractive alternative to
mechanical heating, and may become particularly compelling if GLAST detects the
gamma-ray signature of cosmic-rays in clusters.
"
What are the broadening features observed on the blue wing of the doublet?,"  We have measured the reduced absorption coefficients occurring in the wings
of the potassium 4S-5P doublet lines at 404.414 nm and at 404.720 nm broadened
by helium gas at pressures of several hundred Torr. At the experimental
temperature of 900 K, we have detected a shoulder-like broadening feature on
the blue wing of the doublet which is relatively flat between 401.8 nm and
402.8 nm and which drops off rapidly for shorter wavelengths, corresponding to
absorption from the X doublet Sigma+ state to the C doublet Sigma+ state of the
K-He quasimolecule. The accurate measurements of the line profiles in the
present work will sharply constrain future calculations of potential energy
surfaces and transition dipole moments correlating to the asymptotes He-K(5p),
He-K(5s), and He-K(3d).
"
What are the phenomena associated with zero-point fluctuations in magneto-electric media?,"  In this work we apply field regularization techniques to formulate a number
of new phenomena related to momentum induced by electromagnetic zero-point
fluctuations. We discuss the zero-point momentum associated with
magneto-electric media, with moving media, and with magneto-chiral media.
"
What are the results of the numerical calculations for the non-dissipative current in a quantum dot system?,"  We report the implementation of the self-consistent Thomas-Fermi screening
theory, together with the local Ohm's law to a quantum dot system in order to
obtain local current distribution within the dot and at the leads. We consider
a large dot (size
  $>700$ nm) defined by split gates, and coupled to the leads. Numerical
calculations show that the non-dissipative current is confined to the
incompressible strips. Due to the non-linear screening properties of the 2DES
at low temperatures, this distribution is highly sensitive to external magnetic
field. Our findings support the phenomenological models provided by the
experimental studies so far, where the formation of the (direct) edge channels
dominate the transport.
"
What is the melting temperature of the crystal in the Lennard-Jones model?,"  We report observation of crystallization of the glass-forming binary
Lennard-Jones liquid first used by Wahnstr\""om [G. Wahnstr\""om, Phys. Rev. A
44, 3752 (1991)]. Molecular dynamics simulations of the metastable liquid on a
timescale of microseconds were performed. The liquid crystallized
spontaneously. The crystal structure was identified as MgZn_2. Formation of
transient crystallites is observed in the liquid. The crystallization is
investigate at different temperatures and compositions. At high temperature the
rate of crystallite formation is the limiting factor, while at low temperature
the limiting factor is growth rate. The melting temperature of the crystal is
estimated to be T_m=0.93 at rho=0.82. The maximum crystallization rate of the
A_2B composition is T=0.60+/-0.02.
"
What is the condition for the existence of Shalika period for a cuspidal automorphic representation of GL_4 with central character \mu^2?,"  Let \pi be a cuspidal automorphic representation of GL_4 with central
character \mu^2. It is known that \pi has Shalika period with respect to \mu if
and only if the L-function L^S(s, \pi, \bigwedge^2\otimes\mu^{-1}) has a pole
at s=1. Recentlt, Jacquet and Martin considered the analogous question for
cuspidal representations \pi_D of the inner form GL_2(D)(\A), and obtained a
partial result via the relative trace formula. In this paper, we provide a
complete solution to this problem via the method of theta correspondence, and
give necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of Shalika period
for \pi_D. We also resolve the analogous question in the local setting.
"
How are the non-resonant meson-baryon interactions of the model derived from a set of Lagrangians using a unitary transformation method?,"  As a first step to analyze the electromagnetic meson production reactions in
the nucleon resonance region, the parameters of the hadronic interactions of a
dynamical coupled-channel model, developed in {\it Physics Reports 439, 193
(2007)}, are determined by fitting the $\pi N$ scattering data. The channels
included in the calculations are $\pi N$, $\eta N$ and $\pi\pi N$ which has
$\pi\Delta$, $\rho N$, and $\sigma N$ resonant components. The non-resonant
meson-baryon interactions of the model are derived from a set of Lagrangians by
using a unitary transformation method. One or two bare excited nucleon states
in each of $S$, $P$, $D$, and $F$ partial waves are included to generate the
resonant amplitudes in the fits. The parameters of the model are first
determined by fitting as much as possible the empirical $\pi N$ elastic
scattering amplitudes of SAID up to 2 GeV. We then refine and confirm the
resulting parameters by directly comparing the predicted differential cross
section and target polarization asymmetry with the original data of the elastic
$\pi^{\pm} p \to \pi^{\pm} p$ and charge-exchange $\pi^- p \to \pi^0 n$
processes. The predicted total cross sections of $\pi N$ reactions and $\pi
N\to \eta N$ reactions are also in good agreement with the data. Applications
of the constructed model in analyzing the electromagnetic meson production data
as well as the future developments are discussed.
"
What is the Ginzburg-Landau model used to analyze the behavior of a superconducting wire exposed to an electric current?,"  We examine the behavior of a one-dimensional superconducting wire exposed to
an applied electric current. We use the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau model to
describe the system and retain temperature and applied current as parameters.
Through a combination of spectral analysis, asymptotics and canonical numerical
computation, we divide this two-dimensional parameter space into a number of
regions. In some of them only the normal state or a stationary state or an
oscillatory state are stable, while in some of them two states are stable. One
of the most interesting features of the analysis is the evident collision of
real eigenvalues of the associated PT-symmetric linearization, leading as it
does to the emergence of complex elements of the spectrum. In particular this
provides an explanation to the emergence of a stable oscillatory state. We show
that part of the bifurcation diagram and many of the emerging patterns are
directly controlled by this spectrum, while other patterns arise due to
nonlinear interaction of the leading eigenfunctions.
"
What is the average stellar mass fraction of the halo in the sample of 22 early-type galaxies?,"  We jointly model 22 early-type gravitational lens galaxies with stellar
dynamical measurements using standard CDM halo models. The sample is
inhomogeneous in both its mass distributions and the evolution of its stellar
populations unless the true uncertainties are significantly larger than the
reported measurement errors. In general, the individual systems cannot
constrain halo models, in the sense that the data poorly constrains the stellar
mass fraction of the halo. The ensemble of systems, however, strongly
constrains the average stellar mass represented by the visible galaxies to
$0.026\pm0.006$ of the halo mass if we neglect adiabatic compression, rising to
$0.056\pm0.011$ of the halo mass if we include adiabatic compression. Both
estimates are significantly smaller than the global baryon fraction,
corresponding to a star formation efficiency for early-type galaxies of
$10%-30%$. In the adiabatically compressed models, we find an average local
B-band stellar mass-to-light ratio of $(M/L)_0 =
(7.2\pm0.5)(M_{\sun}/L_{\sun})$ that evolves by $d\log(M/L)/dz = -0.72\pm0.08$
per unit redshift. Adjusting the isotropy of the stellar orbits has little
effect on the results. The adiabatically compressed models are strongly favored
if we impose either local estimates of the mass-to-light ratios of early-type
galaxies or the weak lensing measurements for the lens galaxies on 100 kpc
scales as model constraints.
"
What are the key concepts in a semantic network substrate for computing?,"  Using methods from coarse topology we show that fundamental classes of closed
enlargeable manifolds map non-trivially both to the rational homology of their
fundamental groups and to the K-theory of the corresponding reduced
C*-algebras. Our proofs do not depend on the Baum--Connes conjecture and
provide independent confirmation for specific predictions derived from this
conjecture.

What are the results of a graph and social network analysis of the Internet?,"  The proposal is to use clusters, graphs and networks as models in order to
analyse the Web structure. Clusters, graphs and networks provide knowledge
representation and organization. Clusters were generated by co-site analysis.
The sample is a set of academic Web sites from the countries belonging to the
European Union. These clusters are here revisited from the point of view of
graph theory and social network analysis. This is a quantitative and structural
analysis. In fact, the Internet is a computer network that connects people and
organizations. Thus we may consider it to be a social network. The set of Web
academic sites represents an empirical social network, and is viewed as a
virtual community. The network structural properties are here analysed applying
together cluster analysis, graph theory and social network analysis.
"
What is the total amount of diffuse light in the plume extending 110 kpc from the BCG in one IRAC image?,"  We have identified perhaps the largest major galaxy merger ever seen. While
analysing Spitzer IRAC images of CL0958+4702, an X-ray selected cluster at
z=0.39, we discovered an unusual plume of stars extending $\gtrsim$110 kpc
outward from the bright central galaxy (BCG). Three galaxies 1-1.5 mag fainter
than the BCG lie within 17 kpc (projected) of the BCG and are probably
participating in the merger. The plume is detected in all four IRAC channels
and at optical wavelengths in images from the WIYN telescope; the surface
brightness is remarkably high ($\mu_r\approx$24.8 mag arcsec$^{-2}$ at 50 kpc).
The optical and infrared colors are consistent with those of other BCGs,
suggesting that the plume is composed of old stars and negligible recent star
formation (hence a ""dry merger""). The luminosity in the plume is at least
equivalent to a 4L^* galaxy. A diffuse halo extending 110 kpc from the BCG in
one IRAC image suggests the total amount of diffuse light is L_r\sim
1.3x10^{11}h^{-2} L_sun. A Chandra observation shows an X-ray image and
spectrum typical of moderate-mass clusters. We use MMT/Hectospec to measure 905
redshifts in a 1 deg^2 region around the cluster. The velocities of two of the
BCG companions indicate a merger timescale for the companion galaxies of
$\sim$110 Myr and $\sim$0.5-1 Gyr for the plume. We conclude that the BCG and
intracluster light of CL0958 is formed by major mergers at moderate redshifts.
After the major merger is complete, CL0958 will likely become a fossil cluster.
"
What is the rational nilpotent adjoint of a split classical group in a local non-Archimedean field?,"  We relate the partition-type parametrization of rational (arithmetic)
nilpotent adjoint orbits of the split classical groups $SL_n$ and $Sp_{2n}$
over local non-Archimedean fields with a parametrization, introduced by
DeBacker in 2002, which uses the associated Bruhat-Tits building to relate the
question to one over the residue field.
"
What is the entropy penalized Mather problem?,"  We present a large deviation principle for the entropy penalized Mather
problem when the Lagrangian L is generic (in this case the Mather measure $\mu$
is unique and the support of $\mu$ is the Aubry set). Consider, for each value
of $\epsilon $ and h, the entropy penalized Mather problem $\min
\{\int_{\tn\times\rn}
  L(x,v)d\mu(x,v)+\epsilon S[\mu]\},$ where the entropy S is given by
$S[\mu]=\int_{\tn\times\rn}\mu(x,v)\ln\frac{\mu(x,v)}{\int_{\rn}\mu(x,w)dw}dxdv,$
and the minimization is performed over the space of probability densities
$\mu(x,v)$ that satisfy the holonomy constraint It follows from D. Gomes and E.
Valdinoci that there exists a minimizing measure $\mu_{\epsilon, h}$ which
converges to the Mather measure $\mu$. We show a LDP $\lim_{\epsilon,h\to0}
\epsilon \ln \mu_{\epsilon,h}(A),$ where $A\subset
\mathbb{T}^N\times\mathbb{R}^N$. The deviation function I is given by $I(x,v)=
L(x,v)+\nabla\phi_0(x)(v)-\bar{H}_{0},$ where $\phi_0$ is the unique viscosity
solution for L.
"
What is the expression of the interquark potential in a gauge theory with a non-constant non-commutativity?,"  The Wilson loop in the non-commutative dipole field theory is re-examined
within the framework of dual gravity description. In contrast to the previous
investigations, we let the dual string be moving along the deformed $S^5$ and
find the exact expression of the interquark potential. The potential shows a
Coulomb behavior at all distance and does not have a minimum distance between
quarks, which exhibits in the static configuration. After comparing the
potential of the static and moving configurations we find that while the dual
string is static at long distance it will transit to a moving configuration at
short distance. We also analyze an electric dipole system and find that it
shows a similar transition property. Finally, we mention the unsuitable
approximation made in the previous paper [hep-th/0701069] and find that the
interquark potential in a gauge theory with a non-constant non-commutativity
has a Coulomb behavior at all distance.
"
What are the orbital evolution timescales due to dissipative tides in eccentric binaries?,"  We investigate the secular evolution of the orbital semi-major axis and
eccentricity due to mass transfer in eccentric binaries, assuming conservation
of total system mass and orbital angular momentum. Assuming a delta function
mass transfer rate centered at periastron, we find rates of secular change of
the orbital semi-major axis and eccentricity which are linearly proportional to
the magnitude of the mass transfer rate at periastron. The rates can be
positive as well as negative, so that the semi-major axis and eccentricity can
increase as well as decrease in time. Adopting a delta-function mass-transfer
rate of $10^{-9} M_\sun {\rm yr}^{-1}$ at periastron yields orbital evolution
timescales ranging from a few Myr to a Hubble time or more, depending on the
binary mass ratio and orbital eccentricity. Comparison with orbital evolution
timescales due to dissipative tides furthermore shows that tides cannot, in all
cases, circularize the orbit rapidly enough to justify the often adopted
assumption of instantaneous circularization at the onset of mass transfer. The
formalism presented can be incorporated in binary evolution and population
synthesis codes to create a self-consistent treatment of mass transfer in
eccentric binaries.
"
What are the results of the improved theoretical analysis of the total cross section sigma(e^+e^- --> hadrons) in the charm and bottom threshold region?,"  New data for the total cross section sigma(e^+e^- --> hadrons) in the charm
and bottom threshold region are combined with an improved theoretical analysis,
which includes recent four-loop calculations, to determine the short distance
\bar{MS} charm and bottom quark masses. The final result for the
\bar{MS}-masses, m_c(3 GeV)=0.986(13) GeV and m_b(10 GeV)=3.609(25) GeV is
consistent with but significantly more precise than a similar previous study.
"
What is the Monte Carlo optimization scheme used to reduce congestion in gradient networks?,"  Gradient networks can be used to model the dominant structure of complex
networks. Previous works have focused on random gradient networks. Here we
study gradient networks that minimize jamming on substrate networks with
scale-free and Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi structure. We introduce structural
correlations and strongly reduce congestion occurring on the network by using a
Monte Carlo optimization scheme. This optimization alters the degree
distribution and other structural properties of the resulting gradient
networks. These results are expected to be relevant for transport and other
dynamical processes in real network systems.
"
What is the relationship between the quantum potential and the quantum force?,"  Most experts reject the quantum potential introduced by David Bohm in 1952.
But it is impossible to describe some quantum mesoscopic phenomena observed in
superconductor nanostructures without a quantum force.
"
What are the two distinct spin wave modes observed in a ferromagnet with finite size?,"  Shot noise cross-correlations in normal metal-superconductor-normal metal
structures are discussed at arbitrary interface transparencies using both the
scattering approach of Blonder, Tinkham and Klapwik and a microscopic Green's
function approach. Surprisingly, negative crossed conductance in such set-ups
[R. Melin and D. Feinberg, Phys. Rev. B 70, 174509 (2004)] does not preclude
the possibility of positive noise cross-correlations for almost transparent
contacts. We conclude with a phenomenological discussion of interactions in the
one dimensional leads connected to the superconductor, which induce sign
changes in the noise cross-correlations.
"
What is the definition of a singular point in the context of a 2-manifold?,"  Let $M^2$ be an oriented 2-manifold and $f:M^2\to R^3$ a $C^\infty$-map. A
point $p\in M^2$ is called a singular point if $f$ is not an immersion at $p$.
The map $f$ is called a front (or wave front), if there exists a unit
$C^\infty$-vector field $\nu$ such that the image of each tangent vector
$df(X)$ $(X\in TM^2)$ is perpendicular to $\nu$, and the pair $(f,\nu)$ gives
an immersion into $R^3\times S^2$. In our previous paper, we gave an intrinsic
formulation of wave fronts in $R^3$. In this paper, we shall investigate the
behavior of cuspidal edges near corank one singular points and establish
Gauss-Bonnet-type formulas under the intrinsic formulation.
"
What is the operational definition of space-time in four dimensions based on quantum mechanics and general relativity?,"  First we contemplate the operational definition of space-time in four
dimensions in light of basic principles of quantum mechanics and general
relativity and consider some of its phenomenological consequences. The quantum
gravitational fluctuations of the background metric that comes through the
operational definition of space-time are controlled by the Planck scale and are
therefore strongly suppressed. Then we extend our analysis to the braneworld
setup with low fundamental scale of gravity. It is observed that in this case
the quantum gravitational fluctuations on the brane may become unacceptably
large. The magnification of fluctuations is not linked directly to the low
quantum gravity scale but rather to the higher-dimensional modification of
Newton's inverse square law at relatively large distances. For models with
compact extra dimensions the shape modulus of extra space can be used as a most
natural and safe stabilization mechanism against these fluctuations.
"
"What are the three concepts of massive star formation: monolithic collapse, competitive accretion, and stellar collisions and mergers?","  Although fundamental for astrophysics, the processes that produce massive
stars are not well understood. Large distances, high extinction, and short
timescales of critical evolutionary phases make observations of these processes
challenging. Lacking good observational guidance, theoretical models have
remained controversial. This review offers a basic description of the collapse
of a massive molecular core and a critical discussion of the three competing
concepts of massive star formation:
  - monolithic collapse in isolated cores
  - competitive accretion in a protocluster environment
  - stellar collisions and mergers in very dense systems
  We also review the observed outflows, multiplicity, and clustering properties
of massive stars, the upper initial mass function and the upper mass limit. We
conclude that high-mass star formation is not merely a scaled-up version of
low-mass star formation with higher accretion rates, but partly a mechanism of
its own, primarily owing to the role of stellar mass and radiation pressure in
controlling the dynamics.
"
What is the quantum communication complexity in the non-interactive one-way and simultaneous message passing settings?,"  We give the first exponential separation between quantum and classical
multi-party communication complexity in the (non-interactive) one-way and
simultaneous message passing settings.
  For every k, we demonstrate a relational communication problem between k
parties that can be solved exactly by a quantum simultaneous message passing
protocol of cost O(log n) and requires protocols of cost n^{c/k^2}, where c>0
is a constant, in the classical non-interactive one-way message passing model
with shared randomness and bounded error.
  Thus our separation of corresponding communication classes is superpolynomial
as long as k=o(\sqrt{\log n / \log\log n}) and exponential for k=O(1).
"
What are the dynamics of nanoscale droplets in the vicinity of chemical steps in the substrate?,"  We investigate the dynamics of nanoscale droplets in the vicinity of chemical
steps which separate parts of a substrate with different wettabilities. Due to
long-ranged dispersion forces, nanodroplets positioned on one side of the step
perceive the different character of the other side even at some distances from
the step, leading to a dynamic response. The direction of the ensuing motion of
such droplets does not only depend on the difference between the equilibrium
contact angles on these two parts but in particular on the difference between
the corresponding Hamaker constants. Therefore the motion is not necessarily
directed towards the more wettable side and can also be different from that of
droplets which span the step.
"
What is the body effect of bandgap renormalization in a quasi one dimensional system?,"  In this paper, bound states energies and corresponding wave functions of
H-shaped quantum wires are calculated numerically in the presence of external
magnetic and electric fields and within the Landau gauge. With a suitable
definition of external confinement potential, we present a numerical algorithm
to calculate the profile of probability distribution of charge carriers. Our
analysis shows that in the presence of external electric and magnetic fields,
bound state properties of carriers are sensitive functions of an asymmetric
parameter $a=\frac{W_{x}}{W_{y}}$ which measures the relative width of the well
in two directions. We also study many body effect of bandgap renormalization in
this quasi one dimensional system within dynamical random phase approximation.
"
How do we characterize the Cohen-Macaulayness of multi-Rees algebras?,"  Let S be a standard N^r-graded algebra over a local ring A, and let M be a
finitely generated Z^r-graded S-module. We characterize the Cohen-Macaulayness
of M in terms of the vanishing of certain sheaf cohomology modules. As a
consequence, we apply our result to study the Cohen-Macaulayness of multi-Rees
modules (also called Rees modification). Our work extends previous studies on
the Cohen-Macaulayness of multi-Rees algebras.
"
What are the implications of the introduction of a gravitino mass term on a regularized brane?,"  We consider the gravitino spectrum for the general warped solution in a
specific six-dimensional gauged supergravity. We find that although the brane
tensions introduced at the conical singularities break the bulk supersymmetry
explicitly, massless modes of gravitino can exist with a nontrivial wave
function profile, due to a nonzero U(1)_R gauge flux. We also compute the wave
function and the mass spectrum of Kaluza-Klein massive modes of the gravitino
explicitly. We show that the introduction of a gravitino mass term on a
regularized brane can give a suppressed effective gravitino mass compared to
the compactification scale, due to the delocalization of the wave function of
the zero-mode gravitino.
"
How does the stellar population and age distribution vary radially in the Leo II galaxy?,"  We carried out a wide-field V, I imaging survey of the Local Group dwarf
spheroidal galaxy Leo II using the Subaru Prime Focus Camera on the 8.2-m
Subaru Telescope. The survey covered an area of 26.67 x 26.67 arcmin^2, far
beyond the tidal radius of Leo II (8.63 arcmin), down to the limiting magnitude
of V ~26, which is roughly 1 mag deeper than the turn-off point of the main
sequence stars of Leo II. Radial number density profiles of bright and faint
red giant branch (RGB) stars were found to change their slopes at around the
tidal radius, and extend beyond the tidal radius with shallower slopes. A
smoothed surface brightness map of Leo II suggests the existence of a small
substructure of globular cluster luminosity beyond the tidal radius. We
investigated the properties of the stellar population by means of the
color-magnitude diagram. The horizontal branch (HB) morphology index shows a
radial gradient in which red HB stars are more concentrated than blue HB stars,
which is common to many Local Group dwarf spheroidal galaxies. The color
distribution of RGB stars around the mean RGB sequence shows a larger
dispersion at the center than in the outskirts, indicating a mixture of stellar
populations at the center and a more homogeneous population in the outskirts.
Based on the age estimation using subgiant branch (SGB) stars, we found that
although the major star formation took place ~8 Gyr ago, a considerable stellar
population younger than 8 Gyr is found at the center; such a younger population
is insignificant in the outskirts.
"
What is the relationship between Coulomb blockade and Coulomb blockade in graphene nanoribbons?,"  We propose that recent transport experiments revealing the existence of an
energy gap in graphene nanoribbons may be understood in terms of Coulomb
blockade. Electron interactions play a decisive role at the quantum dots which
form due to the presence of necks arising from the roughness of the graphene
edge. With the average transmission as the only fitting parameter, our theory
shows good agreement with the experimental data.
"
What are the implications of the quantum anomaly in the regulating extra dimension?,"  We present an explicit calculation of the one-loop quantum corrections to the
mass and the two central charges of the kink solution of an N=(2,2)
supersymmetric CP^1 model with twisted mass, using supersymmetry preserving
dimensional regularization adapted to solitons. We find that the quantum
corrections of the mass and one of the central charges are nontrivial (but
saturate the BPS bound), while the other central charge receives no
corrections. The nontrivial central charge correction corresponds to a quantum
anomaly, which in our scheme appears as parity violation in the regulating
extra dimension, and its magnitude is in agreement with exact results obtained
by Dorey on the basis of a massive analog of mirror symmetry from a dual U(1)
gauge theory, confirming also the recent work by Shifman, Vainshtein, and
Zwicky.
"
What is the used value of f_col in the kerrbb model?,"  We have analysed four ASCA observations (1994--1995, 1996--1997) and three
XMM-Newton observations (2005) of this source, in all of which the source is in
high/soft state. We modeled the continuum spectra with relativistic disk model
kerrbb, estimated the spin of the central black hole, and constrained the
spectral hardening factor f_col and the distance. If kerrbb model applies, for
normally used value of f_col, the distance cannot be very small, and f_col
changes with observations.
"
What are the key techniques and devices evaluated and developed so far for the vibration diagnostics of the machine?,"  The future e-e+ 500 GeV International Linear Collider will rely on
unprecedented nanometer scale particle beam size at the interaction point, in
order to achieve the design luminosity. Tight tolerances on static and dynamic
alignment of the accelerator cavities and optical components are demanded to
transport and focus the high energy electron and positron beams with reasonable
position jitter and low emittance. A brief review of techniques and devices
evaluated and developed so far for the vibration diagnostics of the machine is
presented in this paper.
"
What are the characteristics of the waves in the stagnant motion in a system of a point mass with a disk?,"  We study gravitational waves from a particle moving around a system of a
point mass with a disk in Newtonian gravitational theory. A particle motion in
this system can be chaotic when the gravitational contribution from a surface
density of a disk is comparable with that from a point mass. In such an orbit,
we sometimes find that there appears a phase of the orbit in which particle
motion becomes to be nearly regular (the so-called ``stagnant motion'') for a
finite time interval between more strongly chaotic phases. To study how these
different chaotic behaviours affect on observation of gravitational waves, we
investigate a correlation of the particle motion and the waves. We find that
such a difference in chaotic motions reflects on the wave forms and energy
spectra. The character of the waves in the stagnant motion is quite different
from that either in a regular motion or in a more strongly chaotic motion. This
suggests that we may make a distinction between different chaotic behaviours of
the orbit via the gravitational waves.
"
What is the anomalous dimension for the dual spikes in the flat case?,"  We find a new class of spiky solutions for closed strings in flat,
$AdS_3\subset AdS_5$ and $R\times S^2(\subset S^5)$ backgrounds. In the flat
case the new solutions turn out to be T-dual configurations of spiky strings
found by Kruczenski hep-th/0410226. In the case of solutions living in $AdS$,
we make a semi classical analysis by taking the large angular momentum limit.
The anomalous dimension for these dual spikes is similar to that for rotating
and pulsating circular strings in AdS with angular momentum playing the role of
the level number. This replaces the well known logarithmic dependence for
spinning strings. For the dual spikes living on sphere we find that no large
angular momentum limit exists.
"
What are the extensions of the algorithm for estimating unknown system parameters?,"  Data assimilation refers to the process of obtaining an estimate of a
system's state using a model for the system's time evolution and a time series
of measurements that are possibly noisy and incomplete. However, for practical
reasons, the high dimensionality of large spatiotemporally chaotic systems
prevents the use of classical data assimilation techniques. Here, via numerical
computations on the paradigmatic example of large aspect ratio Rayleigh-Benard
convection, we demonstrate the applicability of a recently developed data
assimilation method designed to circumvent this difficulty. In addition, we
describe extensions of the algorithm for estimating unknown system parameters.
Our results suggest the potential usefulness of our data assimilation technique
to a broad class of situations in which there is spatiotemporally chaotic
behavior.
"
What is the holographic description of the three-dimensional Kerr-de Sitter space?,"  The holographic description of the three-dimensional Kerr-de Sitter space
with a gravitational Chern-Simons term is studied, in the context of dS/CFT
correspondence. The space has only one (cosmological) event horizon and its
mass and angular momentum are identified from the holographic energy-momentum
tensor at the asymptotic infinity. The thermodynamic entropy of the
cosmological horizon is computed directly from the first law of thermodynamics,
with the usual Hawking temperature, and it is found that the usual
Gibbons-Hawking entropy is modified. It is remarked that, due to the
gravitational Chern-Simons term, (a) the results go beyond analytic
continuation from AdS, (b) the maximum-mass/N-bound conjecture may be violated,
and (c) the three-dimensional cosmology is chiral. A statistical mechanical
computation of the entropy, from a Cardy-like formula for a dual CFT at the
asymptotic boundary, is discussed. Some technical difference in the
Chern-Simons energy-momentum tensor, from literatures is remarked also.
"
What are the gauge invariances and their unity with diffeomorphism invariances in second order metric gravity?,"  A new analysis of the gauge invariances and their unity with diffeomorphism
invariances in second order metric gravity is presented which strictly follows
Dirac's constrained Hamiltonian approach.
"
What is the effect of nonzero momentum transfer on the width of the lightest pentaquark?,"  We have used the light-cone formulation of Chiral-Quark Soliton Model to
estimate the width of the lightest pentaquark Theta+. We have found that the
effect of nonzero momentum transfer is important and reduces drastically the
width to about 0.43 MeV. This means that this effect is a piece of the small
width puzzle of exotic baryons.
"
What is the scaling flow that has no fixed point ($\beta>0$) for conductivities up to and beyond the symplectic metal-insulator transition?,"  We numerically calculate the conductivity $\sigma$ of an undoped graphene
sheet (size $L$) in the limit of vanishingly small lattice constant. We
demonstrate one-parameter scaling for random impurity scattering and determine
the scaling function $\beta(\sigma)=d\ln\sigma/d\ln L$. Contrary to a recent
prediction, the scaling flow has no fixed point ($\beta>0$) for conductivities
up to and beyond the symplectic metal-insulator transition. Instead, the data
supports an alternative scaling flow for which the conductivity at the Dirac
point increases logarithmically with sample size in the absence of intervalley
scattering -- without reaching a scale-invariant limit.
"
How does the large-scale streaming motion affect the Hubble expansion fits of Type Ia supernovae?,"  We study the expansion of the nearby Universe using a sample of Type Ia
supernovae at redshifts below 0.08. These supernovae allow peculiar velocities
to be measured at unprecedented precision. We have investigated in detail the
possibility of a varying Hubble constant with redshift and found no evidence of
a monopole term for the nearby Universe. A large scale streaming motion is
found at an amplitude of about $340^{63}_{-71}$ km/sec, aligned in the
direction of $(l_0, b_0) = (312^{\rm o}.0^{13.5}_{-7.4}, 25^{\rm
o}.7^{8.0}_{-9.2})$, which is close to the direction of the center of Shapley
supercluster of galaxies. The large scale streaming motion is best fit by a
function involving a strong bipolar term. The streaming velocity field extends
from the lowest redshift ($\sim 0.007$) to beyond 0.025 and likely out to even
higher redshifts. The velocity field at redshift below 0.01 can be equally well
described by a dipole field or by the same bipolar streaming velocity field
that reaches out to beyond $z \sim 0.025$. We are also able to deduce a robust
estimate of the random velocity component of the peculiar velocity field.
Within the volume of redshift below 0.01 (weighted average redshift of $\sim$
0.067), this thermal component is found to be about 270 km/sec. After
correcting this smooth streaming motion, we are able to significantly improve
the Hubble expansion fits of these supernovae. The CMAGIC method gives a
dramatic decrease of $\chi^2$ from 90 to 63 for 69 degrees of freedom, and
yields a residual scatter of only 0.12 magnitude; the maximum light method
gives also a moderate improvement.
"
What are the conditions under which ion beams can drive micro-instabilities in coronal holes?,"  Spectroscopic observations and theoretical models suggest resonant
wave-particle interactions, involving high-frequency ion-cyclotron waves, as
the principal mechanism for heating and accelerating ions in the open coronal
holes. However, the mechanism responsible for the generation of the
ion-cyclotron waves remains unclear. One possible scenario is that ion beams
originating from small-scale reconnection events can drive micro-instabilities
that constitute a possible source for the excitation of ion-cyclotron waves. In
order to study ion beam-driven electromagnetic instabilities, the multi-fluid
model in the low-beta coronal plasma is used. While neglecting the electron
inertia this model allows one to take into account ion-cyclotron wave effects
that are absent from the one-fluid MHD model. Realistic models of density and
temperature as well as a 2-D analytical magnetic field model are used to define
the background plasma in the open-field funnel region of a polar coronal hole.
Considering the WKB approximation, a Fourier plane-wave linear mode analysis is
employed in order to derive the dispersion relation. Ray-tracing theory is used
to compute the ray path of the unstable wave as well as the evolution of the
growth rate of the wave while propagating in the coronal funnel. We demonstrate
that, in typical coronal holes conditions and assuming realistic values of the
beam velocity, the free energy provided by the ion beam propagating parallel
the ambient field can drive micro-instabilities through resonant ion-cyclotron
excitation.
"
What is the significance of the admixture of the singlet SUSY breaking F-term in the 24-dimensional representation?,"  We consider neutralino dark matter within the framework of SUSY GUTs with
non-universal gaugino masses. In particular we focus on the case of SU(5) with
a SUSY breaking F-term in the 1, 24, 75 and 200 dimensional representations. We
discuss the 24 case in some detail, and show that the bulk dark matter region
cannot be accessed. We then go on to consider the admixture of the singlet SUSY
breaking F-term with one of the 24, 75 or 200 dimensional F-terms, and show
that in these cases it becomes possible to access the bulk regions
corresponding to low fine-tuned dark matter. Our results are presented in the
$(M_1,M_2)$ plane for fixed $M_3$ and so are useful for considering general GUT
models, as well as more general non-universal gaugino models.
"
What is the role of the LHC in testing minimal flavor violation?,"  This is a written version of a series of lectures aimed at graduate students
and postdoctoral fellows in particle theory/string theory/particle experiment
familiar with the basics of the Standard Model. We begin with an overview of
flavor physics and its implications for new physics. We emphasize the ""new
physics flavor puzzle"". Then, we give four specific examples of flavor
measurements and the lessons that have been (or can be) drawn from them: (i)
Charm physics: lessons for supersymmetry from the upper bound on $\Delta m_D$.
(ii) Bottom physics: model independent lessons on the KM mechanism and on new
physics in neutral B mixing from $S_{\psi K_S}$. (iii) Top physics and beyond:
testing minimal flavor violation at the LHC. (iv) Neutrino physics:
interpreting the data on neutrino masses and mixing within flavor models.
"
How do moderate or large negative values of A0 affect the relic density of the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP)?,"  Phenomenologically viable and interesting regions of parameter space in the
minimal super-gravity (mSUGRA) model with small $m_0$ and small $m_{1/2}$
consistent with the WMAP data on dark matter relic density and the bound on the
mass of the lightest Higgs scalar $ m_h>$ 114 GeV from LEP2 open up if the
rather adhoc assumption $A_0$=0, where $A_0$ is the common trilinear soft
breaking parameter, employed in most of the existing analyses is relaxed. Since
this region corresponds to relatively light squarks and gluinos which are
likely to be probed extensively in the very early stages of the LHC
experiments, the consequences of moderate or large negative values of $A_0$ are
examined in detail. We find that in this region several processes including
lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP) pair annihilation, LSP - lighter tau
slepton (${\tilde \tau}_1$) coannihilation and LSP - lighter top squark
(${\tilde t}_1$) coannihilation contribute to the observed dark matter relic
density. %\sout{The possibility that a relic density producing ${\tilde t}_1$
can be %observed at the current experiments at the Tevatron is wide open.} The
possibility that a ${\tilde t}_1$ that can participate in coannihilation with
the lightest neutralino to satisfy the WMAP bound on relic density and at the
same time be observed at the current experiments at the Tevatron is wide open.
At the LHC a large number of squark - gluino events lead to a very distinctive
semi-inclusive signature $\tau^\pm$+X$_\tau$ (anything without a tau lepton)
with a characteristic size much larger than $e^\pm$+X$_e$ or $\mu^\pm$+X$_\mu$
events.
"
What are the key parameters in the linear transition point to the unstable global mode?,"  We describe how a convectively unstable active field in an open flow
configuration becomes absolutely unstable due to local mixing. A representation
of the mixing region as those with locally enhanced effective diffusion allows
us to find the linear transition point to unstable global mode analytically. We
derive the critical exponent characterizing weakly nonlinear regimes beyond
instability and compare it with numerical simulations of a full two-dimensional
flow problem.
"
How can the fidelity of GHZ and W states be determined with a minimal effort?,"  The determination of the state fidelity and the detection of entanglement are
fundamental problems in quantum information experiments. We investigate how
these goals can be achieved with a minimal effort. We show that the fidelity of
GHZ and W states can be determined with an effort increasing only linearly with
the number of qubits. We also present simple and robust methods for other
states, such as cluster states and states in decoherence-free subspaces.
"
What is the CKW inequality used to describe the monogamy of quantum entanglement?,"  We analyze mixed multi-qubit states composed of a W class state and a product
state with all qubit in |0>. We find the optimal pure state decomposition and
convex roofs for higher-tangle with bipartite partition between one qubit and
the rest qubits for those mixed states. The optimality of the decomposition is
ensured by the Coffman-Kundu-Wootters (CKW) inequality which describes the
monogamy of quantum entanglement. The generalized monogamy inequality is found
to be true for W class states with arbitrary partitions between one qubit and
multi-qubit.
"
What is the relationship between two dynamical Yang-Baxter maps constructed in this paper?,"  By means of left quasigroups L=(L, .) and ternary systems, we construct
dynamical Yang-Baxter maps associated with L, L, and (.) satisfying an
invariance condition that the binary operation (.) of the left quasigroup L
defines. Conversely, this construction characterize such dynamical Yang-Baxter
maps. The unitary condition of the dynamical Yang-Baxter map is discussed.
Moreover, we establish a correspondence between two dynamical Yang-Baxter maps
constructed in this paper. This correspondence produces a version of the
vertex-IRF correspondence.
"
What is the Fermi velocity in a bilayer with a small angle rotation between the layers?,"  Electronic properties of bilayer and multilayer graphene have generally been
interpreted in terms of AB or Bernal stacking. However, it is known that many
types of stacking defects can occur in natural and synthetic graphite; rotation
of the top layer is often seen in scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) studies
of graphite. In this paper we consider a graphene bilayer with a relative small
angle rotation between the layers and calculate the electronic structure near
zero energy in a continuum approximation. Contrary to what happens in a AB
stacked bilayer and in accord with observations in epitaxial graphene we find:
(a) the low energy dispersion is linear, as in a single layer, but the Fermi
velocity can be significantly smaller than the single layer value; (b) an
external electric field, perpendicular to the layers, does not open an
electronic gap
"
What is the relation between the perturbation theory and the dynamical spectrum?,"  We show equivalence of pure point diffraction and pure point dynamical
spectrum for measurable dynamical systems build from locally finite measures on
locally compact Abelian groups. This generalizes all earlier results of this
type. Our approach is based on a study of almost periodicity in a Hilbert
space. It allows us to set up a perturbation theory for arbitrary equivariant
measurable perturbations.
"
What is the origin of the critical resistance in 2D films with line-like defects?,"  Field-tuned superconductor-insulator transition (FSIT) behavior in 2D
isotropic and homogeneous thin films is usually accompanied by a nonvanishing
critical resistance at low $T$. It is shown that, in a 2D film including line
defects paralle to each other but with random positions perpendicular to them,
the (apparent) critical resistance in low $T$ limit vanishes, as in the 1D
quantum superconducting (SC) transition, under a current parallel to the line
defects. This 1D-like critical resistive behavior is more clearly seen in
systems with weaker point disorder and may be useful in clarifying whether the
true origin of FSIT behavior in the parent superconductor is the glass
fluctuation or the quantum SC fluctuation. As a by-product of the present
calculation, it is also pointed out that, in 2D films with line-like defects
with a long but {\it finite} correlation length parallel to the lines, a
quantum metallic behavior intervening the insulating and SC ones appears in the
resistivity curves.
"
What was the electron spin resonance using a standard marker used to verify the polarization control from linear to circular?,"  In this work the authors implemented a resonator based upon microstrip
cavities that permits the generation of microwaves with arbitrary polarization.
Design, simulation, and implementation of the resonators were performed using
standard printed circuit boards. The electric field distribution was mapped
using a scanning probe cavity perturbation technique. Electron spin resonance
using a standard marker was carried out in order to verify the polarization
control from linear to circular.
"
What is the Hubble parameter behavior in the Friedmannian model of the universe?,"  We consider the future dynamics of a transient phantom dominated phase of the
universe in LQC and in the RS braneworld, which both have a non-standard
Friedmann equation. We find that for a certain class of potentials, the Hubble
parameter oscillates with simple harmonic motion in the LQC case and therefore
avoids any future singularity. For more general potentials we find that damping
effects eventually lead to the Hubble parameter becoming constant. On the other
hand in the braneworld case we find that although the type I singularity can be
avoided, the scale factor still diverges at late times.
"
What are the timing properties of the source of the atoll-type neutron star low-mass X-ray binary 4U 1636-53?,"  We have monitored the atoll-type neutron star low-mass X-ray binary 4U
1636-53 with the Rossi X-Ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) for more than 1.5 years.
Our campaign consisted of short (~2 ks) pointings separated by two days,
regularly monitoring the spectral and timing properties of the source. During
the campaign we observed a clear long-term oscillation with a period of ~30-40
days, already seen in the light curves from the RXTE All-Sky Monitor, which
corresponded to regular transitions between the hard (island) and soft (banana)
states. We detected kHz QPOs in about a third of the observations, most of
which were in the soft (banana) state. The distribution of the frequencies of
the peak identified as the lower kHz QPO is found to be different from that
previously observed in an independent data set. This suggests that the kHz QPOs
in the system shows no intrinsically preferred frequency.
"
What is the relationship between the Klein-Gordon equation and the Gross-Perry-Sorkin monopole solution?,"  We investigate solutions of the Klein-Gordon equation in a class of five
dimensional geometries presenting the same symmetries and asymptotic structure
as the Gross-Perry-Sorkin monopole solution. Apart from globally regular
metrics, we consider also squashed Kaluza-Klein black holes backgrounds.
"
What is the structure of the near-surface convection zone of a star like HD 209625?,"  The goal is to test the structure of hot metallic stars, and in particular
the structure of a near-surface convection zone using asteroseismic
measurements. Indeed, stellar models including a detailed treatement of the
radiative diffusion predict the existence of a near-surface convection zone in
order to correctly reproduce the anomalies in surface abundances that are
observed in Am stars. The Am star HD 209625 was observed with the Harps
spectrograph mounted on the 3.6-m telescope at the ESO La Silla Observatory
(Chile) during 9 nights in August 2005. This observing run allowed us to
collect 1243 radial velocity (RV) measurements, with a standard deviation of
1.35 m/s. The power spectrum associated with these RV measurements does not
present any excess. Therefore, either the structure of the external layers of
this star does not allow excitation of solar-like oscillations, or the
amplitudes of the oscillations remain below 20-30 cm/s (depending on their
frequency range).
"
How can the spectral sequence be used to reprove and generalize results of a theorem on homological epimorphisms?,"  We consider the change-of-rings spectral sequence as it applies to Hochschild
cohomology, obtaining a description of the differentials on the first page
which relates it to the multiplicative stucture on cohomology. Using this
information, we are able to completely describe the cohomology structure of
monogenic algebras as well as some information on the structure of the
cohomology in more general situations.
  We also show how to use the spectral sequence to reprove and generalize
results of M. Auslander et. al. about homological epimorphisms. We derive from
this a rather general version of the long exact sequence due to D. Happel for a
one-point (co)-extension of a finite dimensional algebra and show how it can be
put to use in concrete examples.
"
What are the roles of the mediator in a sponsored search auction?,"  A mediator is a well-known construct in game theory, and is an entity that
plays on behalf of some of the agents who choose to use its services, while the
rest of the agents participate in the game directly. We initiate a game
theoretic study of sponsored search auctions, such as those used by Google and
Yahoo!, involving {\em incentive driven} mediators. We refer to such mediators
as {\em for-profit} mediators, so as to distinguish them from mediators
introduced in prior work, who have no monetary incentives, and are driven by
the altruistic goal of implementing certain desired outcomes. We show that in
our model, (i) players/advertisers can improve their payoffs by choosing to use
the services of the mediator, compared to directly participating in the
auction; (ii) the mediator can obtain monetary benefit by managing the
advertising burden of its group of advertisers; and (iii) the payoffs of the
mediator and the advertisers it plays for are compatible with the incentive
constraints from the advertisers who do dot use its services. A simple
intuition behind the above result comes from the observation that the mediator
has more information about and more control over the bid profile than any
individual advertiser, allowing her to reduce the payments made to the
auctioneer, while still maintaining incentive constraints. Further, our results
indicate that there are significant opportunities for diversification in the
internet economy and we should expect it to continue to develop richer
structure, with room for different types of agents to coexist.
"
What are the implications of the two conjectures for the generation of a fat point scheme and the behavior of the cotangent bundle with respect to some rational curves?,"  We study the connection between the generation of a fat point scheme
supported at general points in the plane and the behaviour of the cotangent
bundle with respect to some rational curves particularly relevant for the
scheme. We put forward two conjectures, giving examples and partial results in
support of them.
"
What are the radiative and collisional parton energy losses in an expanding quark-gluon plasma?,"  We perform a comparison of the radiative and collisional parton energy losses
in an expanding quark-gluon plasma. The radiative energy loss is calculated
within the light-cone path integral approach. The collisional energy loss is
calculated using the Bjorken method with an accurate treatment of the binary
collision kinematics. Our numerical results demonstrate that for RHIC and LHC
conditions the collisional energy loss is relatively small in comparison to the
radiative one. We find an enhancement of the heavy quark radiative energy loss
as compared to that of the light quarks at high energies.
"
What is the influence of premelting on the conductivity and molecular structure of DNA-lipid films?,"  We have measured temperature dependent (between 20 and 80 C) electrical
conductivity and molecular structure (Raman spectroscopy) of DNA-lipid cast
film. Our findings show that the conductivity is strongly influenced by
premelting effects in the molecular structure starting near physiological
temperatures (~40 C), prior to the global DNA denaturation.
"
What are the results of phase field modeling compared to atomistic calculations for nanoferroelectrics?,"  Phase field modeling of domain structures in ferroelectrics nanorods of
different shape and sizes is presented. The vortex domain configurations in
confined ferroelectrics have been explored by varying the ratio of the energies
of electrostatic and elastic interactions. It is shown that a strong effect of
the electrostatic interactions can cause the formation of 90o domain walls that
do not satisfy the condition of strain compatibility. A good agreement between
the results of phase field modeling and the results of atomistic calculations
for nano ferroelectrics demonstrates that the phase field approach provides an
effective tool for the analysis of domain structures in nano-ferroelectrics.
"
What is the perturbative QCD approach based on kT factorization?,"  The perturbative QCD approach is based on $k_T$ factorization, including the
Sudakov form factors so that to avoid the endpoint singularity. In this
approach, we calculate the charmless B decays like $B\to \pi\pi$ decays etc. to
produce the right number of branching ratios and also CP asymmetry parameters.
For final states with at least one charmed meson, like $B\to D\pi$ decays, our
results also agree with the experiments.
"
What is the energy dependence of the resonant KN amplitude in the three-body equation?,"  Three-body resonances in the \bar{K}NN system have been studied within a
framework of the \bar{K}NN-\pi YN coupled hannel Faddeev equation. By solving
the three-body equation the energy dependence of the resonant \bar{K}N
amplitude is fully taken into account. The S-matrix pole has been investigated
from the eigenvalue of the kernel with the analytic continuation of the
scattering amplitude on the unphysical Riemann sheet. The \barKN interaction is
constructed from the leading order term of the chiral Lagrangian using
relativistic kinematics. The \Lambda(1405) resonance is dynamically generated
in this model, where the \bar{K}N interaction parameters are fitted to the data
of scattering length. As a result we find a three-body resonance of the strange
dibaryon system with binding energy, B~79 MeV, and width, \Gamma~74 MeV. The
energy of the three-body resonance is found to be sensitive to the model of the
I=0 \barKN interaction.

What is the possibility of a dark energy universe emerging from an action with higher-order string loop corrections in Einstein gravity in the presence of a massless dilaton?,"  We investigate the possibility of a dark energy universe emerging from an
action with higher-order string loop corrections to Einstein gravity in the
presence of a massless dilaton. These curvature corrections (up to $R^4$ order)
are different depending upon the type of (super)string model which is
considered. We find in fact that Type II, heterotic, and bosonic strings
respond differently to dark energy. A dark energy solution is shown to exist in
the case of the bosonic string, while the other two theories do not lead to
realistic dark energy universes. Detailed analysis of the dynamical stability
of the de-Sitter solution is presented for the case of a bosonic string. A
general prescription for the construction of a de-Sitter solution for the
low-energy (super)string effective action is also indicated. Beyond the
low-energy (super)string effective action, when the higher-curvature correction
coefficients depend on the dilaton, the reconstruction of the theory from the
universe expansion history is done with a corresponding prescription for the
scalar potentials.
"
What are the superweakly-interacting massive particles in supersymmetry models?,"  The instability of dark matter may produce visible signals in the spectrum of
cosmic gamma-rays. We consider this possibility in frameworks with additional
spatial dimensions and supersymmetry. Examples of particles include
superweakly-interacting massive particles such as gravitinos in supersymmetry
models, the lightest Kaluza-Klein (KK) state in models with universal extra
dimensions, and weakly-interacting massive particles such as branons in
flexible brane-worlds.
"
What are the possible experimental tests for the photon mass that violate Lorentz symmetry?,"  We review the case for the photon having a tiny mass compatible with the
experimental limits. We go over some possible experimental tests for such a
photon mass including the violation of Lorentz symmetry. We point out that such
violations may already have been witnessed in tests involving high energy gamma
rays from outer space as also ultra high energy cosmic rays.
"
What are the parameters estimations in the DGP brane-world model with a high curvature Gauss-Bonnet term in the bulk?,"  Using the data coming from the new 182 Gold type Ia supernova samples, the
baryon acoustic oscillation measurement from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and
the H(z) data, we have performed a statistical joint analysis of the DGP
brane-world model with a high curvature Gauss-Bonnet term in the bulk.
Consistent parameters estimations show that the Gauss-Bonnet-Induced Gravity
model is a viable candidate to explain the observed acceleration of our
universe.
"
What are the implications of the observed asymmetry between the electron and hole bands?,"  We report studies of cyclotron resonance in monolayer graphene. Cyclotron
resonance is detected using the photoconductive response of the sample for
several different Landau level occupancies. The experiments measure an electron
velocity at the K- (Dirac) point of $c_{K}^{*}$ = 1.093 x 10$^{6}$ ms$^{-1}$
and in addition detect a significant asymmetry between the electron and hole
bands, leading to a difference in the electron and hole velocities of 5% by
energies of 125 meV away from the Dirac point.
"
What are the key parameters in the degradation of the CNT thin film model?,"  In this paper, we model the evolution and self-assembly of randomly oriented
carbon nanotubes (CNTs), grown on a metallic substrate in the form of a thin
film for field emission under diode configuration. Despite high output, the
current in such a thin film device often decays drastically. The present paper
is focused on understanding this problem. A systematic, multiphysics based
modelling approach is proposed. First, a nucleation coupled model for
degradation of the CNT thin film is derived, where the CNTs are assumed to
decay by fragmentation and formation of clusters. The random orientation of the
CNTs and the electromechanical interaction are then modeled to explain the
self-assembly. The degraded state of the CNTs and the electromechanical force
are employed to update the orientation of the CNTs. Field emission current at
the device scale is finally obtained by using the Fowler-Nordheim equation and
integration over the computational cell surfaces on the anode side. The
simulated results are in close agreement with the experimental results. Based
on the developed model, numerical simulations aimed at understanding the
effects of various geometric parameters and their statistical features on the
device current history are reported.
"
What are the free resonances regions for the elasticity system in a convex body?,"  We obtain free of resonances regions for the elasticity system in the
exterior of a strictly convex body with dissipative boundary conditions under
some natural assumptions on the behaviour of the geodesics on the boundary.
"
What are the three-dimensional generalization of the equation of nonstationary transonic gas flows?,"  Using certain finite-dimensional stable range of the nonlinear terms, we
obtain large families of exact solutions parameterized by functions for the
equation of nonstationary transonic gas flows discovered by Lin, Reisner and
Tsien, and its three-dimensional generalization.
"
What are the implications of the paramagnetic state in a ferromagnet with finite size?,"  High resolution X-ray scattering measurements on single crystal Tb2Ti2O7
reveal finite structural correlations at low temperatures. This geometrically
frustrated pyrochlore is known to exhibit a spin liquid, or cooperative
paramagnetic state, at temperatures below ~ 20 K. Parametric studies of
structural Bragg peaks appropriate to the Fd$\bar{3}$m space group of Tb2Ti2O7
reveal substantial broadening and peak intensity reduction in the temperature
regime 20 K to 300 mK. We also observe a small, anomalous lattice expansion on
cooling below a density maximum at ~ 18 K. These measurements are consistent
with the development of fluctuations above a cooperative Jahn-Teller,
cubic-tetragonal phase transition at very low temperatures.
"
What are the cross sections for the E1 and E2 transitions relevant for energies as low as 10 MeV/nucleon?,"  We investigate the Coulomb excitation of low-lying states of unstable nuclei
in intermediate energy collisions ($E_{lab}\sim10-500$ MeV/nucleon). It is
shown that the cross sections for the $E1$ and $E2$ transitions are larger at
lower energies, much less than 10 MeV/nucleon. Retardation effects and Coulomb
distortion are found to be both relevant for energies as low as 10 MeV/nucleon
and as high as 500 MeV/nucleon. Implications for studies at radioactive beam
facilities are discussed.
"
How are these distributions constructed and those that are invariant under the semi-simple part of G?,"  We study distributions on a Euclidean Jordan algebra V with values in a
finite dimensional representation space for the identity component G of the
structure group of V and homogeneous equivariance condition. We show that such
distributions exist if and only if the representation is spherical, and that
then the dimension of the space of these distributions is r+1 (where r is the
rank of V). We give also construction of these distributions and of those that
are invariant under the semi-simple part of G.
"
What are the analytical expressions for the electric dipole moment and chromo electric dipole moment of a fermion?,"  The two-loop contribution to the electric dipole moment (EDM) and the chromo
electric dipole moment (CEDM) of an arbitrary fermion f induced by the most
general renormalizable tbW coupling with complex left- and right-handed
components (a_L and a_R) is calculated. The analytical expressions are
numerically evaluated and the current experimental constraints on the electron,
neutron and mercury atom EDMs are used to obtain a bound on the complex phase
Im(a^*_La_R). It is found that the most stringent constraint, Im(a^*_La_R)<2.33
X 10^{-2}, arises from the neutron EDM.
"
What are the results of the observations of three IM Class 0 protostars with the PdBI?,"  The transition between the low density groups of T Tauri stars and the high
density clusters around massive stars occurs in the intermediate-mass (IM)
range (M$_*$$\sim$2--8 M$_\odot$). High spatial resolution studies of IM young
stellar objects (YSO) can provide important clues to understand the clustering
in massive star forming regions.
  Aims: Our aim is to search for clustering in IM Class 0 protostars. The high
spatial resolution and sensitivity provided by the new A configuration of the
Plateau de Bure Interferometer (PdBI) allow us to study the clustering in these
nearby objects.
  Methods: We have imaged three IM Class 0 protostars (Serpens-FIRS 1, IC 1396
N, CB 3) in the continuum at 3.3 and 1.3mm using the PdBI. The sources have
been selected with different luminosity to investigate the dependence of the
clustering process on the luminosity of the source.
  Results: Only one millimeter (mm) source is detected towards the low
luminosity source Serpens--FIRS 1. Towards CB 3 and IC1396 N, we detect two
compact sources separated by $\sim$0.05 pc. The 1.3mm image of IC 1396 N, which
provides the highest spatial resolution, reveal that one of these cores is
splitted in, at least, three individual sources.
"
How can conformal field theory be used to construct composite-fermion wave functions for fractional quantum Hall states?,"  It is known that a subset of fractional quantum Hall wave functions has been
expressed as conformal field theory (CFT) correlators, notably the Laughlin
wave function at filling factor $\nu=1/m$ ($m$ odd) and its quasiholes, and the
Pfaffian wave function at $\nu=1/2$ and its quasiholes. We develop a general
scheme for constructing composite-fermion (CF) wave functions from conformal
field theory. Quasiparticles at $\nu=1/m$ are created by inserting anyonic
vertex operators, $P_{\frac{1}{m}}(z)$, that replace a subset of the electron
operators in the correlator. The one-quasiparticle wave function is identical
to the corresponding CF wave function, and the two-quasiparticle wave function
has correct fractional charge and statistics and is numerically almost
identical to the corresponding CF wave function. We further show how to exactly
represent the CF wavefunctions in the Jain series $\nu = s/(2sp+1)$ as the CFT
correlators of a new type of fermionic vertex operators, $V_{p,n}(z)$,
constructed from $n$ free compactified bosons; these operators provide the CFT
representation of composite fermions carrying $2p$ flux quanta in the $n^{\rm
th}$ CF Landau level. We also construct the corresponding quasiparticle- and
quasihole operators and argue that they have the expected fractional charge and
statistics. For filling fractions 2/5 and 3/7 we show that the chiral CFTs that
describe the bulk wave functions are identical to those given by Wen's general
classification of quantum Hall states in terms of $K$-matrices and $l$- and
$t$-vectors, and we propose that to be generally true. Our results suggest a
general procedure for constructing quasiparticle wave functions for other
fractional Hall states, as well as for constructing ground states at filling
fractions not contained in the principal Jain series.
"
What is the Heisenberg spin-1/2 chain in an external magnetic field?,"  We show that atoms trapped in micro-cavities that interact via exchange of
virtual photons can model an anisotropic Heisenberg spin-1/2 chain in an
external magnetic field. All parameters of the effective Hamiltonian can
individually be tuned via external lasers. Since the occupation of excited
atomic levels and photonic states are strongly suppressed, the effective model
is robust against decoherence mechanisms, has a long lifetime and its
implementation is feasible with current experimental technology. The model
provides a feasible way to create cluster states in these devices.
"
What are the inevitable mathematical deductions of the given first-order Dirac equation with the position-dependent mass of the electron?,"  We show that one of exact solutions of the second-order Dirac-Coulomb
equation were pseudo. In the corresponding original literature, it was
considered that the mass of the electron with a Coulomb potential was
position-dependent, but the obtained eigenvalues set was not the inevitable
mathematical deduction of the given second-order Dirac equation, and the
second-order Dirac equations were not the inevitable mathematical deduction of
the given couplet first-order Dirac equation with the position-dependent mass
of the electron. In the present paper, we obtain the correct solution of the
introduced first-order differential equations. This new solution would be
tenable only when the wave equation is correct, but there is not any experiment
date to validate the so-called position-dependent of the electron in the
Coulomb field.
"
What is the jamming coverage of a mixture that depends on the local geometry of the objects in the mixture?,"  Random sequential adsorption of binary mixtures of extended objects on a
two-dimensional triangular lattice is studied numerically by means of Monte
Carlo simulations. The depositing objects are formed by self-avoiding random
walks on the lattice. We concentrate here on the influence of the symmetry
properties of the shapes on the kinetics of the deposition processes in
two-component mixtures. Approach to the jamming limit in the case of mixtures
is found to be exponential, of the form: $\theta(t) \sim
\theta_{jam}-\Delta\theta \exp (-t/\sigma),$ and the values of the parameter
$\sigma$ are determined by the order of symmetry of the less symmetric object
in the mixture. Depending on the local geometry of the objects making the
mixture, jamming coverage of a mixture can be either greater than both
single-component jamming coverages or it can be in between these values.
Results of the simulations for various fractional concentrations of the objects
in the mixture are also presented.
"
What is the impact of reionization on the galaxy bias in surveys of Lyman-break galaxies?,"  We consider the effect of reionization on the clustering properties of galaxy
samples at intermediate redshifts (z~0.3-5.5). Current models for the
reionization of intergalactic hydrogen predict that overdense regions will be
reionized early, thus delaying the build up of stellar mass in the progenitors
of massive lower-redshift galaxies. As a result, the stellar populations
observed in intermediate redshift galaxies are somewhat younger and hence
brighter in overdense regions of the Universe. Galaxy surveys would therefore
be sensitive to galaxies with a somewhat lower dark matter mass in overdense
regions. The corresponding increase in the observed number density of galaxies
can be parameterized as a galaxy bias due to reionization. We model this
process using merger trees combined with a stellar synthesis code. Our model
demonstrates that reionization has a significant effect on the clustering
properties of galaxy samples that are selected based on their star-formation
properties. The bias correction in Lyman-break galaxies (including those in
proposed baryonic oscillation surveys at z<1) is at the level of 10-20% for a
halo mass of 10^12 solar masses, leading to corrections factors of 1.5-2 in the
halo mass inferred from measurements of clustering length. The reionization of
helium could also lead to a sharp increase in the amplitude of the galaxy
correlation function at z~3. We find that the reionization bias is
approximately independent of scale and halo mass. However since the traditional
galaxy bias is mass dependent, the reionization bias becomes relatively more
important for lower mass systems. The correction to the bias due to
reionization is very small in surveys of luminous red galaxies at z<1.
"
What are the results of the measurements of the CP violation parameters in B0 -> Kspi0pi0 and B0 -> KsKs decays?,"  We present a measurement of the CP violation parameters in B0 ->Kspi0pi0 and
B0 -> KsKs decays using a data sample containing 657x10^6 BBbar pairs collected
with the Belle detector at the KEKB asymmetric-energy e+e- collider operating
at the Y(4S) resonance. We measure
  SKspi0pi0 = +0.43+/-0.49+/-0.09,
  AKspi0pi0 = -0.17+/-0.24+/-0.06,
  SKsKs = -0.38+/-0.77+/-0.08 and
  AKsKs = -0.38+/-0.38+/-0.05,
  where the first and second errors are statistical and systematic,
respectively.
"
How does the frequency of AGNs in galaxies correlate with their dynamical mass?,"  The first spectroscopic census of AGNs associated to late-type galaxies in
the Virgo cluster is carried on by observing 213 out of a complete set of 237
galaxies more massive than M_dyn>10^{8.5} solar masses. Among them, 77 are
classified as AGNs (including 21 transition objects, 47 LINERs and 9 Seyferts),
and comprize 32% of the late-type galaxies in Virgo. Due to spectroscopic
incompleteness at most 21 AGNs are missed in the survey, so that the fraction
would increase up to 41%. Using corollary Near-IR observations, that enable us
to estimate galaxies dynamical masses, it is found that AGNs are hosted
exclusively in massive galaxies, i.e. M_dyn\gsim 10^{10} solar masses. Their
frequency increases steeply with the dynamical mass from zero at
M_dyn\approx10^{9.5} solar masses to virtually 1 at M_dyn>10^{11.5} solar
masses. These frequencies are consistent with the ones of low luminosity AGNs
found in the general field by the SDSS. Massive galaxies that harbor AGNs
commonly show conspicuous r-band star-like nuclear enhancements. Conversely
they often, but not necessarily contain massive bulges. Few well known AGNs
(e.g. M61, M100, NGC4535) are found in massive Sc galaxies with little or no
bulge. The AGN fraction seems to be only marginally sensitive to galaxy
environment. We infer the black hole masses using the known scaling relations
of quiescent black holes. No black holes lighter than $\sim 10^6$ \msol are
found active in our sample.
"
What are the universal crossing points in the compressibility and susceptibility?,"  We study the thermodynamics of the one-dimensional extended Hubbard model at
half-filling using a density-matrix renormalization group method applied to
transfer matrices. We show that the various phase transitions in this system
can be detected by measuring usual thermodynamic quantities like the isothermal
compressibility and the uniform magnetic susceptibility. For the isothermal
compressibility we show that universal crossing points exist which allow to
accurately determine the line where the charge gap vanishes. By studying in
addition several correlation functions, we confirm the existence of a phase
with long-range dimer order (bond order) which has been a matter of debate for
several years. According to our calculations this phase is located in a narrow
region between the spin-density and charge-density wave phases up to a
tricritical point which we estimate to be at $U_t=6.7\pm 0.2$, $V_t =3.5\pm
0.1$. Our results for the phase diagram are in good agreement with the most
recent zero-temperature density-matrix renormalization group study, however,
they disagree in some important aspects from the most recent
Quantum-Monte-Carlo study.
"
What are the observables of the Einstein-Rosen waves?,"  In this account we investigate an asymptotically flat space-time geometry. In
particular, we focus on a pure gravity model with cylindrical symmetry where no
matter fields are included. The Einstein-Rosen metric is introduced and the
corresponding Einstein equations are solved. By use of the ADM formalism, we
derive the observables of the cylindrical gravitational waves. We conclude with
an analysis of the algebra of the observables of the Einstein-Rosen waves.
"
"What is the unprecedented depth to which the extinction law A_\lambda/A_K was calculated in the Barnard 59 star-forming, dense core?","  We combined sensitive near-infrared data obtained with ground-based imagers
on the ESO NTT and VLT telescopes with space mid-infrared data acquired with
the IRAC imager on the Spitzer Space Telescope to calculate the extinction law
A_\lambda/A_K as a function of \lambda between 1.25 and 7.76 micron to an
unprecedented depth in Barnard 59, a star forming, dense core located in the
Pipe Nebula. The ratios A_\lambda/A_K were calculated from the slopes of the
distributions of sources in color-color diagrams \lambda-K vs. H-K. The
distributions in the color-color diagrams are fit well with single slopes to
extinction levels of A_K ~ 7 (A_V ~ 59 mag). Consequently, there appears to be
no significant variation of the extinction law with depth through the B59 line
of sight. However, when slopes are translated into the relative extinction
coefficients A_\lambda/A_K, we find an extinction law which departs from the
simple extrapolation of the near-infrared power law extinction curve, and
agrees more closely with a dust extinction model for a cloud with a total to
selective absorption R_V=5.5 and a grain size distribution favoring larger
grains than those in the diffuse ISM. Thus, the difference we observe could be
possibly due to the effect of grain growth in denser regions. Finally, the
slopes in our diagrams are somewhat less steep than those from the study of
Indebetouw et al. (2005) for clouds with lower column densities, and this
indicates that the extinction law between 3 and 8 micron might vary slightly as
a function of environment.
"
What are the Boltzmann equations for leptogenesis including decay and scattering processes?,"  We obtain the Boltzmann equations for leptogenesis including decay and
scattering processes with two and three body initial or final states. We
present an explicit computation of the CP violating scattering asymmetries. We
analyze their possible impact in leptogenesis, and we discuss the validity of
their approximate expressions in terms of the decay asymmetry. In scenarios in
which the initial heavy neutrino density vanishes, the inclusion of CP
asymmetries in scatterings can enforce a cancellation between the lepton
asymmetry generated at early times and the asymmetry produced at later times.
We argue that a sizeable amount of washout is crucial for spoiling this
cancellation, and we show that in the regimes in which the washouts are
particularly weak, the inclusion of CP violation in scatterings yields a
reduction in the final value of the lepton asymmetry. In the strong washout
regimes the inclusion of CP violation in scatterings still leads to a
significant enhancement of the lepton asymmetry at high temperatures; however,
due to the independence from the early conditions that is characteristic of
these regimes, the final value of the lepton asymmetry remains approximately
unchanged.
"
What is the setup used to measure in ferromagnetic microstrips?,"  We have constructed a noise measurement setup for high impedance carbon
nanotube samples. Our setup, working in the frequency range of 600 - 900 MHz,
takes advantage of the fact that the shot noise power is reasonably large for
high impedance sources so that relatively large, fixed non-matching conditions
can be tolerated.
"
"What are the key concepts in a discrete mathematics, in terms of new words?","  A little general abstract combinatorial nonsense delivered in this note is a
presentation of some old and basic concepts, central to discrete mathematics,
in terms of new words. The treatment is from a structural and systematic point
of view. This note consists essentially of definitions and summaries.
"
What are the scaling limits of 2D lattice models of physical phenomena?,"  Many 2D lattice models of physical phenomena are conjectured to have
conformally invariant scaling limits: percolation, Ising model, self-avoiding
polymers, ... This has led to numerous exact (but non-rigorous) predictions of
their scaling exponents and dimensions. We will discuss how to prove the
conformal invariance conjectures, especially in relation to Schramm-Loewner
Evolution.
"
What are the results of direct numerical simulations of the reduced dynamical equations of rotating stratified turbulence?,"  To investigate the formation mechanism of energy spectra of internal waves in
the oceans, direct numerical simulations are performed. The simulations are
based on the reduced dynamical equations of rotating stratified turbulence. In
the reduced dynamical equations only wave modes are retained, and vortices and
horizontally uniform vertical shears are excluded. Despite the simplifications,
our simulations reproduce some key features of oceanic internal-wave spectra:
accumulation of energy at near-inertial waves and realistic frequency and
horizontal wavenumber dependencies. Furthermore, we provide evidence that
formation of the energy spectra in the inertial subrange is dominated by
scale-separated interactions with the near-inertial waves. These findings
support oceanographers' intuition that spectral energy density of internal
waves is the result of predominantly wave-wave interactions.
"
What is the key to improving the energy resolution of the combined signal?,"  A strong anti-correlation between ionization and scintillation signals
produced by MeV gamma-rays in liquid xenon has been measured and used to
improve the energy resolution by combining the two signals. The improvement is
explained by reduced electron-ion recombination fluctuations of the combined
signal compared to fluctuations of the individual signals. Simultaneous
measurements of ionization and scintillation signals were carried out with
Cs-137, Na-22 and Co-60 gamma rays, as a function of electric field in the
liquid. A resolution of 1.7%(sigma) at 662 keV was measured at 1 kV/cm,
significantly better than the resolution from either scintillation or
ionization alone. A detailed analysis indicates that further improvement to
less than 1%(sigma) is possible with higher light collection efficiency and
lower electronic noise.
"
What is the phenomenon of circular optical birefringence?,"  The photon helicity may be mapped to a spin-1/2, whereby we put forward an
intrinsic interaction between a polarized light beam as a ``photon spin
current'' and a pure spin current in a semiconductor, which arises from the
spin-orbit coupling in valence bands as a pure relativity effect without
involving the Rashba or the Dresselhaus effect due to inversion asymmetries.
The interaction leads to circular optical birefringence, which is similar to
the Faraday rotation in magneto-optics but nevertheless involve no net
magnetization. The birefringence effect provide a direct, non-demolition
measurement of pure spin currents.
"
What is the Hubbard model in the strong-coupling regime and what are its limitations in explaining high-temperature superconductivity?,"  The Hubbard model in the strong-coupling regime is mainly studied by
Kondo-lattice theory or 1/d expansion theory, with d the spatial
dimensionality. In two dimensions and higher, the ground state within the
Hilbert subspace with no order parameter is a normal Fermi liquid except for
n=1 and U/W=+infinity, with n the electron density per unit cell, U the on-site
repulsion, and W the bandwidth; the cooperation between the Kondo effect, which
favors a local singlet on each unit cell, and a resonating-valence-bond effect,
which favors a local singlet on each pair of nearest-neighbor unit cells,
stabilizes the Fermi liquid, whose ground state is a singlet as a whole, in the
strong-coupling regime. In the whole Hilbert space with no restriction, the
normal Fermi liquid is unstable at least against a magnetic or superconducting
state. This analysis confirms an early Fermi-liquid theory of high-temperature
superconductivity, F. J. Ohkawa, Jpn. J. Appl. Phys. 26, L652 (1987). The
ground state for n=1 and U/W=+infinity is a Mott insulator. Actual
metal-insulator transitions cannot be explained within the Hubbard model. In
order to explain them, the electron-phonon interaction, multi-band or
multi-orbital effects, and effects of disorder should be considered beyond the
Hubbard model. The crossover between local-moment magnetism and
itinerant-electron magnetism corresponds to that between a localized spin and a
normal Fermi liquid in the Kondo effect and it is simply a Mott metal-insulator
crossover.
"
What is the analytic proof of the finite generation of the canonical ring for a compact complex algebraic manifold of general type?,"  This set of notes provides some additional explanatory material on the
analytic proof of the finite generation of the canonical ring for a compact
complex algebraic manifold of general type.
"
What are the implications of the observation of slow fluctuations of helical antiferromagnetic domains in an ultra-thin holmium film?,"  We report the direct observation of slow fluctuations of helical
antiferromagnetic domains in an ultra-thin holmium film using coherent resonant
magnetic x-ray scattering. We observe a gradual increase of the fluctuations in
the speckle pattern with increasing temperature, while at the same time a
static contribution to the speckle pattern remains. This finding indicates that
domain-wall fluctuations occur over a large range of time scales. We ascribe
this non-ergodic behavior to the strong dependence of the fluctuation rate on
the local thickness of the film.
"
What is the relationship between the X-ray and weak-lensing masses of galaxy clusters?,"  We compare X-ray and weak-lensing masses for four galaxy clusters that
comprise the top-ranked shear-selected cluster system in the Deep Lens Survey.
The weak-lensing observations of this system, which is associated with A781,
are from the Kitt Peak Mayall 4-m telescope, and the X-ray observations are
from both Chandra and XMM-Newton. For a faithful comparison of masses, we adopt
the same matter density profile for each method, which we choose to be an NFW
profile. Since neither the X-ray nor weak-lensing data are deep enough to well
constrain both the NFW scale radius and central density, we estimate the scale
radius using a fitting function for the concentration derived from cosmological
hydrodynamic simulations and an X-ray estimate of the mass assuming
isothermality. We keep this scale radius in common for both X-ray and
weak-lensing profiles, and fit for the central density, which scales linearly
with mass. We find that for three of these clusters, there is agreement between
X-ray and weak-lensing NFW central densities, and thus masses. For the other
cluster, the X-ray central density is higher than that from weak-lensing by 2
sigma. X-ray images suggest that this cluster may be undergoing a merger with a
smaller cluster. This work serves as an additional step towards understanding
the possible biases in X-ray and weak-lensing cluster mass estimation methods.
Such understanding is vital to efforts to constrain cosmology using X-ray or
weak-lensing cluster surveys to trace the growth of structure over cosmic time.
"
What are the implications of the infrared spectroscopy for the analysis of high-energy reactions in different kinematic regions in the double-logarithmic approximation?,"  It is a brief review on composing and solving Infrared Evolution Equations.
They can be used in order to calculate amplitudes of high-energy reactions in
different kinematic regions in the double-logarithmic approximation.
"
What are the ordering properties of the Artin braid group Bn?,"  Dehornoy showed that the Artin braid groups $B_n$ are left-orderable. This
ordering is discrete, but we show that, for $n >2$ the Dehornoy ordering, when
restricted to certain natural subgroups, becomes a dense ordering. Among
subgroups which arise are the commutator subgroup and the kernel of the Burau
representation (for those $n$ for which the kernel is nontrivial). These
results follow from a characterization of least positive elements of any normal
subgroup of $B_n$ which is discretely ordered by the Dehornoy ordering.
"
How do the initial density profile and the bounce affect the neutronization burst and the neutrino spectra in massive iron cores?,"  The existence of various anomalous stars, such as the first stars in the
universe or stars produced by stellar mergers, has been recently proposed. Some
of these stars will result in black hole formation. In this study, we
investigate iron core collapse and black hole formation systematically for the
iron-core mass range of 3 - 30Msun, which has not been studied well so far.
Models used here are mostly isentropic iron cores that may be produced in
merged stars in the present universe but we also employ a model that is meant
for a Population III star and is obtained by evolutionary calculation. We solve
numerically the general relativistic hydrodynamics and neutrino transfer
equations simultaneously, treating neutrino reactions in detail under spherical
symmetry. As a result, we find that massive iron cores with ~10Msun
unexpectedly produce a bounce owing to the thermal pressure of nucleons before
black hole formation. The features of neutrino signals emitted from such
massive iron cores differ in time evolution and spectrum from those of ordinary
supernovae. Firstly, the neutronization burst is less remarkable or disappears
completely for more massive models because the density is lower at the bounce.
Secondly, the spectra of neutrinos, except the electron type, are softer owing
to the electron-positron pair creation before the bounce. We also study the
effects of the initial density profile, finding that the larger the initial
density gradient is, the more steeply the neutronization burst declines.
Further more, we suggest a way to probe into the black hole progenitors from
the neutrino emission and estimate the event number for the currently operating
neutrino detectors.
"
What are the implications of the equivariant principal G-bundles for the geometry of accretion flow in X-ray binaries?,"  We introduce a new construction, the isotropy groupoid, to organize the orbit
data for split $\Gamma$-spaces. We show that equivariant principal $G$-bundles
over split $\Gamma$-CW complexes $X$ can be effectively classified by means of
representations of their isotropy groupoids. For instance, if the quotient
complex $A=\Gamma\backslash X$ is a graph, with all edge stabilizers toral
subgroups of $\Gamma$, we obtain a purely combinatorial classification of
bundles with structural group $G$ a compact connected Lie group. If $G$ is
abelian, our approach gives combinatorial and geometric descriptions of some
results of Lashof-May-Segal and Goresky-Kottwitz-MacPherson.
"
What are the implications of the double polytrope model on the stability of stars?,"  This paper is an investigation of the stability of some ideal stars. It is
in- tended as a study in General Relativity, with emphasis on the coupling to
matter, eventually aimed at a better understanding of very strong gravitational
fields and Black Holes. The work is based on an action principle for the
complete system of metric and matter fields. We propose a complete revision of
the treatment of boundary conditions. An ideal star in our terminology has
spherical symmetry and an isentropic equation of state. In our first work on
this subject it was assumed that the density vanishes beyond a finite distance
from the origin. But it is difficult to decide what the proper boundary
conditions should be and we are consequently skeptical of the concept of a
fixed boundary. In this paper we investigate the double polytrope,
characterized by a polytropic index n less than 5 in the bulk of the star and a
value larger than 5 in an outer atmosphere that extends to infinity. It has no
fixed boundary but a region of critical density where the polytropic index
changes from a value that is appropriate for the bulk of the star to a value
that provides a crude model for the atmosphere. The existence of a relation
between mass and radius is confirmed, as well as an upper limit on the mass.
The principal conclusion is that all the static configurations are stable.
"
What are the implications of the treatment of screening electrons in the cluster?,"  The quantum-classical hybrid-description of rare-gas clusters interacting
with intense light pulses which we have developed is described in detail. Much
emphasis is put on the treatment of screening electrons in the cluster which
set the time scale for the evolution of the system and form the link between
electrons strongly bound to ions and quasi-free plasma electrons in the
cluster. As an example we discuss the dynamics of an Ar147 cluster exposed to a
short VUV laser pulse of 20eV photon energy.
"
What is the temperature range where the moduli are finite in a glass forming system?,"  We address the interesting temperature range of a glass forming system where
the mechanical properties are intermediate between those of a liquid and a
solid. We employ an efficient Monte-Carlo method to calculate the elastic
moduli, and show that in this range of temperatures the moduli are finite for
short times and vanish for long times, where `short' and `long' depend on the
temperature. By invoking some exact results from statistical mechanics we offer
an alternative method to compute shear moduli using Molecular Dynamics
simulations, and compare those to the Monte-Carlo method. The final conclusion
is that these systems are not ""viscous fluids"" in the usual sense, as their
actual time-dependence concatenates solid-like materials with varying local
shear moduli.
"
What is the Cauchy initial condition in the Heaviside equation?,"  In his paper the heating of the fullerenes by ultra-short laser pulses is
investigated. The thermal Heaviside equation is formulated and solved for the
Cauchy initial condition The effective thermal relaxation time is calculated..
  Key words: fullerenes, Heaviside thermal equation, effective thermal
relaxation time.
"
What is the SU(4)k model of superconductivity?,"  We extend the SU(4) model [1-5] for high-Tc superconductivity to an SU(4)k
model that permits explicit momentum (k) dependence in predicted observables.
We derive and solve gap equations that depend on k, temperature, and doping
from the SU(4)k coherent states, and show that the new SU(4)k model reduces to
the original SU(4) model for observables that do not depend explicitly on
momentum. The results of the SU(4)k model are relevant for experiments such as
ARPES that detect explicitly k-dependent properties. The present SU(4)k model
describes quantitatively the pseudogap temperature scale and may explain why
the ARPES-measured T* along the anti-nodal direction is larger than other
measurements that do not resolve momentum. It also provides an immediate
microscopic explanation for Fermi arcs observed in the pseudogap region. In
addition, the model leads to a prediction that even in the underdoped regime,
there exist doping-dependent windows around nodal points in the k-space, where
antiferromagnetism may be completely suppressed for all doping fractions,
permitting pure superconducting states to exist.
"
What are the design principles for microwave devices with the field vortex structures?,"  In microwave resonant systems with ferrite samples, one becomes faced with
specific phase relations for the electromagnetic fields. Such specific phase
relations may lead to appearance of nontrivial states: electromagnetic
vortices. This paper provides some general ideas and design principles for
microwave devices with the field vortex structures.
"
What is the relationship between the fragmentation cross sections measured using the primary beam of $^{86}$Kr at 64 MeV/nucleon on $^{9}$Be and $^{181}$Ta targets?,"  We measured fragmentation cross sections produced using the primary beam of
$^{86}$Kr at 64 MeV/nucleon on $^9$Be and $^{181}$Ta targets. The cross
sections were obtained by integrating the momentum distributions of isotopes
with 25<Z<36 measured using the RIPS fragment separator at RIKEN. The
cross-section ratios obtained with the $^{181}$Ta and $^{9}$Be targets depend
on the fragment masses, contrary to the simple geometrical models. We compared
the extracted cross sections to EPAX; an empirical parameterization of
fragmentation cross sections. Predictions from current EPAX parameterization
severely overestimate the production cross sections of very neutron-rich
isotopes. Attempts to obtain another set of EPAX parameters specific to the
reaction studied here, to extrapolate the neutron-rich nuclei more accurately
have not been very successful, suggesting that accurate predictions of
production cross sections of nuclei far from the valley of stability require
information of nuclear properties which are not present in EPAX.
"
What is the uniform large deviations principle (LDP) for a family of renewal measures?,"  Let (X_n,Y_n) be i.i.d. random vectors. Let W(x) be the partial sum of Y_n
just before that of X_n exceeds x>0. Motivated by stochastic models for neural
activity, uniform convergence of the form $\sup_{c\in I}|a(c,x)\operatorname
{Pr}\{W(x)\gecx\}-1|=o(1)$, $x\to\infty$, is established for probabilities of
large deviations, with a(c,x) a deterministic function and I an open interval.
To obtain this uniform exact large deviations principle (LDP), we first
establish the exponentially fast uniform convergence of a family of renewal
measures and then apply it to appropriately tilted distributions of X_n and the
moment generating function of W(x). The uniform exact LDP is obtained for cases
where X_n has a subcomponent with a smooth density and Y_n is not a linear
transform of X_n. An extension is also made to the partial sum at the first
exceedance time.
"
What is the case study of the calibration of the time-dependent parameters to the volatility surface?,"  This paper presents a methodology to introduce time-dependent parameters for
a wide family of models preserving their analytic tractability. This family
includes hybrid models with stochastic volatility, stochastic interest-rates,
jumps and their non-hybrid counterparts. The methodology is applied to Heston's
model. A bootstrapping algorithm is presented for calibration. A case study
works out the calibration of the time-dependent parameters to the volatility
surface of the Eurostoxx 50 index. The methodology is also applied to the
analytic valuation of forward start vanilla options driven by Heston's model.
This result is used to explore the forward skew of the case study.
"
What are the Canham-Helfrich bending energy and spontaneous curvature?,"  A phase field model for dealing with shape instabilities in fluid membrane
vesicles is presented. This model takes into account the Canham-Helfrich
bending energy with spontaneous curvature. A dynamic equation for the
phase-field is also derived. With this model it is possible to see the vesicle
shape deformation dynamically, when some external agent instabilizes the
membrane, for instance, inducing an inhomogeneous spontaneous curvature. The
numerical scheme used is detailed and some stationary shapes are shown together
with a shape diagram for vesicles of spherical topology and no spontaneous
curvature, in agreement with known results.
"
What are the implications of the Hawking radiation for the effective theory of near-horizon physics?,"  We explore the method of Robinson and Wilczek for deriving the Hawking
temperature of a black hole. In this method, the Hawking radiation restores
general covariance in an effective theory of near-horizon physics which
otherwise exhibits a gravitational anomaly at the quantum level. The method has
been shown to work for broad classes of black holes in arbitrary spacetime
dimensions. These include static black holes, accreting or evaporating black
holes, charged black holes, rotating black holes, and even black rings. In the
case of charged and rotating black holes, the expected super-radiant current is
also reproduced.
"
What are the implications of the Anderson-like contribution in the actinides for the delocalization transition as a function of atomic number across the actinide series?,"  We present a detailed analysis of the one-electron physics of the actinides.
Various LMTO basis sets are analyzed in order to determine a robust bare
Hamiltonian for the actinides. The hybridization between f- an spd- states is
compared with the f-f hopping in order to understand the Anderson-like and
Hubbard-like contributions to itineracy in the actinides. We show that both
contributions decrease strongly as one move from the light actinides to the
heavy actinides, while the Anderson-like contribution dominates in all cases. A
real-space analysis of the band structure shows that nearest-neighbor hopping
dominates the physics in these materials. Finally, we discuss the implications
of our results to the delocalization transition as function of atomic number
across the actinide series.
"
What are the characteristics of the radial basis functions in the native space?,"  In this paper we consider the approximation of functions by radial basis
function interpolants. There is a plethora of results about the asymptotic
behaviour of the error between appropriately smooth functions and their
interpolants, as the interpolation points fill out a bounded domain in R^d. In
all of these cases, the analysis takes place in a natural function space
dictated by the choice of radial basis function - the native space. In many
cases, the native space contains functions possessing a certain amount of
smoothness. We address the question of what can be said about these error
estimates when the function being interpolated fails to have the required
smoothness. These are the rough functions of the title. We limit our discussion
to surface splines, as an exemplar of a wider class of radial basis functions,
because we feel our techniques are most easily seen and understood in this
setting.
"
What is the relationship between galaxy number counts and the extinction of galaxies at low Galactic latitude?,"  Galactic extinction is tested using galaxy number counts at low Galactic
latitude obtained from five band photometry of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey.
The spatial variation of galaxy number counts for low extinction regions of
$E(B-V) < 0.15$ is consistent with the all-sky reddening map of Schlegel,
Finkbeiner, & Davis (1998) and the standard extinction law. For higher
extinction regions of $E(B-V) > 0.15$, however, the map of Schlegel et
al.(1998) overestimates the reddening by a factor up to 1.4, which is likely
ascribed to the departure from proportionality of reddening to infrared
emissivity of dust. This result is consistent with the analysis of Arce &
Goodman (1999) for the Taurus dark cloud complex.
"
What are the three objective functions for the optimization of the Slide-o-Cam?,"  The multiobjective optimization of Slide-o-Cam is reported in this paper.
Slide-o-Cam is a cam mechanism with multiple rollers mounted on a common
translating follower. This transmission provides pure-rolling motion, thereby
reducing the friction of rack-and-pinions and linear drives. A Pareto frontier
is obtained by means of multiobjective optimization. This optimization is based
on three objective functions: (i) the pressure angle, which is a suitable
performance index for the transmission because it determines the amount of
force transmitted to the load vs. that transmitted to the machine frame; (ii)
the Hertz pressure used to evaluate the stresses produced on the contact
surface between cam and roller; and (iii) the size of the mechanism,
characterized by the number of cams and their width.
"
What is the relationship between the growth of the substrate temperature and the absorption/emission characteristics of the growing layer in GaMnAs?,"  Remarkably big increase of the substrate temperature during the
low-temperature MBE growth of GaMnAs layers is observed by means of band gap
spectroscopy. It is explained and simulated in terms of changes in the
absorption/emission characteristics of the growing layer. Options for the
temperature variation damping are discussed.
"
How can the Debye-Waller Factor be incorporated into electronic structure calculations to explain temperature-dependent phenomena in alloys?,"  A first principles analysis of order-disorder transition in alloys shows that
ordering energy is a function of temperature due to thermal vibrations. The
inter-nuclear potential energy term converges if zero point vibrations are
incorporated and this method can replace the Ewald sum method. Core energy
contributions to the ordering energy are stored exclusively in superlattice
lines. The effect of electron-phonon interactions on ordering energy is of the
same order of magnitude as ordering energy near transition temperatures and
cannot be ignored. Ising model and variants are incorrect in explaining alloy
phase transitions as they ignore the role of electron-phonon interactions
without justification. A theoretical formalism that incorporates the
Debye-Waller Factor component of electron-phonon interactions in electronic
structure calculations already exists and must be adopted when modeling
temperature dependent phenomena. It is suggested that DWF correction will
account substantially for the discrepancy between experimental and theoretical
ordering energy in Ni3V. Thermal vibrations alter magnetic ordering energy at
finite temperatures. The role of electron-phonon interactions in alloy and
magnetic phase transitions cannot be ignored and must be incorporated in all
models. This will also ensure consistency with x-ray and electron diffraction
(alloy transitions) and neutron diffraction (magnetic transitions) results. An
isotope effect is predicted for (magnetic) phase transitions if the transition
temperature is below Debye temperature. Recent observations of an isotope
effect in magnetic phase transitions confirm our above conclusions and imply
that the role of electron-phonon interactions must be incorporated in all
theories and models of magnetism to avoid contradictions.
"
"What are the implications of the universal field of minimum acceleration for the order of c/t, c the speed of light and t the age of the Universe?","  Taking into account only luminous objects, the kinematics of clusters of
galaxies, galaxies and their interior, require a much higher mass than the
luminous one to explain the observations. This situation has provoked more than
30 years of intense research and has stimulated hypothesis like the dark
matter. Also new mechanical theories, different from Newton (like the Modified
Newtonian Dynamics), have been proposed. We here present an alternative:
theoretical and observational data strongly suggest the existence of a
universal field of minimum acceleration of the order of c/t, c the speed of
light and t the age of the Universe. We keep our reasoning within the present
state of the art of Quantum Mechanics, Relativity and Newtonian Mechanics. With
this approach the kinematics of the luminous objects are explained without any
additional assumption. At the same time the sizes of all structures in the
Universe, from protons up to the Universe, are explained as due to the constant
action of this field.
"
What is the elasticity difference tensor in the context of space-time?,"  The elasticity difference tensor, used in [1] to describe elasticity
properties of a continuous medium filling a space-time, is here analysed from
the point of view of the space-time connection. Principal directions associated
with this tensor are compared with eigendirections of the material metric.
Examples concerning spherically symmetric and axially symmetric space-times are
then presented.
"
What are the challenges in measuring jets in hadron collisions?,"  Jets in hadron collisions are very complicated with a long learning curve
replete with errors. In relativistic heavy ion (RHI) collisions, it is likely
that jets will be much more complicated with an even longer and more difficult
learning curve. Hard scattering is more easily observed via single particle and
few particle correlation measurements. The main advantage of jets is higher
rate at large $p_T$, plus the possibility of detailed studies of soft
fragmentation if the soft fragments can be separated from the background. A
critical review of the possibility of using jets as a probe of hard-scattering
in RHI collisions is presented along with other probes and measurements which
the author considers much more likely to reveal the interesting physics in
Pb+Pb collisions at the LHC. Finally, a list of unanswered questions raised by
results at RHIC is presented.
"
What are the local integrals of motion I_n for the deformed W-algebra Wqt(sl_N^)?,"  We review the deformed W-algebra Wqt(sl_N^) and its screening currents. We
explicitly construct the local integrals of motion I_n for this deformed
W-algebra. We explicitly construct the nonlocal integrals of motion G_n by
means of the screening currents. Our integrals of motion commute with each
other, and give the elliptic version of those for the Virasoro algebra and the
W-algebra W(sl_3^), obtained by V.Bazhanov, A.Hibberd, S.Khoroshkin, S.Lukyanov
and Al.Zamolodchikov.
"
What is the nature of the percolation transition in a correlated network?,"  We introduce an exponential random graph model for networks with a fixed
degree distribution and with a tunable degree-degree correlation. We then
investigate the nature of a percolation transition in the correlated network
with the Poisson degree distribution. It is found that negative correlation is
irrelevant in that the percolation transition in the disassortative network
belongs to the same universality class of the uncorrelated network. Positive
correlation turns out to be relevant. The percolation transition in the
assortative network is characterized by the non-diverging mean size of finite
clusters and power-law scalings of the density of the largest cluster and the
cluster size distribution in the non-percolating phase as well as at the
critical point. Our results suggest that the unusual type percolation
transition in the growing network models reported recently may be inherited
from the assortative degree-degree correlation.
"
What are the higher tor-modules of a persistence module?,"  We study the multi-dimensional persistence of Carlsson and Zomorodian and
obtain a finer classification based upon the higher tor-modules of a
persistence module. We propose a variety structure on the set of isomorphism
classes of these modules, and present several examples. We also provide a
geometric interpretation for the higher tor-modules of homology modules of
multi-filtered simplicial complexes.
"
What are the benefits of using equality constraints in Kalman filtering?,"  We discuss two separate techniques for Kalman Filtering in the presence of
state space equality constraints. We then prove that despite the lack of
similarity in their formulations, under certain conditions, the two methods
result in mathematically equivalent constrained estimate structures. We
conclude that the potential benefits of using equality constraints in Kalman
Filtering often outweigh the computational costs, and as such, equality
constraints, when present, should be enforced by way of one of these two
methods.
"
What are the kinematic variables reconstructed in the CHORUS experiment?,"  The CHORUS experiment, designed to search for $\nu_{\mu}\to\nu_{\tau}$
oscillations, consists of a nuclear emulsion target and electronic detectors.
In this paper, results on the production of charged particles in a small sample
of charged-current neutrino-- and anti-neutrino--nucleus interactions at high
energy are presented. For each event, the emission angle and the ionization
features of the charged particles produced in the interaction are recorded,
while the standard kinematic variables are reconstructed using the electronic
detectors. The average multiplicities for charged tracks, the pseudo-rapidity
distributions, the dispersion in the multiplicity of charged particles and the
KNO scaling are studied in different kinematical regions. A study of
quasi-elastic topologies performed for the first time in nuclear emulsions is
also reported. The results are presented in a form suitable for use in the
validation of Monte Carlo generators of neutrino--nucleus interactions.
"
What are the predictions of the polarization fractions of the vector meson final states?,"  The perturbative QCD approach has achieved great success in the study of
hadronic B decays. Utilizing the constrained parameters in these well measured
decay channels, we study most of the possible charmless $B_s \to PP$, $PV$ and
$VV$ decay channels in the perturbative QCD approach. In addition to the
branching ratios and CP asymmetries, we also give predictions to the
polarization fractions of the vector meson final states. The size of SU(3)
breaking effect is also discussed. All of these predictions can be tested by
the future LHCb experiment.
"
What is the relationship between the globular cluster mass function (GCMF) and the half-mass density (rho_h) of clusters?,"  We show that the globular cluster mass function (GCMF) in the Milky Way
depends on cluster half-mass density (rho_h) in the sense that the turnover
mass M_TO increases with rho_h while the width of the GCMF decreases. We argue
that this is the expected signature of the slow erosion of a mass function that
initially rose towards low masses, predominantly through cluster evaporation
driven by internal two-body relaxation. We find excellent agreement between the
observed GCMF -- including its dependence on internal density rho_h, central
concentration c, and Galactocentric distance r_gc -- and a simple model in
which the relaxation-driven mass-loss rates of clusters are approximated by
-dM/dt = mu_ev ~ rho_h^{1/2}. In particular, we recover the well-known
insensitivity of M_TO to r_gc. This feature does not derive from a literal
``universality'' of the GCMF turnover mass, but rather from a significant
variation of M_TO with rho_h -- the expected outcome of relaxation-driven
cluster disruption -- plus significant scatter in rho_h as a function of r_gc.
Our conclusions are the same if the evaporation rates are assumed to depend
instead on the mean volume or surface densities of clusters inside their tidal
radii, as mu_ev ~ rho_t^{1/2} or mu_ev ~ Sigma_t^{3/4} -- alternative
prescriptions that are physically motivated but involve cluster properties
(rho_t and Sigma_t) that are not as well defined or as readily observable as
rho_h. In all cases, the normalization of mu_ev required to fit the GCMF
implies cluster lifetimes that are within the range of standard values
(although falling towards the low end of this range). Our analysis does not
depend on any assumptions or information about velocity anisotropy in the
globular cluster system.
"
What is the extinction efficiency of composite spheroidal grains for three axial ratios computed using the discrete dipole approximation (DDA)?,"  The composite grain is made up of a host silicate spheroid and graphite
inclusions. The extinction efficiencies of the composite spheroidal grains for
three axial ratios are computed using the discrete dipole approximation (DDA).
The interstellar extinction curve is evaluated in the spectral region
3.40--0.10$\mu m$ using the extinction efficiencies of the composite spheroidal
grains. The model extinction curves are then compared with the average observed
interstellar extinction curve. We also calculate the linear polarization for
the spheroidal composite grains at three orientation angles and find the
wavelength of maximum polarization. Further, we estimate the volume extinction
factor, an important parameter from the point of view of cosmic abundance, for
the composite grain models that reproduce the average observed interstellar
extinction. The estimated abundances derived from the composite grain models
for both carbon and silicon are found to be lower than that are predicted by
the bare silicate/graphite grain models but these values are still higher than
that are implied from the recent ISM values.
"
What is the information obtained from the Electron Spin Resonance (ESR) of YbRh2Si2?,"  Below the Kondo temperature the heavy Fermion compound YbRh$_{2}$Si$_{2}$
shows a well defined Electron Spin Resonance (ESR) with local Yb$^{3+}$
properties. We report a detailed analysis of the ESR intensity which gives
information on the number of ESR active centers relative to the ESR of well
localized Yb$^{3+}$ in YPd$_3$:Yb. The ESR lineshape is investigated regarding
contributions from itinerant centers. From the ESR of monoisotopic
$^{174}$YbRh$_{2}$Si$_{2}$ we could exclude unresolved hyperfine contributions
to the lineshape.
"
What is the Lindblom-Detweiler formalism used to describe w-mode oscillations of neutron stars?,"  Adopting the Lindblom-Detweiler formalism for polar oscillations of neutron
stars, we study the $w$-mode oscillation and find that the Lagrangian change in
pressure, measured by the physical quantity $X$, is negligibly small. Based on
this observation, we develop the generalised inverse-Cowling approximation
(GICA) with the approximation $X=X'=0$, where $X'$ is the derivative of $X$
with respect to the circumferential radius, for $w$-mode oscillations of
neutron stars. Under GICA, $w$-mode oscillations are described by a
second-order differential system, which can yield accurate frequencies and
damping rates of quasi-normal modes.
"
What are the effects of radiative torques (RATs) on the alignment of grains in the presence of anisotropic radiation flux?,"  We study the physical processes that affect the alignment of grains subject
to radiative torques (RATs). To describe the action of RATs, we use the
analytical model (AMO) of RATs introduced in Paper I. We focus our discussion
on the alignment by anisotropic radiation flux with respect to magnetic field,
which defines the axis of grain Larmor precession. Such an alignment does not
invoke paramagnetic dissipation (i.e. Davis-Greenstein mechanism), but,
nevertheless, grains tend to be aligned with long axes perpendicular to the
magnetic field. When we account for thermal fluctuations within grain material,
we show that for grains, which are characterized by a triaxial ellipsoid of
inertia, the zero-$J$ attractor point obtained in our earlier study develops
into a low-$J$ attractor point. We study effects of stochastic gaseous
bombardment and show that gaseous bombardment can drive grains from low-$J$ to
high-$J$ attractor points in cases when the high-$J$ attractor points are
present. As the alignment of grain axes with respect to angular momentum is
higher for higher values of $J$, counter-intuitively, gaseous bombardment can
increase the degree of grain alignment in respect to the magnetic field. We
also study the effects of torques induced by H$_2$ formation and show that they
can change the value of angular momentum at high-$J$ attractor point, but
marginally affect the value of angular momentum at low-$J$ attractor points. We
compare the AMO results with those obtained using the direct numerical
calculations of RATs acting upon irregular grains and validate the use of the
AMO for realistic situations of RAT alignment.
"
What is the relationship between monadic second-order logic (MSO) and monadic second-order logic (CMSO)?,"  We compare the expressiveness of two extensions of monadic second-order logic
(MSO) over the class of finite structures. The first, counting monadic
second-order logic (CMSO), extends MSO with first-order modulo-counting
quantifiers, allowing the expression of queries like ``the number of elements
in the structure is even''. The second extension allows the use of an
additional binary predicate, not contained in the signature of the queried
structure, that must be interpreted as an arbitrary linear order on its
universe, obtaining order-invariant MSO.
  While it is straightforward that every CMSO formula can be translated into an
equivalent order-invariant MSO formula, the converse had not yet been settled.
Courcelle showed that for restricted classes of structures both order-invariant
MSO and CMSO are equally expressive, but conjectured that, in general,
order-invariant MSO is stronger than CMSO.
  We affirm this conjecture by presenting a class of structures that is
order-invariantly definable in MSO but not definable in CMSO.
"
What is the measurement of the two-photon width times the branching ratio of the Higgs boson decaying into b-quarks?,"  A study of the measurement of the two photon decay width times the branching
ratio of a Higgs boson with the mass of 120 GeV in photon - photon collisions
is presented, assuming a gamma-gamma integrated luminosity of 80 fb^-1 in the
high energy part of the spectrum. The analysis is based on the reconstruction
of the Higgs events produced in the gamma gamma --> H process, followed by the
decay of the Higgs into a bbbar pair. A statistical error of the measurement of
the two-photon width times the branching ratio of the Higgs boson decaying into
b-quarks is found to be 2.1% for one year of data taking.
"
How is the characterization of stable queueing networks under non-preemptive static buffer priority scheduling policies and deterministic interarrival and service times possible?,"  One of the basic properties of a queueing network is stability. Roughly
speaking, it is the property that the total number of jobs in the network
remains bounded as a function of time. One of the key questions related to the
stability issue is how to determine the exact conditions under which a given
queueing network operating under a given scheduling policy remains stable.
While there was much initial progress in addressing this question, most of the
results obtained were partial at best and so the complete characterization of
stable queueing networks is still lacking. In this paper, we resolve this open
problem, albeit in a somewhat unexpected way. We show that characterizing
stable queueing networks is an algorithmically undecidable problem for the case
of nonpreemptive static buffer priority scheduling policies and deterministic
interarrival and service times. Thus, no constructive characterization of
stable queueing networks operating under this class of policies is possible.
The result is established for queueing networks with finite and infinite buffer
sizes and possibly zero service times, although we conjecture that it also
holds in the case of models with only infinite buffers and nonzero service
times. Our approach extends an earlier related work [Math. Oper. Res. 27 (2002)
272--293] and uses the so-called counter machine device as a reduction tool.
"
What is the origin of the wave-particle duality in the context of scattering in disordered media?,"  Wave-particle duality finds a natural application for electrons or light
propagating in disordered media where coherent corrections to transport are
given by two-wave interference. For scatterers with internal degrees of
freedom, these corrections are observed to be much smaller than would be
expected for structureless scatterers. By examining the basic example of the
scattering of one photon by two spin-1/2 atoms--a case-study for coherent
backscattering--we demonstrate that the loss of interference strength is
associated with which-path information stored by the scattering atoms.
"
What is the uncertainty of the arrival direction of cosmic rays modeled in the Auger surface detector array?,"  The precise determination of the arrival direction of cosmic rays is a
fundamental prerequisite for the search for sources or the study of their
anisotropies on the sky. One of the most important aspects to achieve an
optimal measurement of these directions is to properly take into account the
measurement uncertainties in the estimation procedure. In this article we
present a model for the uncertainties associated with the time measurements in
the Auger surface detector array. We show that this model represents well the
measurement uncertainties and therefore provides the basis for an optimal
determination of the arrival direction. With this model and a description of
the shower front geometry it is possible to estimate, on an event by event
basis, the uncertainty associated with the determination of the arrival
directions of the cosmic rays.
"
What is the connection between the Hubble constant H0 and the expansion of the universe?,"  On the basis of the nonisometric transformations subgroup of the SO(4.2)
group, the nonlinear time inhomogeneity one-parameter conformal transformations
are constructed. The connection between the group parameter and the Hubble
constant H0 is established. It is shown that the existence of an anomalous
blue-shifted frequency drift is a pure kinematic manifestation of the time
inhomogeneity induced by the Universe expansion. This conclusion is confirmed
via a generalization of the standard Special Relativity clock synchronization
procedure to the space expanding case. The obtained formulae are in accordance
with the observable Pioneer Anomaly effect. The anomalous blue-shifted drift is
universal, does not depend on the presence of graviting centers and can be, in
principle, observed on any frequencies under suitable experimental conditions.
The explicit analytic expression for the speed of recession--intergalactic
distance ratio is obtained in the form of a function of the red shift z valid
in the whole range of its variation. In the small z limit this expression
exactly reproduces the Hubble law. The maximum value of this function at
z=0.475 quantitatively corresponds to the experimentally found value z(exp) =
0.46 +/- 0.13 of the transition from the decelerated to the accelerated
expansion of the Universe.
"
What are the implications of the momentum transfer of local operators in the model?,"  It is shown that only one vacuum state can be prepared with a finite amount
of energy and it appears, in particular, as a limit of physical states under
large timelike translations in any theory which satisfies a phase space
condition proposed in this work. This new criterion, related to the concept of
additivity of energy over isolated subsystems, is verified in massive free
field theory. The analysis entails very detailed results about the momentum
transfer of local operators in this model.
"
What are the implications of the new channels for the detection of free-floating planets?,"  We classify various types of planetary lensing signals and the channels of
detecting them. We estimate the relative frequencies of planet detections
through the individual channels with special emphasis on the new channels to be
additionally provided by future lensing experiments that will survey wide
fields continuously at high cadence by using very large-format imaging cameras.
  From this investigation, we find that the fraction of wide-separation planets
that would be discovered through the new channels of detecting planetary
signals as independent and repeating events would be substantial. We estimate
that the fraction of planets detectable through the new channels would comprise
~15 -- 30% of all planets depending on the models of the planetary separation
distribution and mass ratios of planets. Considering that a significant
fraction of planets might exist in the form of free-floating planets, the
frequency of planets to be detected through the new channel would be even
higher. With the expansion of the channels of detecting planet, future lensing
surveys will greatly expand the range of planets to be probed.

What is the automated technique for parallelizing quantum circuits via forward and backward translation to measurement-based quantum computing patterns?,"  We present a novel automated technique for parallelizing quantum circuits via
forward and backward translation to measurement-based quantum computing
patterns and analyze the trade off in terms of depth and space complexity. As a
result we distinguish a class of polynomial depth circuits that can be
parallelized to logarithmic depth while adding only polynomial many auxiliary
qubits. In particular, we provide for the first time a full characterization of
patterns with flow of arbitrary depth, based on the notion of influencing paths
and a simple rewriting system on the angles of the measurement. Our method
leads to insightful knowledge for constructing parallel circuits and as
applications, we demonstrate several constant and logarithmic depth circuits.
Furthermore, we prove a logarithmic separation in terms of quantum depth
between the quantum circuit model and the measurement-based model.
"
What is the form of the free energy for the phase field?,"  Phase field crystals (PFC) are a tool for simulating materials at the atomic
level. They combine the small length-scale resolution of molecular dynamics
(MD) with the ability to simulate dynamics on mesoscopic time scales. We show
how PFC can be interpreted as the result of applying coarse-graining in time to
the microscopic density field of molecular dynamics simulations. We take the
form of the free energy for the phase field from the classical density
functional theory of inhomogeneous liquids and then choose coefficients to
match the structure factor of the time coarse-grained microscopic density
field. As an example, we show how to construct a PFC free energy for Weber and
Stillinger's two-dimensional square crystal potential which models a system of
proteins suspended in a membrane.
"
What is the significance of observing pulsars at 92 cm using the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope?,"  A large sample of pulsars has been observed to study their subpulse
modulation at an observing wavelength (when achievable) of both 21 and 92 cm
using the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope. In this paper we present the
92-cm data and a comparison is made with the already published 21-cm results.
We analysed 191 pulsars at 92 cm using fluctuation spectra. The sample of
pulsars is as unbiased as possible towards any particular pulsar
characteristics. For 15 pulsars drifting subpulses are discovered for the first
time and 26 of the new drifters found in the 21-cm data are confirmed. We
discovered nulling for 8 sources and 8 pulsars are found to intermittently emit
single pulses that have pulse energies similar to giant pulses. It is estimated
that at least half of the total population of pulsars have drifting subpulses
when observations with a high enough signal-to-noise ratio would be available.
It could well be that the drifting subpulse mechanism is an intrinsic property
of the emission mechanism itself, although for some pulsars it is difficult or
impossible to detect. Drifting subpulses are in general found at both
frequencies, although the chance of detecting drifting subpulses is possibly
slightly higher at 92 cm. It appears that the youngest pulsars have the most
disordered subpulses and the subpulses become more and more organized into
drifting subpulses as the pulsar ages. The correlations with the modulation
indices are argued to be consistent with the picture in which the radio
emission can be divided in a drifting subpulse signal plus a quasi-steady
signal which becomes, on average, stronger at high observing frequencies. The
measured values of P3 at the two frequencies are highly correlated, but there
is no evidence for a correlation with other pulsar parameters.
"
What are the time-independent and time-dependent configurations with beam guiding properties?,"  We consider a class of electromagnetic fields that contains crossed fields
combined with longitudinal electric and magnetic fields. We study the motion of
a classical particle (solutions of the Lorentz equations) in such fields. Then,
we present an analysis that allows one to decide which fields from the class
act as a beam guide for charged particles, and we find some time-independent
and time-dependent configurations with beam guiding properties. We demonstrate
that the Klein-Gordon and Dirac equations with all the fields from the class
can be solved exactly. We study these solutions, which were not known before,
and prove that they form complete and orthogonal sets of functions.
"
What is the relationship between the polynomial p(t) and the positive coefficients when m = 6?,"  It is shown that the polynomial \[p(t) = \text{Tr}[(A+tB)^m]\] has positive
coefficients when $m = 6$ and $A$ and $B$ are any two 3-by-3 complex Hermitian
positive definite matrices. This case is the first that is not covered by
prior, general results. This problem arises from a conjecture raised by Bessis,
Moussa and Villani in connection with a long-standing problem in theoretical
physics. The full conjecture, as shown recently by Lieb and Seiringer, is
equivalent to $p(t)$ having positive coefficients for any $m$ and any two
$n$-by-$n$ positive definite matrices. We show that, generally, the question in
the real case reduces to that of singular $A$ and $B$, and this is a key part
of our proof.
"
"What are the invariant properties of the family of $L^{m}_{\rho,\de}$-operators?","  The paper constructs the analytic index for an elliptic pseudodifferential
family of $L^{m}_{\rho,\de}$-operators invariant under the proper action of a
continuous family groupoid on a $G$-compact, $C^{\infty,0}$ $G$-space.
"
What is the MT bundle bending rigidity and the elastic constant of the network?,"  We present a model for the spontaneous formation of a striated pattern in
polymerizing microtubule solutions. It describes the buckling of a single
microtubule (MT) bundle within an elastic network formed by other similarly
aligned and buckling bundles and unaligned MTs. Phase contrast and polarization
microscopy studies of the temporal evolution of the pattern imply that the
polymerization of MTs within the bundles creates the driving compressional
force. Using the measured rate of buckling, the established MT force-velocity
curve and the pattern wavelength, we obtain reasonable estimates for the MT
bundle bending rigidity and the elastic constant of the network. The analysis
implies that the bundles buckle as solid rods.
"
What are the techniques for dealing with non-finitely generated algebras?,"  Let G be an affine algebraic group acting on an affine variety
  X. We present an algorithm for computing generators of the invariant ring
K[X]^G in the case where G is reductive. Furthermore, we address the case where
G is connected and unipotent, so the invariant ring need not be finitely
generated. For this case, we develop an algorithm which computes K[X]^G in
terms of a so-called colon-operation. From this, generators of K[X]^G can be
obtained in finite time if it is finitely generated. Under the additional
hypothesis that K[X] is factorial, we present an algorithm that finds a
quasi-affine variety whose coordinate ring is K[X]^G. Along the way, we develop
some techniques for dealing with non-finitely generated algebras. In
particular, we introduce the finite generation locus ideal.
"
What is the relationship between the Zeeman energy and the ground-state energy in partially spin polarized states in v=2/3 fractional quantum Hall systems?,"  We study the domain formation in the v=2/3 fractional quantum Hall systems
basing on the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) analysis. The
ground-state energy and the pair correlation functions are calculated for
various spin polarizations. The results confirm the domain formation in
partially spin polarized states, but the presence of the domain wall increases
the energy of partially spin polarized states and the ground state is either
spin unpolarized state or fully spin polarized state depending on the Zeeman
energy. We expect coupling with external degrees of freedom such as nuclear
spins is important to reduce the energy of partially spin polarized state.
"
What are the results of the analysis of Ds+ --> mu+ nu and Ds+ --> tau+ nu interactions at 4170 MeV?,"  We examine e+e- --> Ds- Ds*+ and Ds*- Ds+ interactions at 4170 MeV using the
CLEO-c detector in order to measure the decay constant fDs+. We use the Ds+ -->
l+ nu channel, where the l+ designates either a mu+ or a tau+, when the tau+
--> pi+ nu. Analyzing both modes independently, we determine B(Ds+ --> mu+ nu)
= (0.594 +- 0.066 +- 0.031)%, and B(Ds+ --> tau+ nu) = (8.0 +- 1.3 +- 0.4)%. We
also analyze them simultaneously to find an effective value of B{eff}(Ds+ -->
mu+ nu) = (0.638 +- 0.059 +- 0.033)% and extract fDs = (274 +- 13 +- 7) MeV.
Combining with our previous determination of B(D+ -> mu+ nu), we also find the
ratio fDs/fD+ = 1.23 +- 0.11 +- 0.04. We compare to current theoretical
estimates. Finally, we find B(Ds+ --> e+ nu) < 1.3 x10^{-4} at 90% confidence
level.
"
What are the characteristics of two-mode amplification in a waveguide array?,"  Theory of monochromatic wave field amplification in a waveguide array based
on expansion of the wave field in terms of guided array modes is developed.
Equations for the expansion coefficients include cross-modal gain, which
completely changes behavior of the amplified wave field. Analysis of two-mode
amplification reveals new unusual features in characteristics of two-mode
amplifier. Instead of unlimited growth of both modes for incoherent fields, one
of the modes grows with no limit and suppresses the lower-power mode. Effects
associated with the cross-modal gain are illustrated analytically on a system
of two thin parallel planar waveguides. Conditions are found when a mode with
lower gain can become the dominant one at the output of amplifier.
"
How are index and materialized views selected in a data warehouse to share storage space?,"  Indices and materialized views are physical structures that accelerate data
access in data warehouses. However, these data structures generate some
maintenance overhead. They also share the same storage space. The existing
studies about index and materialized view selection consider these structures
separately. In this paper, we adopt the opposite stance and couple index and
materialized view selection to take into account the interactions between them
and achieve an efficient storage space sharing. We develop cost models that
evaluate the respective benefit of indexing and view materialization. These
cost models are then exploited by a greedy algorithm to select a relevant
configuration of indices and materialized views. Experimental results show that
our strategy performs better than the independent selection of indices and
materialized views.
"
What are the kinematic features of ttbar events used to extract the cross-section?,"  We present a measurement of the top quark pair production cross section in
ppbar collisions at sqrt(s)=1.96 TeV utilizing 425 pb-1 of data collected with
the D0 detector at the Fermilab Tevatron Collider. We consider the final state
of the top quark pair containing one high-pT electron or muon and at least four
jets. We exploit specific kinematic features of ttbar events to extract the
cross section. For a top quark mass of 175 GeV, we measure sigma_ttbar = 6.4
+1.3-1.2(stat} +/- 0.7(syst)+/- 0.4(lum) pb in good agreement with the standard
model prediction.
"
How does the presence of a companion star affect the distribution of encounter velocities in a planetesimal swarm?,"  We study to which extent planetesimal accretion is affected by the perturbing
presence of a compagnon star. We concentrate on one crucial parameter: the
distribution of encounter velocities within the planetesimal swarm. We
numerically explore the evolution of this parameter taking into account the
secular perturbations of the binary and friction due to the very likely
presence of gas in the disk. $<\Delta v>$ maps are derived, for planetesimals
of different sizes, for a total of 120 binary configurations (eccentricity eb
and separation ab). We identify for each case 3 different accreting behaviours.
1) In regions where no significant dV increase is observed, ``classical''
(i.e., single-star) accretion is possible. 2) In regions where $dV>v_{ero}$,
the threshold velocity above which all impacts are eroding, no accretion is
possible and planet growth is stopped. 3) In between these 2 limiting
behaviours, a large fraction of binary configurations leads to significant dV
increase, but still below the erosion threshold. In this intermediate case,
planetesimal growth can occur, but proceeds slower than in the single-star
case, possibly following the so-called type II runaway groth mode.
"
What is the significance of the Josephson-like behavior of the DC SQUID magnetization in thin carbon arc films?,"  This work presents the study of some new anomalous electromagnetic effects in
graphite-like thin carbon films. These are: The fast switching (1nanosecond) of
electrical conductivity The detection of microwave radiation and its
temperature dependence The oscillations of film stack magnetization in the
magnetic field of 1-5 T. The optical radiation under process of spasmodic
switching of conductivity Results of magnetic force microscopy (MFM), DC SQUID
magnetization, reversed Josephson effect (RJE), and resistance measurements in
thin carbon arc (CA) films are presented. The observation of a RJE induced
voltage as well as its rf frequency, input amplitude, and temperature
dependence reveals the existence of Josephson-like Junction arrays. Oscillating
behavior of the DC SQUID magnetization reminiscent of the Fraunhofer-like
behavior of superconducting (SC) critical current in the range of 10000-50000
Oe has been observed. The DC SQUID magnetization measurement indicates a
possible elementary 102 nm SC loop; this is compared to MFM direct observations
of magnetic clusters with a median size of 165 nm. The results obtained
provides a basis for non-cryogenic elecrtonic devices utilizing the Josephson
effect.
"
What are the key concepts in a non-Fermi liquid model for Spin-Charge separation?,"  The phenomenon of Spin-Charge separation in non-Fermi liquids is well
understood only in certain solvable d=1 fermionic systems. In this paper we
furnish the first example of asymptotic Spin-Charge separation in a d=1 non
solvable model. This goal is achieved using Renormalization Group approach
combined with Ward-Identities and Schwinger-Dyson equations, corrected by the
presence of a bandwidth cut-offs. Such methods, contrary to bosonization, could
be in principle applied also to lattice or higher dimensional systems.
"
What are the self-consistency of the string field theory?,"  The descent relations between string field theory (SFT) vertices are
characteristic relations of the operator formulation of SFT and they provide
self-consistency of this theory. The descent relations <V_2|V_1> and <V_3|V_1>
in the NS fermionic string field theory in the kappa and discrete bases are
established. Different regularizations and schemes of calculations are
considered and relations between them are discussed.
"
Can Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) be distinguished from Newtonian gravity with dark matter by studying the vertical dynamics of disk galaxies?,"  We investigate the possibility of discriminating between Modified Newtonian
Dynamics (MOND) and Newtonian gravity with dark matter, by studying the
vertical dynamics of disk galaxies. We consider models with the same circular
velocity in the equatorial plane (purely baryonic disks in MOND and the same
disks in Newtonian gravity embedded in spherical dark matter haloes), and we
construct their intrinsic and projected kinematical fields by solving the Jeans
equations under the assumption of a two-integral distribution function. We
found that the vertical velocity dispersion of deep-MOND disks can be much
larger than in the equivalent spherical Newtonian models. However, in the more
realistic case of high-surface density disks this effect is significantly
reduced, casting doubts on the possibility of discriminating between MOND and
Newtonian gravity with dark matter by using current observations.
"
What is the nature of the Z_2 duality in the context of the Super-Yang-Mills theory?,"  We show that a certain superfield formalism can be used to find an off-shell
supersymmetric description for some supersymmetric field theories where
conventional superfield formalism does not work. This ""new"" formalism contains
even auxiliary variables in addition to conventional odd super-coordinates. The
idea of this construction is similar to the pure spinor formalism developed by
N.Berkovits. It is demonstrated that using this formalism it is possible to
prove that the certain Chern-Simons-like (Witten's OSFT-like) theory can be
considered as an off-shell version for some on-shell supersymmetric field
theories. We use the simplest non-trivial model found in [2] to illustrate the
power of this pure spinor superfield formalism. Then we redo all the
calculations for the case of 10-dimensional Super-Yang-Mills theory. The
construction of off-shell description for this theory is more subtle in
comparison with the model of [2] and requires additional Z_2 projection. We
discover experimentally (through a direct explicit calculation) a non-trivial
Z_2 duality at the level of Feynman diagrams. The nature of this duality
requires a better investigation.
"
"What are the elementary physics mechanisms underlying the predictions of the ""cannonball"" model of GRBs and XRFs?","  Recent data gathered and triggered by the SWIFT satellite have greatly
improved our knowledge of long-duration gamma ray bursts (GRBs) and X-ray
flashes (XRFs). This is particularly the case for the X-ray data at all times,
and for UV and optical data at very early times. I show that the optical and
X-ray observations are in excellent agreement with the predictions of the
""cannonball"" model of GRBs and XRFs. Elementary physics and just two mechanisms
underlie these predictions: inverse Compton scattering and synchrotron
radiation, generally dominant at early and late times, respectively. I put this
result in its proper context and dedicate the paper to those who planed, built
and operate SWIFT, a true flying jewel.
"
What is the production rate of deuterons in deep inelastic ep scattering measured with the ZEUS detector at HERA?,"  First observation of (anti)deuterons in deep inelastic ep scattering (DIS)
measured with the ZEUS detector at HERA is reported. The production rate of
deuterons is higher than that of antideuterons. However, no asymmetry in the
production rate of protons and antiprotons was found. The (anti)deuteron yield
is approximately three orders of magnitude smaller than that of (anti)protons,
which is consistent with the world measurements.
"
What are the implications of the foreground tracers correlating with the Q- and V-band sky maps individually?,"  We apply a previously developed Gibbs sampling framework to the foreground
corrected 3-yr WMAP polarization data and compute the power spectrum and
residual foreground template amplitude posterior distributions. We first
analyze the co-added Q- and V-band data, and compare our results to the
likelihood code published by the WMAP team. We find good agreement, and thus
verify the numerics and data processing steps of both approaches. However, we
also analyze the Q- and V-bands separately, allowing for non-zero EB
cross-correlations and including two individual foreground template amplitudes
tracing synchrotron and dust emission. In these analyses, we find tentative
evidence of systematics: The foreground tracers correlate with each of the Q-
and V-band sky maps individually, although not with the co-added QV map; there
is a noticeable negative EB cross-correlation at l <~ 16 in the V-band map; and
finally, when relaxing the constraints on EB and BB, noticeable differences are
observed between the marginalized band powers in the Q- and V-bands. Further
studies of these features are imperative, given the importance of the low-l EE
spectrum on the optical depth of reionization tau and the spectral index of
scalar perturbations n_s.
"
"What are the luminosity functions of Lyman-alpha emitters (LAEs) at different redshifts (z=3.1, 3.7, and 5.7)?","  We present luminosity functions (LFs) and various properties of Lya emitters
(LAEs) at z=3.1, 3.7, and 5.7, in a 1 deg^2 sky of the Subaru/XMM-Newton Deep
Survey (SXDS) Field. We obtain a photometric sample of 858 LAE candidates based
on deep Subaru/Suprime-Cam imaging data, and a spectroscopic sample of 84
confirmed LAEs from Subaru/FOCAS and VLT/VIMOS spectroscopy in a survey volume
of ~10^6 Mpc^3 with a limiting Lya luminosity of ~3x10^42 erg/s. We derive the
LFs of Lya and UV-continuum (~1500 \AA) for each redshift, taking into account
the statistical error and the field-to-field variation. We find that the
apparent Lya LF shows no significant evolution between z=3.1 and 5.7 within
factors of 1.8 and 2.7 in L* and phi*, respectively. On the other hand, the UV
LF of LAEs increases from z=3.1 to 5.7, indicating that galaxies with Lya
emission are more common at earlier epochs. We identify six LAEs with AGN
activities from our spectra combined with VLA, Spitzer, and XMM-Newton data.
Among the photometrically selected LAEs at z=3.1 and 3.7, only ~1 % show AGN
activities, while the brightest LAEs with logL(Lya) >~ 43.4-43.6 erg/s appear
to always host AGNs. Our LAEs are bluer in UV-continuum color than dropout
galaxies, suggesting lower extinction and/or younger stellar populations. Our
stacking analyses provide upper limits to the radio luminosity and the
f(HeII)/f(Lya) line fraction, and constrain the hidden star formation
(+low-luminosity AGN) and the primordial population in LAEs.
"
What are the implications of the LHC for the LHC and the LHC?,"  In this letter we consider the consequences for the LHC of light vector-like
exotica with fractional electric charge. It is shown that such states are found
in orbifold constructions of the heterotic string. Moreover, these exotica are
consistent with gauge coupling unification at one loop, even though they do not
come in complete multiplets of SU(5).
"
"Can the Clausius inequality be violated, and can work be extracted from a thermal bath by cyclic variations of a parameter?","  In a PRL [1], the authors claim to show that ""the Clausius inequality can be
violated, and that it is even possible to extract work from a thermal bath by
cyclic variations of a parameter (""perpetuum mobile""), and that the physical
cause for this behavior is traced back to quantum coherence in the presence of
the nonequilibrium bath (sic)"".
"
What is the significance of the segregation of the BSS population in the cluster NGC 1904?,"  By combining high-resolution (HST-WFPC2) and wide-field ground based (2.2m
ESO-WFI) and space (GALEX) observations, we have collected a multi-wavelength
photometric data base (ranging from the far UV to the near infrared) of the
galactic globular cluster NGC1904 (M79). The sample covers the entire cluster
extension, from the very central regions up to the tidal radius. In the present
paper such a data set is used to study the BSS population and its radial
distribution. A total number of 39 bright ($m_{218}\le 19.5$) BSS has been
detected, and they have been found to be highly segregated in the cluster core.
No significant upturn in the BSS frequency has been observed in the outskirts
of NGC 1904, in contrast to other clusters (M 3, 47 Tuc, NGC 6752, M 5) studied
with the same technique. Such evidences, coupled with the large radius of
avoidance estimated for NGC 1904 ($r_{avoid}\sim 30$ core radii), indicate that
the vast majority of the cluster heavy stars (binaries) has already sunk to the
core. Accordingly, extensive dynamical simulations suggest that BSS formed by
mass transfer activity in primordial binaries evolving in isolation in the
cluster outskirts represent only a negligible (0--10%) fraction of the overall
population.
"
What is the quasi-symmetry test used to determine if a Boolean function is symmetric?,"  A Boolean function is symmetric if it is invariant under all permutations of
its arguments; it is quasi-symmetric if it is symmetric with respect to the
arguments on which it actually depends. We present a test that accepts every
quasi-symmetric function and, except with an error probability at most delta>0,
rejects every function that differs from every quasi-symmetric function on at
least a fraction epsilon>0 of the inputs. For a function of n arguments, the
test probes the function at O((n/epsilon)\log(n/delta)) inputs. Our
quasi-symmetry test acquires information concerning the arguments on which the
function actually depends. To do this, it employs a generalization of the
property testing paradigm that we call attribute estimation. Like property
testing, attribute estimation uses random sampling to obtain results that have
only ""one-sided'' errors and that are close to accurate with high probability.
"
What are the membrane configurations in AdS_4 x S^7 in relation to the SU(2) integrable spin chain?,"  We find membrane configurations in AdS_4 x S^7, which correspond to the
continuous limit of the SU(2) integrable spin chain, considered as a limit of
the SU(3) spin chain, arising in N=4 SYM in four dimensions, dual to strings in
AdS_5 x S^5. We also discuss the relationship with the Neumann-Rosochatius
integrable system at the level of Lagrangians, comparing the string and
membrane cases.
"
What are the three main regimes in a Bose-Einstein condensate when pairs of atoms are converted into molecules by single-color photoassociation?,"  We discuss the dynamics of an atomic Bose-Einstein condensate when pairs of
atoms are converted into molecules by single-color photoassociation. Three main
regimes are found and it is shown that they can be understood on the basis of
time-dependent two-body theory. In particular, the so-called rogue dissociation
regime [Phys. Rev. Lett., 88, 090403 (2002)], which has a density-dependent
limit on the photoassociation rate, is identified with a transient regime of
the two-atom dynamics exhibiting universal properties. Finally, we illustrate
how these regimes could be explored by photoassociating condensates of
alkaline-earth atoms.
"
What is the relationship between the time evolution of a generic quantum many-body system and the standard statistical mechanical prescription for its relaxation?,"  Time dynamics of isolated many-body quantum systems has long been an elusive
subject. Very recently, however, meaningful experimental studies of the problem
have finally become possible, stimulating theoretical interest as well.
Progress in this field is perhaps most urgently needed in the foundations of
quantum statistical mechanics. This is so because in generic isolated systems,
one expects nonequilibrium dynamics on its own to result in thermalization: a
relaxation to states where the values of macroscopic quantities are stationary,
universal with respect to widely differing initial conditions, and predictable
through the time-tested recipe of statistical mechanics. However, it is not
obvious what feature of many-body quantum mechanics makes quantum
thermalization possible, in a sense analogous to that in which dynamical chaos
makes classical thermalization possible. For example, dynamical chaos itself
cannot occur in an isolated quantum system, where time evolution is linear and
the spectrum is discrete. Underscoring that new rules could apply in this case,
some recent studies even suggested that statistical mechanics may give wrong
predictions for the outcomes of relaxation in such systems. Here we demonstrate
that an isolated generic quantum many-body system does in fact relax to a state
well-described by the standard statistical mechanical prescription. Moreover,
we show that time evolution itself plays a merely auxiliary role in relaxation
and that thermalization happens instead at the level of individual eigenstates,
as first proposed by J.M. Deutsch and M. Srednicki. A striking consequence of
this eigenstate thermalization scenario is that the knowledge of a single
many-body eigenstate suffices to compute thermal averages-any eigenstate in the
microcanonical energy window will do, as they all give the same result.
"
What are the fundamental laws of nature that can be written in a few lines with absolute precision?,"  Elementary particle physics is the quadrant of nature whose laws can be
written in a few lines with absolute precision and the greatest empirical
adequacy. If this is the case, as I believe it is, it must be possible and is
probably useful to introduce the students and the interested readers to the
entire subject in a compact way. This is the main aim of these Lectures.
"
What is the cosmological variation of the Higgs vacuum expectation value?,"  In many versions of brane model, the modulus field of extra dimensions, the
radion, could have cosmological evolution, which induces variation of the Higgs
vacuum expectation value, $<H>$, resulting in cosmological variation of the
electron mass $m_e$. The formation of Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)
anisotropies is thus affected, causing changes both in the peaks positions and
amplitudes in the CMB power spectra. Using the three-year Wilkinson Microwave
Anisotropies Probe (WMAP) CMB data, with the Hubble parameter $H_0$ fixed to be
the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) result 72 km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$, we obtain a
constraint on $\rho$, the ratio of the value of $<H>$ at CMB recombination to
its present value, to be [0.97, 1.02].
"
What are the generalised Picone-type identities for two half-linear second-order equations?,"  Picone-type identities are established for half-linear ODEs of fourth order
(one-dimensional p-biLaplacian). It is shown that in the linear case they
reduce to the known identities for fourth order linear ODEs. Picone-type
identity known for two half-linear second-order equations is also generalised
to set of equations greater than two.
"
What are the geometric equalities that characterize the isogonal conjugacy of two points with respect to a given triangle?,"  We consider three types of isogonal conjugacy of two points with respect to a
given triangle and characterize any of these types by a geometric equality. As
an application to the Fermat problem with positive weights, we prove that in
the general case the given weights determine uniquely a point X and the
solution to the Fermat problem is the point Y, which is isogonally conjugate of
type I to the point X. We obtain a similar characterization of the solution to
the Fermat problem in the case of mixed weights as well.
"
What are the observational techniques used to detect massive protostellar disks?,"  We compute the molecular line emission of massive protostellar disks by
solving the equation of radiative transfer through the cores and disks produced
by the recent radiation-hydrodynamic simulations of Krumholz, Klein, & McKee.
We find that in several representative lines the disks show brightness
temperatures of hundreds of Kelvin over velocity channels ~10 km s^-1 wide,
extending over regions hundreds of AU in size. We process the computed
intensities to model the performance of next-generation radio and submillimeter
telescopes. Our calculations show that observations using facilities such as
the EVLA and ALMA should be able to detect massive protostellar disks and
measure their rotation curves, at least in the nearest massive star-forming
regions. They should also detect significant sub-structure and non-axisymmetry
in the disks, and in some cases may be able to detect star-disk velocity
offsets of a few km s^-1, both of which are the result of strong gravitational
instability in massive disks. We use our simulations to explore the strengths
and weaknesses of different observational techniques, and we also discuss how
observations of massive protostellar disks may be used to distinguish between
alternative models of massive star formation.
"
What is the relation of quiver mutations to the complete path algebra?,"  We study quivers with relations given by non-commutative analogs of Jacobian
ideals in the complete path algebra. This framework allows us to give a
representation-theoretic interpretation of quiver mutations at arbitrary
vertices. This gives a far-reaching generalization of
Bernstein-Gelfand-Ponomarev reflection functors. The motivations for this work
come from several sources: superpotentials in physics, Calabi-Yau algebras,
cluster algebras.
"
What is the nature of the two GOES M-class flares on 27 October 2003?,"  On 27 October, 2003, two GOES M-class flares occurred in the lapse of three
hours in active region NOAA 10486. The two flares were confined and their
associated brightenings appeared at the same location, displaying a very
similar shape both at the chromospheric and coronal levels. We focus on the
analysis of magnetic field (SOHO/MDI), chromospheric (HASTA, Kanzelhoehe Solar
Observatory, TRACE) and coronal (TRACE) observations. By combining our data
analysis with a model of the coronal magnetic field, we compute the magnetic
field topology associated to the two M flares. We find that both events can be
explained in terms of a localized magnetic reconnection process occurring at a
coronal magnetic null point. This null point is also present at the same
location one day later, on 28 October, 2003. Magnetic energy release at this
null point was proposed as the origin of a localized event that occurred
independently with a large X17 flare on 28 October, 2003, at 11:01 UT. The
three events, those on 27 October and the one on 28 October, are homologous.
Our results show that coronal null points can be stable topological structures
where energy release via magnetic reconnection can happen, as proposed by
classical magnetic reconnection models.
"
What are the conditions under which the level spacing distribution P(S) exhibits linear or quadratic level repulsion?,"  We study the level spacing distribution $P(S)$ of 2D real random matrices
both symmetric as well as general, non-symmetric. In the general case we
restrict ourselves to Gaussian distributed matrix elements, but different
widths of the various matrix elements are admitted. The following results are
obtained: An explicit exact formula for $P(S)$ is derived and its behaviour
close to S=0 is studied analytically, showing that there is linear level
repulsion, unless there are additional constraints for the probability
distribution of the matrix elements. The constraint of having only positive or
only negative but otherwise arbitrary non-diagonal elements leads to quadratic
level repulsion with logarithmic corrections. These findings detail and extend
our previous results already published in a preceding paper. For the {\em
symmetric} real 2D matrices also other, non-Gaussian statistical distributions
are considered. In this case we show for arbitrary statistical distribution of
the diagonal and non-diagonal elements that the level repulsion exponent $\rho$
is always $\rho = 1$, provided the distribution function of the matrix elements
is regular at zero value. If the distribution function of the matrix elements
is a singular (but still integrable) power law near zero value of $S$, the
level spacing distribution $P(S)$ is a fractional exponent pawer law at small
$S$. The tail of $P(S)$ depends on further details of the matrix element
statistics. We explicitly work out four cases: the constant (box) distribution,
the Cauchy-Lorentz distribution, the exponential distribution and, as an
example for a singular distribution, the power law distribution for $P(S)$ near
zero value times an exponential tail.
"
What are the critical current of the nanobridge in the nanoscale regime?,"  A new method of preparation of radio-frequency superconducting quantum
interference devices on MgB2 thin films is presented. The variable-thickness
bridge was prepared by a combination of optical lithography and of the
scratching by an atomic force microscope. The critical current of the
nanobridge was 0.35 uA at 4.2 K. Non-contact measurements of the current-phase
characteristics and of the critical current vs. temperature have been
investigated on our structures.
"
What are the implications of mesons with odd C-parity?,"  We complete the analysis of meson resonance contributions to chiral
low-energy constants of O(p^4) by including all quark-antiquark bound states
with orbital angular momentum less or equal to one. Different tensor meson
Lagrangians used in previous work are shown to produce the same final results
for the low-energy constants once QCD short-distance constraints are properly
implemented. We also discuss the possible relevance of axial-vector mesons with
odd C-parity.
"
What is the magnetic field in an accretion disk estimated from the jet emission region?,"  The magnetic field in an accretion disk is estimated assuming that all of the
angular momentum within prescribed accretion disk radii is removed by a jet.
The magnetic field estimated at the base of the jet is extrapolated to the
blazar emission region using a model for a relativistic axisymmetric jet
combined with some simplifying assumptions based on the relativistic nature of
the flow. The extrapolated magnetic field is compared with estimates based upon
the synchrotron and inverse Compton emission from three blazars, MKN 501, MKN
421 and PKS 2155-304. The magnetic fields evaluated from pure synchrotron self-
Compton models are inconsistent with the magnetic fields extrapolated in this
way. However, in two cases inverse Compton models in which a substantial part
of the soft photon field is generated locally agree well, mainly because these
models imply magnetic field strengths which are closer to being consistent with
Poynting flux dominated jets. This comparison is based on estimating the mass
accretion rate from the jet energy flux. Further comparisons along these lines
will be facilitated by independent estimates of the mass accretion rate in
blazars and by more detailed models for jet propagation near the black hole.
"
What is the role of the Yau-Zaslow formula in the K3 theory?,"  Noether-Lefschetz divisors in the moduli of K3 surfaces are the loci
corresponding to Picard rank at least 2. We relate the degrees of the
Noether-Lefschetz divisors in 1-parameter families of K3 surfaces to the
Gromov-Witten theory of the 3-fold total space. The reduced K3 theory and the
Yau-Zaslow formula play an important role. We use results of Borcherds and
Kudla-Millson for O(2,19) lattices to determine the Noether-Lefschetz degrees
in classical families of K3 surfaces of degrees 2, 4, 6 and 8. For the quartic
K3 surfaces, the Noether-Lefschetz degrees are proven to be the Fourier
coefficients of an explicitly computed modular form of weight 21/2 and level 8.
The interplay with mirror symmetry is discussed. We close with a conjecture on
the Picard ranks of moduli spaces of K3 surfaces.
"
What is the polynomial approach to express the decision version of the Hamiltonian Cycle Problem (HCP)?,"  We demonstrate a polynomial approach to express the decision version of the
directed Hamiltonian Cycle Problem (HCP), which is NP-Complete, as the
Solvability of a Polynomial Equation with a constant number of variables,
within a bounded real space. We first introduce four new Theorems for a set of
periodic Functions with irrational periods, based on which we then use a
trigonometric substitution, to show how the HCP can be expressed as the
Solvability of a single polynomial Equation with a constant number of
variables. The feasible solution of each of these variables is bounded within
two real numbers. We point out what future work is necessary to prove that
P=NP.
"
What are the instabilities of magnetic buoyancy in a smoothly stratified horizontal magnetic field?,"  Motivated by the problem of the formation of active regions from a
deep-seated solar magnetic field, we consider the nonlinear three-dimensional
evolution of magnetic buoyancy instabilities resulting from a smoothly
stratified horizontal magnetic field. By exploring the case for which the
instability is continuously driven we have identified a new mechanism for the
formation of concentrations of magnetic flux.
"
How can you combine two or more valuation estimates into a superior valuation estimate?,"  Obtaining more accurate equity value estimates is the starting point for
stock selection, value-based indexing in a noisy market, and beating benchmark
indices through tactical style rotation. Unfortunately, discounted cash flow,
method of comparables, and fundamental analysis typically yield discrepant
valuation estimates. Moreover, the valuation estimates typically disagree with
market price. Can one form a superior valuation estimate by averaging over the
individual estimates, including market price? This article suggests a Bayesian
framework for combining two or more estimates into a superior valuation
estimate. The framework justifies the common practice of averaging over several
estimates to arrive at a final point estimate.
"
What are the limitations of state-averaging approaches in excited state calculations?,"  To overcome the limitations of the traditional state-averaging approaches in
excited state calculations, where one solves for and represents all states
between the ground state and excited state of interest, we have investigated a
number of new excited state algorithms. Building on the work of van der Vorst
and Sleijpen (SIAM J. Matrix Anal. Appl., 17, 401 (1996)), we have implemented
Harmonic Davidson and State-Averaged Harmonic Davidson algorithms within the
context of the Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG). We have assessed
their accuracy and stability of convergence in complete active space DMRG
calculations on the low-lying excited states in the acenes ranging from
naphthalene to pentacene. We find that both algorithms offer increased accuracy
over the traditional State-Averaged Davidson approach, and in particular, the
State-Averaged Harmonic Davidson algorithm offers an optimal combination of
accuracy and stability in convergence.
"
"What is the commutative differential graded algebra constructed for a model of the rational homotopy type of F(M,k)?","  Let M be a simply-connected closed manifold and consider the (ordered)
configuration space of $k$ points in M, F(M,k). In this paper we construct a
commutative differential graded algebra which is a potential candidate for a
model of the rational homotopy type of F(M,k). We prove that our model it is at
least a Sigma_k-equivariant differential graded model.
  We also study Lefschetz duality at the level of cochains and describe
equivariant models of the complement of a union of polyhedra in a closed
manifold.
"
What are the origins of the stability of cell cycle?,"  Chemical reactions in cell are subject to intense stochastic fluctuations. An
important question is how the fundamental physiological behavior of cell is
kept stable against those noisy perturbations. In this paper a stochastic model
of cell cycle of budding yeast is constructed to analyze the effects of noise
on the cell cycle oscillation. The model predicts intense noise in levels of
mRNAs and proteins, and the simulated protein levels explain the observed
statistical tendency of noise in populations of synchronous and asynchronous
cells. In spite of intense noise in levels of proteins and mRNAs, cell cycle is
stable enough to bring the largely perturbed cells back to the physiological
cyclic oscillation. The model shows that consecutively appearing fixed points
are the origin of this stability of cell cycle.
"
What is the relationship between the stability equation and the geodesic deviation equation in the Jacobi metric?,"  We investigate the exact relation existing between the stability equation for
the solutions of a mechanical system and the geodesic deviation equation of the
associated geodesic problem in the Jacobi metric constructed via the
Maupertuis-Jacobi Principle. We conclude that the dynamical and geometrical
approaches to the stability/instability problem are not equivalent.
"
What is the critical momentum for the occurrence of superfluidity in the two-particle T-matrix?,"  The pole of the two-particle T-matrix including the influence of the
surrounding medium is analyzed for an interacting Bose gas. The phase diagram
of the Bose -Einstein condensation (BEC) depending on the temperature, density,
scattering length, and momentum is derived from this pole. The critical
momentum for the occurrence of superfluidity is obtained in this way. As a new
observation a two- particle binding energy is reported intimately connected
with the occurrence of the BEC. It is suggested that this might have
cosmological consequences on the dark energy problem.
"
What are the two ways to derive the expected cosmogenic neutrino and gamma ray fluxes from the HiRes data?,"  The High Resolution Fly's Eye Experiment (HiRes) measures cosmic rays (CR) at
the highest energies using the air fluorescence technique. As data taking on
the Dugway Proving Grounds in Western Utah is finished, the HiRes data are
relevant for cosmogenic neutrinos in two different ways. We first use our best
fit to the measured HiRes CR spectrum together with a model of the
extragalactic CR sources to derive the expected cosmogenic neutrino and gamma
ray fluxes at Earth. We then use the HiRes data directly to set competitive
experimental limits on the electron and tau neutrino fluxes at the highest
energies.
"
What are the implications of scalar and sample path large deviation principles for a large class of Poisson cluster processes?,"  In this paper we prove scalar and sample path large deviation principles for
a large class of Poisson cluster processes. As a consequence, we provide a
large deviation principle for ergodic Hawkes point processes.
"
What are the Floer-type theories?,"  In this paper we outline a program for the classification of Floer-type
theories, (or defining invariants of finite type for families). We consider
Khovanov complexes as a local system on the space of knots introduced by V.
Vassiliev and construct the wall-crossing morphism. We extend this system to
the singular locus by the cone of this morphism and introduce the definition of
the local system of finite type. This program can be further generalized to the
manifolds of dimension 3 and 4.
"
What is the relationship between the Entropy Penalized Method and the decay of correlation for a stationary stochastic process?,"  This paper has been withdrawn by the author for further modification.
"
What is the theoretical model for controlled charge pumping in an AlGaAs/GaAs gated nanowire?,"  Controlled charge pumping in an AlGaAs/GaAs gated nanowire by
single-parameter modulation is studied experimentally and theoretically.
Transfer of integral multiples of the elementary charge per modulation cycle is
clearly demonstrated. A simple theoretical model shows that such a quantized
current can be generated via loading and unloading of a dynamic quasi-bound
state. It demonstrates that non-adiabatic blockade of unwanted tunnel events
can obliterate the requirement of having at least two phase-shifted periodic
signals to realize quantized pumping. The simple configuration without multiple
pumping signals might find wide application in metrological experiments and
quantum electronics.
"
What is the experimental study of the quark gluon matter at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC)?,"  I present here a concise review of the experimental results obtained at the
Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC), which shed light on the hot and dense
quark gluon matter produced at these high temperature and density conditions.
"
What is the impact of the one-loop corrections on the kinetic operator contributions to spectral moments?,"  We evaluate the one-loop corrections to the Wilson coefficient of the kinetic
operator in the operator product expansion of the differential B -> X_c l nu
decay rate. With a moderate cut on the lepton energy, the one-loop terms change
the kinetic operator contributions to spectral moments by about 20%. This
amounts to a small correction for leptonic and hadronic moments, except for
those which vanish at the lowest order, where the effect can be sizable.
Together with a two-loop calculation of the leading-power rate and an
evaluation of the one-loop corrections to the Wilson coefficient of the
chromo-magnetic operator, our results will allow for a high-precision
determination of |V_cb| and the b- and c-quark masses.
"
What is the relationship between a particle in a Schwarzschild field and the properties of a zero-spin bosonic field?,"  We find that a field with oscillations of matter in proper time has the
properties of a zero-spin bosonic field. A particle observed in this field is a
proper time oscillator. Neglecting all quantum effects, a proper time
oscillator can mimic a point mass at rest in general relativity. The spacetime
outside a 'stationary' proper time oscillator is a Schwarzschild field.
"
"What is the Shestakov-Umirbaev inequality, and what is its application to tame generators in networks?","  We give a generalization of the Shestakov-Umirbaev inequality which plays an
important role in their solution of the tame generators conjecture.
"
What is the value of the branching ratio?,"  In this work, the radiative Bc -> D*_s gamma decay is investigated in the
framework of QCD sum rules. The transition form factors responsible for the
decay are calculated. The branching ratio for this decay is estimated to be
order of 10^-5 which can be measurable at LHC.
"
What is the most likely cause of the wavelength-dependent variations in the effective radius of the planet?,"  Water is predicted to be among, if not the most abundant molecular species
after hydrogen in the atmospheres of close-in extrasolar giant planets
(hot-Jupiters) Several attempts have been made to detect water on an exoplanet,
but have failed to find compelling evidence for it or led to claims that should
be taken with caution. Here we report an analysis of recent observations of the
hot-Jupiter HD189733b taken during the transit, where the planet passed in
front of its parent star. We find that absorption by water vapour is the most
likely cause of the wavelength-dependent variations in the effective radius of
the planet at the infrared wavelengths 3.6, 5.8 and 8 microns. The larger
effective radius observed at visible wavelengths may be due to either star
variability or the presence of clouds/hazes. We explain the most recent thermal
infrared observations of the planet during secondary transit behind the star,
reporting a non-detection of water on HD189733b, as being a consequence of the
nearly isothermal vertical profile of the planet.s atmosphere. Our results show
that water is detectable on extrasolar planets using the primary transit
technique and that the infrared should be a better wavelength region than the
visible, for such searches.
"
What is the method used to calculate the excitation energies of the Bose-Hubbard model?,"  We consider ultracold bosonic atoms in an optical lattice with an external
trapping potential. To study the excitation energies of the resulting
Bose-Hubbard model, we develop a method based on a time-dependent
generalization of the Gutzwiller ansatz. We calculate the excitations of the
homogeneous system both in insulating and superfluid regime, concentrating
particularly on those near the superfluid-Mott insulator boundary. Low-lying
excitation energies in presence of a static harmonic trap are obtained using
this method and compared with the homogeneous case. Further, we explore the
dynamics of the center of mass and the breathing mode in response to
time-dependent perturbations of the trap.
"
What is the current theoretical understanding of the issue?,"  In this article we address the physical basis of the deviation of hadron
shapes from spherical symmetry (non-spherical amplitudes) with focus on the
nucleon and $\Delta$. An overview of both the experimental methods and results
and the current theoretical understanding of the issue is presented. At the
present time the most quantitative method is the $\gamma^{*} p \to \Delta$
reaction for which significant non-spherical electric (E2) and Coulomb
quadrupole (C2) amplitudes have been observed with good precision as a function
of Q^{2} from the photon point through 6 GeV^{2}. Quark model calculations for
these quadrupole amplitudes are at least an order of magnitude too small and
even have the wrong sign. Lattice QCD, chiral effective field theory, and
dynamic model calculations which include the effects of the pion-cloud are in
approximate agreement with experiment. This is expected due to the spontaneous
breaking of chiral symmetry in QCD and the resulting, long range (low Q^{2})
effects of the pion-cloud. Other observables such as nucleon form factors and
virtual Compton scattering experiments indicate that the pion-cloud is playing
a significant role in nucleon structure. Semi-inclusive deep inelastic
scattering experiments with transverse polarized beam and target also show the
effect of non-zero quark angular momentum.
"
What are the concepts of the Malliavin calculus in semigroup theory?,"  We translate in semigroup theory Bismut's way of the Malliavin calculus.
"
What are the constraints on the surface compactness of a gravastar model?,"  We consider the gravastar model where the vacuum phase transition between the
de Sitter interior and the Schwarzschild or Schwarzschild-de Sitter exterior
geometries takes place at a single spherical delta-shell. We derive sharp
analytic bounds on the surface compactness (2m/r) that follow from the
requirement that the dominant energy condition (DEC) holds at the shell. In the
case of Schwarzschild exterior, the highest surface compactness is achieved
with the stiff shell in the limit of vanishing (dark) energy density in the
interior. In the case of Schwarzschild-de Sitter exterior, in addition to the
gravastar configurations with the shell under surface pressure, gravastar
configurations with vanishing shell pressure (dust shells), as well as
configurations with the shell under surface tension, are allowed by the DEC.
Respective bounds on the surface compactness are derived for all cases. We also
consider the speed of sound on the shell as derived from the requirement that
the shell is stable against the radial perturbations. The causality requirement
(sound speed not exceeding that of light) further restricts the space of
allowed gravastar configurations.
"
What are the implications for the spin wave modes observed in a ferromagnet with finite size?,"  We provide some new results of the ground state of quantum layers.
"
What are the implications of entangling capacities for bipartite unitaries for the Jamiolkowski isomorphism?,"  We show that entangling capacities based on the Jamiolkowski isomorphism may
be used to place lower bounds on the communication capacities of arbitrary
bipartite unitaries. Therefore, for these definitions, the relations which have
been previously shown for two-qubit unitaries also hold for arbitrary
dimensions. These results are closely related to the theory of the
entanglement-assisted capacity of channels. We also present more general
methods for producing ensembles for communication from initial states for
entanglement creation.
"
What are the key concepts in the imaginary-time formulation of the equilibrium quantum many-body theory?,"  We extend the imaginary-time formulation of the equilibrium quantum many-body
theory to steady-state nonequilibrium with an application to strongly
correlated transport. By introducing Matsubara voltage, we keep the finite
chemical potential shifts in the Fermi-Dirac function, in agreement with the
Keldysh formulation. The formulation is applied to strongly correlated
transport in the Kondo regime using the quantum Monte Carlo method.
"
What are the supersymmetric solutions in the N=2 truncation of five-dimensional N=8 gauged supergravity?,"  We construct new supersymmetric solutions, including AdS bubbles, in an N=2
truncation of five-dimensional N=8 gauged supergravity. This particular
truncation is given by N=2 gauged supergravity coupled to two vector multiples
and three incomplete hypermultiplets, and was originally investigated in the
context of obtaining regular AdS bubble geometries with multiple active
R-charges. We focus on cohomogeneity-one solutions corresponding to objects
with two equal angular momenta and up to three independent R-charges.
Curiously, we find a new set of zero and negative mass solitons asymptotic to
AdS_5/Z_k, for k \ge 3, which are everywhere regular without closed timelike
curves.
"
"What are the ratios of branching fractions of the Ds+ decays to K+ eta, pi+ eta', K+ K0S, and pi+ K0S?","  Using data collected near the Ds*+ Ds- peak production energy Ecm = 4170 MeV
by the CLEO-c detector, we study the decays of Ds+ mesons to two pseudoscalar
mesons. We report on searches for the singly-Cabibbo-suppressed Ds+ decay modes
K+ eta, K+ eta', pi+ K0S, K+ pi0, and the isospin-forbidden decay mode Ds+ to
pi+ pi0. We normalize with respect to the Cabibbo-favored Ds+ modes pi+ eta,
pi+ eta', and K+ K0S, and obtain ratios of branching fractions: Ds+ to K+ eta /
Ds+ to pi+ eta = (8.9 +- 1.5 +- 0.4)%, Ds+ to K+ eta' / Ds+ to pi+ eta' = (4.2
+- 1.3 +- 0.3)%, Ds+ to pi+ K0S / Ds+ to K+ K0S = (8.2 +- 0.9 +- 0.2)%, Ds+ to
K+ pi0 / Ds+ to K+ K0S = (5.0 +- 1.2 +- 0.6)%, and Ds+ to pi+ pi0 / Ds+ to K+
K0S < 4.1% at 90% CL, where the uncertainties are statistical and systematic,
respectively.

"What is the goal of the paper ""Formal Solution of the Master Equation via HPT and Deformation Theory""?","  These notes, based on the paper ""Formal Solution of the Master Equation via
HPT and Deformation Theory"" by Huebschmann and Stasheff, were prepared for a
series of talks at Illinois State University with the intention of applying
Homological Perturbation Theory to the derived bracket constructions of
Kosmann-Schwarzbach and T. Voronov, and eventually writing Part II of the paper
""Higher Derived Brackets and Deformation Theory I"" by the present authors.
"
"What is the structure of observable objects in the Universe, according to the author's conclusions?","  The analysis of images (of obtained in various ranges of the lengths of
waves) of luminous objects in the Universe by means of a method of multilevel
dynamic contrasting led author to the conclusions: a) the structures of all
observable galaxies represents a complicated constructions which have the
tendency to self-similarity and made of separate (basic) blocks, which are a
coaxially tubular structures and a cartwheel-like structures; b) the majority
of observable objects in the Universe are luminous butt-ends of almost
invisible (of almost completely transparent) of filamentary formations which
structures are seen only near to their luminous butt-ends; c) the result of
analysis of images of cosmic objects show the structure of many pairs of
cooperating galaxies point to opportunity of their formation at butt-ends
generated in a place of break of the similar filament; d) the interacting
galaxies (M 81 and M 82) show they are butt-ends of sawed off of two branches
of a treelike filament and their interaction is coming out through this
filament; e) as our Universe is in dynamics the processes of formation of
stars, galaxies and their congestions can go presently by means of a fracturing
of filaments with a corresponding diameters and of the time for their such
formation is necessary much less, than along existing standard model.
"
What is the framework for automatically decomposing the functional classes of agents in a complex network?,"  We present a framework for automatically decomposing (""block-modeling"") the
functional classes of agents within a complex network. These classes are
represented by the nodes of an image graph (""block model"") depicting the main
patterns of connectivity and thus functional roles in the network. Using a
first principles approach, we derive a measure for the fit of a network to any
given image graph allowing objective hypothesis testing. From the properties of
an optimal fit, we derive how to find the best fitting image graph directly
from the network and present a criterion to avoid overfitting. The method can
handle both two-mode and one-mode data, directed and undirected as well as
weighted networks and allows for different types of links to be dealt with
simultaneously. It is non-parametric and computationally efficient. The
concepts of structural equivalence and modularity are found as special cases of
our approach. We apply our method to the world trade network and analyze the
roles individual countries play in the global economy.
"
What are the results of the numerical calculations of the kinetic parameters and temperature dependences of the thermally stimulated luminescence and conductivity?,"  Thermally stimulated luminescence (TSL) and conductivity (TSC) are considered
using the classical insulator model that assumes one kind of the active trap,
one kind of inactive deep trap, and one kind of the recombination center.
Kinetic equations describing the model are solved numerically without and with
the use of the quasiequilibrium (QE) approximation. The QE state parameter qI,,
the relative recombination probability g, and a new parameter called
quasi-stationary (QS) state parameter q*=qIg are used for the analysis of the
TSL and TSC. The TSL and TSC curves and the temperature dependences of qI, q*,
g, the recombination lifetime, and the occupancies of active traps and
recombination centers are numerically calculated for five sets of kinetic
parameters and different heating rates. These calculation results show that:
(1) the upper limit of the heating rate for presence of the QS state appears at
higher heating rate than that for the QE state when the retrapping process is
present, and (2) the TSL (TSC) curves in the QS state have the properties
similar to those for the TSL (TSC) curves in the QE state. Approximate formulas
for calculation of the parameters qI and q* in the initial range of the TSL and
TSC curves are derived and used in the heating-rate methods, proposed in this
work, for determination of those parameters from the calculated TSL curves.
"
What is the impact of magnetic fluxes on the brane world volume in large-volume string models with moduli-fixed string compactifications?,"  We study the supersymmetric particle spectra and LHC collider observables for
the large-volume string models with a fundamental scale of 10^{11} GeV that
arise in moduli-fixed string compactifications with branes and fluxes. The
presence of magnetic fluxes on the brane world volume, required for chirality,
perturb the soft terms away from those previously computed in the dilute-flux
limit. We use the difference in high-scale gauge couplings to estimate the
magnitude of this perturbation and study the potential effects of the magnetic
fluxes by generating many random spectra with the soft terms perturbed around
the dilute flux limit. Even with a 40% variation in the high-scale soft terms
the low-energy spectra take a clear and predictive form. The resulting spectra
are broadly similar to those arising on the SPS1a slope, but more degenerate.
In their minimal version the models predict the ratios of gaugino masses to be
M_1 : M_2 : M_3=(1.5 - 2) : 2 : 6, different to both mSUGRA and mirage
mediation. Among the scalars, the squarks tend to be lighter and the sleptons
heavier than for comparable mSUGRA models. We generate 10 fb^{-1} of sample LHC
data for the random spectra in order to study the range of collider
phenomenology that can occur. We perform a detailed mass reconstruction on one
example large-volume string model spectrum. 100 fb^{-1} of integrated
luminosity is sufficient to discriminate the model from mSUGRA and aspects of
the sparticle spectrum can be accurately reconstructed.
"
What are the probabilities associated with the emission and absorption of field quanta that determine the time evolution of the occupation number operators?,"  We study the time evolution of an atom suddenly coupled to a thermal
radiation field. As a simplified model of the atom-electromagnetic field system
we use a system composed by a harmonic oscillator linearly coupled to a scalar
field in the framework of the recently introduced dressed coordinates and
dressed states. We show that the time evolution of the thermal expectation
values for the occupation number operators depend exclusively on the
probabilities associated with the emission and absorption of field quanta. In
particular, the time evolution of the number operator associated with the atom
is given in terms of the probability of remaining in the first excited state
and the decay probabilities from this state by emission of field quanta of
frequencies $\omega_k$. Also, it is showed that independent of the initial
state of the atom, it thermalizes with the thermal radiation field in a time
scale of the order of the inverse coupling constant.
"
What is the effect of critical slowing down on the MSD of tracer particles in colloidal gels?,"  Computer simulations were done of the mean square displacement (MSD) of
tracer particles in colloidal gels formed by diffusion or reaction limited
aggregation of hard spheres. The diffusion coefficient was found to be
determined by the volume fraction accessible to the spherical tracers
($\phi_a$) independent of the gel structure or the tracer size. In all cases,
critical slowing down was observed at $\phi_a\approx 0.03$ and was
characterized by the same scaling laws reported earlier for tracer diffusion in
a Lorentz gas. Strong heterogeneity of the MSD was observed at small $\phi_a$
and was related to the size distribution of pores.
"
What are the results of the comparison of the estimated values of capacitance of a unit square plate with the literature values?,"  A library of C functions yielding exact solutions of potential and flux
influences due to uniform surface distribution of singularities on flat
triangular and rectangular elements has been developed. This library, ISLES,
has been used to develop the neBEM solver that is both precise and fast in
solving a wide range of problems of scientific and technological interest. Here
we present the exact expressions proposed for computing the influence of
uniform singularity distributions on triangular elements and illustrate their
accuracy. We also present a study concerning the time taken to evaluate these
long and complicated expressions \textit{vis a vis} that spent in carrying out
simple quadratures. Finally, we solve a classic benchmark problem in
electrostatics, namely, estimation of the capacitance of a unit square plate
raised to unit volt. For this problem, we present the estimated values of
capacitance and compare them successfully with some of the most accurate
results available in the literature. In addition, we present the variation of
the charge density close to the corner of the plate for various degrees of
discretization. The variations are found to be smooth and converging. This is
in clear contrast to the criticism commonly leveled against usual BEM solvers.
"
What is the concept of symmetric union in a ferromagnet with finite size?,"  Motivated by the study of ribbon knots we explore symmetric unions, a
beautiful construction introduced by Kinoshita and Terasaka 50 years ago. It is
easy to see that every symmetric union represents a ribbon knot, but the
converse is still an open problem. Besides existence it is natural to consider
the question of uniqueness. In order to attack this question we extend the
usual Reidemeister moves to a family of moves respecting the symmetry, and
consider the symmetric equivalence thus generated. This notion being in place,
we discuss several situations in which a knot can have essentially distinct
symmetric union representations. We exhibit an infinite family of ribbon
two-bridge knots each of which allows two different symmetric union
representations.
"
What are the implications of clump clusters for galaxy evolution in the early universe?,"  Many galaxies at high redshift have peculiar morphologies dominated by
10^8-10^9 Mo kpc-sized clumps. Using numerical simulations, we show that these
""clump clusters"" can result from fragmentation in gravitationally unstable
primordial disks. They appear as ""chain galaxies"" when observed edge-on. In
less than 1 Gyr, clump formation, migration, disruption, and interaction with
the disk cause these systems to evolve from initially uniform disks into
regular spiral galaxies with an exponential or double-exponential disk profile
and a central bulge. The inner exponential is the initial disk size and the
outer exponential is from material flung out by spiral arms and clump torques.
A nuclear black hole may form at the same time as the bulge from smaller black
holes that grow inside the dense cores of each clump. The properties and
lifetimes of the clumps in our models are consistent with observations of the
clumps in high redshift galaxies, and the stellar motions in our models are
consistent with the observed velocity dispersions and lack of organized
rotation in chain galaxies. We suggest that violently unstable disks are the
first step in spiral galaxy formation. The associated starburst activity gives
a short timescale for the initial stellar disk to form.
"
How are elliptic curves with complex multiplication by any imaginary quadratic field modeled using a general formula?,"  We give explicit formulas for the number of points on reductions of elliptic
curves with complex multiplication by any imaginary quadratic field. We also
find models for CM $\mathbf{Q}$-curves in certain cases. This generalizes
earlier results of Gross, Stark, and others.
"
What are the challenges of the existing algorithms for generating randomized network ensembles?,"  Transcription networks, and other directed networks can be characterized by
some topological observables such as for example subgraph occurrence (network
motifs). In order to perform such kind of analysis, it is necessary to be able
to generate suitable randomized network ensembles. Typically, one considers
null networks with the same degree sequences of the original ones. The commonly
used algorithms sometimes have long convergence times, and sampling problems.
We present here an alternative, based on a variant of the importance sampling
Montecarlo developed by Chen et al. [1].
"
What is the conformal Killing-Yano tensor for the Plebanski-Demianski family of type D solutions?,"  We present the explicit expressions for the conformal Killing-Yano tensors
for the Plebanski-Demianski family of type D solutions in four dimensions. Some
physically important special cases are discussed in more detail. In particular,
it is demonstrated how the conformal Killing-Yano tensor becomes the
Killing-Yano tensor for the solutions without acceleration. A possible
generalization into higher dimensions is studied. Whereas the transition from
the nonaccelerating to accelerating solutions in four dimensions is achieved by
the conformal rescaling of the metric, we show that such a procedure is not
sufficiently general in higher dimensions - only the maximally symmetric
spacetimes in 'accelerated' coordinates are obtained.
"
How do quark loops affect the scaling violations observed in some unquenched studies?,"  The effects of unquenching on the perturbative improvement coefficients in
the Symanzik action are computed within the framework of L\""uscher-Weisz
on-shell improvement. We find that the effects of quark loops are surprisingly
large, and their omission may well explain the scaling violations observed in
some unquenched studies.
"
What are the domain $G$ independent of the domain $G$?,"  We prove that the abscissas of Bohr and Rogosinski for ordinary Dirichlet
series, mapping the right half-plane into the bounded convex domain $G\subset
\mathbb{C} $ are independent of the domain $G$. Furthermore, we obtain new
estimates about these abscissas.
"
What is the role of amplitudes in a game on a finite simple graph?,"  The numbers game is a one-player game played on a finite simple graph with
certain ``amplitudes'' assigned to its edges and with an initial assignment of
real numbers to its nodes. The moves of the game successively transform the
numbers at the nodes using the amplitudes in a certain way. This game and its
interactions with Coxeter/Weyl group theory and Lie theory have been studied by
many authors. Following Eriksson, we allow the amplitudes on graph edges to be
certain real numbers. Games played on such graphs are ``E-games.'' We show that
for certain such three-node cyclic graphs, any numbers game will diverge when
played from an initial assignment of nonnegative real numbers not all zero.
This result is a key step in a Dynkin diagram classification (obtained
elsewhere) of all E-game graphs which meet a certain finiteness requirement.
"
How does the nonlinear resonant coupling of the cluster electrons with the laser field affect the harmonic emission?,"  The harmonic emission from cluster nanoplasmas subject to short, intense
infrared laser pulses is analyzed by means of particle-in-cell simulations. A
pronounced resonant enhancement of the low-order harmonic yields is found when
the Mie plasma frequency of the ionizing and expanding cluster resonates with
the respective harmonic frequency. We show that a strong, nonlinear resonant
coupling of the cluster electrons with the laser field inhibits coherent
electron motion, suppressing the emitted radiation and restricting the spectrum
to only low-order harmonics. A pump-probe scheme is suggested to monitor the
ionization dynamics of the expanding clusters.
"
What are the neutrino masses in the model of neutrino masses to realize leptogenesis and dark matter at the TeV scale?,"  We propose an interesting model of neutrino masses to realize leptogenesis
and dark matter at the TeV scale. A real scalar is introduced to naturally
realize the Majorana masses of the right-handed neutrinos. We also include a
new Higgs doublet that contributes to the dark matter of the universe. The
neutrino masses come from the vacuum expectation value of the triplet Higgs
scalar. The right-handed neutrinos are not constrained by the neutrino masses
and hence they could generate leptogenesis at the TeV scale without subscribing
to resonant leptogenesis. In our model, all new particles could be observable
at the forthcoming Large Hardon Collider or the proposed future International
Linear Collider.
"
What is the possibility of realizing transport-current driven pseudospin-transfer oscillators in semiconductors?,"  The pseudospin degree of freedom in a semiconductor bilayer gives rise to a
collective mode analogous to the ferromagnetic resonance mode of a ferromagnet.
We present a theory of the dependence of the energy and the damping of this
mode on layer separation $d$. Based on these results, we discuss the
possibility of realizing transport-current driven pseudospin-transfer
oscillators in semiconductors.
"
What is the analytic approach to phenomenological models inspired by cubic string field theory?,"  An analytic approach to phenomenological models inspired by cubic string
field theory is introduced and applied to some examples. We study a class of
actions for a minimally coupled, homogeneous scalar field whose energy density
contains infinitely many time derivatives. These nonlocal systems are
systematically localized and an algorithm to find cosmological solutions of the
dynamical equations is provided. Our formalism is able to define the nonlocal
field in regions of the parameter space which are inaccessible by standard
methods. Also, problems related to nonlocality are reinterpreted under a novel
perspective and naturally overcome. We consider phenomenological models living
on a Friedmann-Robertson-Walker background with power-law scale factor, both in
four dimensions and on a high-energy braneworld. The quest for solutions
unravels general features of nonlocal dynamics indicating several future
directions of investigation.
"
What are the conditions for a semigroup to satisfy the open set condition?,"  We consider the dynamics of expanding semigroups generated by finitely many
rational maps on the Riemann sphere. We show that for an analytic family of
such semigroups, the Bowen parameter function is real-analytic and
plurisubharmonic. Combining this with a result obtained by the first author, we
show that if for each semigroup of such an analytic family of expanding
semigroups satisfies the open set condition, then the function of the Hausdorff
dimension of the Julia set is real-analytic and plurisubharmonic. Moreover, we
provide an extensive collection of classes of examples of analytic families of
semigroups satisfying all the above conditions and we analyze in detail the
corresponding Bowen's parameters and Hausdorff dimension function.
"
What are the implications of the degeneracy distribution of the black hole horizon area eigenstates for the black hole radiation spectrum?,"  Recent detailed analysis within the Loop Quantum Gravity calculation of black
hole entropy shows a stair-like structure in the behavior of entropy as a
function of horizon area. The non-trivial distribution of the degeneracy of the
black hole horizon area eigenstates is at the origin of this behavior. This
degeneracy distribution is analyzed and a phenomenological model is put forward
to study the implications of this distribution in the black hole radiation
spectrum. Some qualitative quantum effects are obtained within the isolated
horizon framework. This result provides us with a possible observational test
of this model for quantum black holes.
"
What is the relationship between the moment operators and the observable in the balanced homodyne detection?,"  We consider the moment operators of the observable (i.e. a semispectral
measure or POM) associated with the balanced homodyne detection statistics,
with paying attention to the correct domains of these unbounded operators. We
show that the high amplitude limit, when performed on the moment operators,
actually determines uniquely the entire statistics of a rotated quadrature
amplitude of the signal field, thereby verifying the usual assumption that the
homodyne detection achieves a measurement of that observable. We also consider,
in a general setting, the possibility of constructing a measurement of a single
quantum observable from a sequence of observables by taking the limit on the
level of moment operators of these observables. In this context, we show that
under some natural conditions (each of which is satisfied by the homodyne
detector example), the existence of the moment limits ensures that the
underlying probability measures converge weakly to the probability measure of
the limiting observable. The moment approach naturally requires that the
observables be determined by their moment operator sequences (which does not
automatically happen), and it turns out, in particular, that this is the case
for the balanced homodyne detector.
"
What are the expected scaling regimes for a polymer in a good solvent as the number of monomers (N) increases?,"  Force induced stretching of polymers is important in a variety of contexts.
We have used theory and simulations to describe the response of homopolymers,
with $N$ monomers, to force ($f$) in good and poor solvents. In good solvents
and for {{sufficiently large}} $N$ we show, in accord with scaling predictions,
that the mean extension along the $f$ axis $<Z>\sim f$ for small $f$, and
$<Z>\sim f^{{2/3}}$ (the Pincus regime) for intermediate values of $f$. The
theoretical predictions for $\la Z\ra$ as a function of $f$ are in excellent
agreement with simulations for N=100 and 1600. However, even with N=1600, the
expected Pincus regime is not observed due to the the breakdown of the
assumptions in the blob picture for finite $N$. {{We predict the Pincus scaling
in a good solvent will be observed for $N\gtrsim 10^5$}}. The force-dependent
structure factors for a polymer in a poor solvent show that there are a
hierarchy of structures, depending on the nature of the solvent. For a weakly
hydrophobic polymer, various structures (ideal conformations, self-avoiding
chains, globules, and rods) emerge on distinct length scales as $f$ is varied.
A strongly hydrophobic polymer remains globular as long as $f$ is less than a
critical value $f_c$. Above $f_c$, an abrupt first order transition to a
rod-like structure occurs. Our predictions can be tested using single molecule
experiments.
"
What is the geometrical effect of breaking the superconformal boost symmetry of the $\theta$-twistor superspace?,"  We generalize the idea of supertwistors and introduce a new supersymmetric
object - the $\theta$-twistor which includes the composite Ramond vector [11]
well known from the spinning string dynamics. The symmetries of the chiral
$\theta$-twistor superspace are studied. It is shown that the chiral spin
structure introduced by the $\theta$-twistor breaks the superconformal boost
symmetry but preserves the scale symmetry and the super-Poincare symmetry. This
geometrical effect of breaking correlates with the Gross-Wess effect of the
conformal boost breaking for bosonic scattering amplitudes.
"
What is the algebraic approach to Arakelov geometry?,"  This work is dedicated to a new completely algebraic approach to Arakelov
geometry, which doesn't require the variety under consideration to be
generically smooth or projective. In order to construct such an approach we
develop a theory of generalized rings and schemes, which include classical
rings and schemes together with ""exotic"" objects such as F_1 (""field with one
element""), Z_\infty (""real integers""), T (tropical numbers) etc., thus
providing a systematic way of studying such objects.
  This theory of generalized rings and schemes is developed up to construction
of algebraic K-theory, intersection theory and Chern classes. Then existence of
Arakelov models of algebraic varieties over Q is shown, and our general results
are applied to such models.
"
What are the disjoint intervals of the order statistics given in terms of the two distribution functions?,"  Consider a set of order statistics that arise from sorting samples from two
different populations, each with their own, possibly different distribution
function. The probability that these order statistics fall in disjoint, ordered
intervals, and that of the smallest statistics, a certain number come from the
first populations, are given in terms of the two distribution functions. The
result is applied to computing the joint probability of the number of
rejections and the number of false rejections for the Benjamini-Hochberg false
discovery rate procedure.
"
What are the critical points of a scalar quantity in a two-dimensional homogeneous and isotropic random field?,"  Critical points of a scalar quantitiy are either extremal points or saddle
points. The character of the critical points is determined by the sign
distribution of the eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix. For a two-dimensional
homogeneous and isotropic random function topological arguments are sufficient
to show that all possible sign combinations are equidistributed or with other
words, the density of the saddle points and extrema agree. This argument breaks
down in three dimensions. All ratios of the densities of saddle points and
extrema larger than one are possible. For a homogeneous Gaussian random field
one finds no longer an equidistribution of signs, saddle points are slightly
more frequent.
"
What is the conductance G of a bipolar junction in a graphene nanoribbon?,"  We calculate the conductance G of a bipolar junction in a graphene
nanoribbon, in the high-magnetic field regime where the Hall conductance in the
p-doped and n-doped regions is 2e^2/h. In the absence of intervalley
scattering, the result G=(e^2/h)(1-cos Phi) depends only on the angle Phi
between the valley isospins (= Bloch vectors representing the spinor of the
valley polarization) at the two opposite edges. This plateau in the conductance
versus Fermi energy is insensitive to electrostatic disorder, while it is
destabilized by the dispersionless edge state which may exist at a zigzag
boundary. A strain-induced vector potential shifts the conductance plateau up
or down by rotating the valley isospin.
"
What is the relationship between the Lagrangian and Eulerian spaces?,"  On the basis of gauge principle in the field theory, a new variational
formulation is presented for flows of an ideal fluid. The fluid is defined
thermodynamically by mass density and entropy density, and its flow fields are
characterized by symmetries of translation and rotation. A structure of
rotation symmetry is equipped with a Lagrangian $\Lambda_A$ including
vorticity, in addition to Lagrangians of translation symmetry. From the action
principle, Euler's equation of motion is derived. In addition, the equations of
continuity and entropy are derived from the variations. Equations of conserved
currents are deduced as the Noether theorem in the space of Lagrangian
coordinate $\ba$. It is shown that, with the translation symmetry alone, there
is freedom in the transformation between the Lagrangian $\ba$-space and
Eulerian $\bx$-space. The Lagrangian $\Lambda_A$ provides non-trivial topology
of vorticity field and yields a source term of the helicity. The vorticity
equation is derived as an equation of the gauge field. Present formulation
provides a basis on which the transformation between the $\ba$ space and the
$\bx$ space is determined uniquely.
"
What is the QKD protocol that enables three parties to agree at once on a shared common random bit string?,"  We propose a quantum key distribution (QKD) protocol that enables three
parties agree at once on a shared common random bit string in presence of an
eavesdropper without use of entanglement. We prove its unconditional security
and analyze the key rate.
"
What are the temperature-dependent conductance and thermopower in the first quantization plateau?,"  We consider interaction effects in quantum point contacts on the first
quantization plateau, taking into account all non momentum-conserving
processes. We compute low-temperature linear and non-linear conductance, shot
noise, and thermopower by perturbation theory, and show that they are
consistent with experimental observations on the so-called ""0.7 anomaly"". The
full temperature-dependent conductance is obtained from self-consistent
second-order perturbation theory and approaches ~ e^2/h at higher temperatures,
but still smaller than the Fermi temperature.
"
What are the assumptions in the paper that are contradicted by factual truth?,"  Recently, Engel et al. discussed phonon broadening as observed in 3D
quasicrystals on the basis of calculations on the Fibonacci chain. We show that
the paper contains several statements and assumptions that are contradicted by
factual truth.
"
What are the two ways to define a symplectic group action?,"  For symplectic group actions which are not Hamiltonian there are two ways to
define reduction. Firstly using the cylinder-valued momentum map and secondly
lifting the action to any Hamiltonian cover (such as the universal cover), and
then performing symplectic reduction in the usual way. We show that provided
the action is free and proper, and the Hamiltonian holonomy associated to the
action is closed, the natural projection from the latter to the former is a
symplectic cover. At the same time we give a classification of all Hamiltonian
covers of a given symplectic group action. The main properties of the lifting
of a group action to a cover are studied.
"
What are the characteristics of Bose fluids above their superfluid Tcs?,"  This paper emphasizes that non-linear rotational or diamagnetic
susceptibility is characteristic of Bose fluids above their superfluid Tcs, and
for sufficiently slow rotation or weak B-fields amounts to an incompressible
response to vorticity. The cause is a missing term in the conventionally
accepted model Hamiltonian for quantized vortices in the Bose fluid. The
resulting susceptibility can account for recent observations of Chan et al on
solid He, and Ong et al on cuprate superconductors.
"
What is the relationship between the autonomous dynamics of a slow and a fast subsystem in a Hamiltonian system?,"  Consider a Hamiltonian system that consists of a slow subsystem S and a fast
subsystem F. The autonomous dynamics of S is driven by an effective
Hamiltonian, but its thermodynamics is unexpected. We show that a well-defined
thermodynamic arrow of time (second law) emerges for S whenever there is a
well-defined causal arrow from S to F and the back-action is negligible. This
is because the back-action of F on S is described by a non-globally Hamiltonian
Born-Oppenheimer term that violates the Liouville theorem, and makes the second
law inapplicable to S. If S and F are mixing, under the causal arrow condition
they are described by microcanonic distributions P(S) and P(S|F). Their
structure supports a causal inference principle proposed recently in machine
learning.
"
What is the variational procedure for the minimization of distribution networks?,"  A model is proposed to minimize the total volume of the main distribution
networks of fluids in relation to the organ form. The minimization analysis
shows that the overall exterior form of distribution networks is a modified
ellipsoid, a geometric form that is a good approximation to the external
anatomy of the kidney and lung. The variational procedure implementing this
minimization is similar to the traditional isoperimetric theorems of geometry.
  A revised version of this preprint that expands Section 4 will be published
in the Journal of Biological Systems, World Scientific Publishing.
"
What are the energy barriers for in-layer diffusion and step crossing in a PTCDA molecule?,"  The step edge barrier of a prototypical organic semiconductor molecule,
3,4,9,10-perylene-tetracaboxylic-dianhydride (PTCDA) has been analysed by means
of calculations based on emperical potentials. The minimum energy path (MEP)
has been calculated for a single molecule on a substrate of three molecular
layers between equivalent minimum energy positions within two neighboring unit
cells. To determine the step edge barrier, we have calculated the MEP over a
step to a fourth layer of molecules. We found energy barriers of E_D= 80 meV
for in-layer diffusion and E_S = 750 meV for step crossing, indicating a strong
Ehrlich-Schwoebel effect for PTCDA.
"
What are the features in the phase diagram and the spectral properties of the model?,"  We discuss the fixed-point Hamiltonian and the spectrum of excitations of a
quasi-bidimensional electronic system supporting simultaneously
antiferromamagnetic ordering and superconductivity. The coexistence of these
two order parameters in a single phase is possible because the magnetic order
is linked to the formation of a spin density wave, and its order parameter is
not associated to a spectral gap but to an energy shift of the paramagnetic
bands. This peculiarity entails several distinct features in the phase diagram
and the spectral properties of the model, which may have been observed in
CeRhIn$_5$. Apart from the coexistence, we find an abrupt suppression of the
spin density wave when the superconducting and magnetic ordering temperatures
are equal. The divergence of the cyclotron mass extracted from de Haas-van
Alphen experiments is also analyzed in the same framework.
"
"What is the N=1 SU(N_c) x SU(N_c') gauge theory, and what is the N=1 SU(N_c) x SO(N_c') gauge theory?","  Starting from the N=1 SU(N_c) x SU(N_c') gauge theory with fundamental and
bifundamental flavors, we apply the Seiberg dual to the first gauge group and
obtain the N=1 dual gauge theory with dual matters including the gauge
singlets. By analyzing the F-term equations of the superpotential, we describe
the intersecting type IIA brane configuration for the meta-stable
nonsupersymmetric vacua of this gauge theory. By introducing an orientifold
6-plane, we generalize to the case for N=1 SU(N_c) x SO(N_c') gauge theory with
fundamental and bifundamental flavors. Finally, the N=1 SU(N_c) x Sp(N_c')
gauge theory with matters is also described very briefly.
"
What is the bounce solution in a brane world setup?,"  We analyze vacuum decay in brane world setups, where a free scalar field in
five dimensions has a localized potential admitting metastable vacua. We study
in particular the bounce solution and its properties in flat and warped spaces.
In the latter case, placing into a deeply warped region the term in the
potential that lifts the vacuum degeneracy, can increase indefinitely the
lifetime of the false vacuum. We discuss the application to metastable vacua in
supersymmetric brane-world constructions.
"
What is the DFS used to encode logical qubits in a coherent manner?,"  We demonstrate coherent control of two logical qubits encoded in a
decoherence free subspace (DFS) of four dipolar-coupled protons in an NMR
quantum information processor. A pseudo-pure fiducial state is created in the
DFS, and a unitary logical qubit entangling operator evolves the system to a
logical Bell state. The four-spin molecule is partially aligned by a liquid
crystal solvent, which introduces strong dipolar couplings among the spins.
Although the system Hamiltonian is never fully specified, we demonstrate high
fidelity control over the logical degrees of freedom. In fact, the DFS encoding
leads to higher fidelity control than is available in the full four-spin
Hilbert space.
"
What are the key factors influencing the shape of the excluded-volume borderline in the E2A model?,"  We present a model improving the two-angle model for interphase chromatin
(E2A model). This model takes into account the cylindrical shape of the histone
octamers, the H1 histones in front of the nucleosomes and the vertical distance
$d$ between the in and outgoing DNA strands. Factoring these chromatin features
in, one gets essential changes in the chromatin phase diagram: Not only the
shape of the excluded-volume borderline changes but also the vertical distance
$d$ has a dramatic influence on the forbidden area. Furthermore, we examined
the influence of H1 defects on the properties of the chromatin fiber. Thus we
present two possible strategies for chromatin compaction: The use of very dense
states in the phase diagram in the gaps in the excluded volume borderline or
missing H1 histones which can lead to very compact fibers. The chromatin fiber
might use both of these mechanisms to compact itself at least locally. Line
densities computed within the model coincident with the experimental values.
"
What are the limiting factors in the dynamical behavior of complex systems?,"  The identification of the limiting factors in the dynamical behavior of
complex systems is an important interdisciplinary problem which often can be
traced to the spectral properties of an underlying network. By deriving a
general relation between the eigenvalues of weighted and unweighted networks,
here I show that for a wide class of networks the dynamical behavior is tightly
bounded by few network parameters. This result provides rigorous conditions for
the design of networks with predefined dynamical properties and for the
structural control of physical processes in complex systems. The results are
illustrated using synchronization phenomena as a model process.
"
What is the Bethe ansatz used to derive the S-matrix for strings in AdS5 x S5?,"  We use the coordinate Bethe ansatz approach to derive the nested Bethe
equations corresponding to the recently found S-matrix for strings in AdS5 x
S5, compatible with centrally extended su(2|2) symmetry.
"
What is the mass of dark matter particles in the Hennawi/Ostriker analysis?,"  Kelso, Hooper and Buckley [arXiv:1110.5338] found CRESST, CoGeNT and
DAMA/LIBRA results are consistent with 10 - 15 GeV dark matter particles.
Hennawi and Ostriker [arXiv:astro-ph/0108203] analyzed supermassive black hole
formation in the centers of galaxies, finding a best fit for dark matter
(self-interaction cross-section)/mass ratio = 0.02 cm^{2}/g, with round-off
error of 25%. Combining the Hennawi/Ostriker result with the ""strong gravity""
model for dark matter [arXiv:0706.3050] requires dark matter particles with
mass between 10.5 GeV and 17.5 GeV, overlapping the Kelso/Hooper/Buckley dark
matter particle mass range.
"
What is the relationship between the Kuramoto paradigm and an electrical power distribution grid of generators and consumers?,"  We show that there is a link between the Kuramoto paradigm and another system
of synchronized oscillators, namely an electrical power distribution grid of
generators and consumers. The purpose of this work is to show both the formal
analogy and some practical consequences. The mapping can be made quantitative,
and under some necessary approximations a class of Kuramoto-like models, those
with bimodal distribution of the frequencies, is most appropriate for the
power-grid. In fact in the power-grid there are two kinds of oscillators: the
'sources' delivering power to the 'consumers'.
"
How do the pixel Colour Magnitude Diagrams (pCMDs) vary according to galaxy type?,"  We present a study of pixel Colour Magnitude Diagrams (pCMDs) for a sample of
69 nearby galaxies chosen to span a wide range of Hubble types. Our goal is to
determine how useful a pixel approach is for studying galaxies according to
their stellar light distributions and content. The galaxy images were analysed
on a pixel-by-pixel basis to reveal the structure of the individual pCMDs. We
find that the average surface brightness (or projected mass density) in each
pixel varies according to galaxy type. Early-type galaxies exihibit a clear
``prime sequence'' and some pCMDs of face-on spirals reveal ``inverse-L''
structures. We find that the colour dispersion at a given magnitude is found to
be approximately constant in early-type galaxies but this quantity varies in
the mid and late-types. We investigate individual galaxies and find that the
pCMDs can be used to pick out morphological features. We discuss the discovery
of ``Red Hooks'' in the pCMDs of six early-type galaxies and two spirals and
postulate their origins. We develop quantitative methods to characterise the
pCMDs, including measures of the blue-to-red light ratio and colour
distributions of each galaxy and we organise these by morphological type. We
compare the colours of the pixels in each galaxy with the stellar population
models of Bruzual & Charlot (2003) to calculate star formation histories for
each galaxy type and compare these to the stellar mass within each pixel. Maps
of pixel stellar mass and mass-to-light ratio are compared to galaxy images. We
apply the pCMD technique to three galaxies in the Hubble Ultra Deep Field to
test the usefulness of the analysis at high redshift. We propose that these
results can be used as part of a new system of automated classification of
galaxies that can be applied at high redshift.
"
How is the Coulomb force between the transmission line and the beam determined in the microwave on the transmission line and the displacement of the beam?,"  We study a method to cool down the vibration mode of a micro-mechanical beam
using a capacitively-coupled superconducting transmission line. The Coulomb
force between the transmission line and the beam is determined by the driving
microwave on the transmission line and the displacement of the beam. When the
frequency of the driving microwave is smaller than that of the transmission
line resonator, the Coulomb force can oppose the velocity of the beam. Thus,
the beam can be cooled. This mechanism, which may enable to prepare the beam in
its quantum ground state of vibration, is feasible under current experimental
conditions.
"
What is the relationship between the boundary plane in the 3D conductance space and the neuron's dynamical system?,"  Recent in vitro data show that neurons respond to input variance with varying
sensitivities. Here, we demonstrate that Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) neurons can
operate in two computational regimes, one that is more sensitive to input
variance (differentiating) and one that is less sensitive (integrating). A
boundary plane in the 3D conductance space separates these two regimes. For a
reduced HH model, this plane can be derived analytically from the V nullcline,
thus suggesting a means of relating biophysical parameters to neural
computation by analyzing the neuron's dynamical system.
"
What is the relationship between the Kodaira dimension and the Betti number of the canonical covering of F?,"  We show that the M-canonical map of an n-dimensional complex projective
manifold X of Kodaira dimension two is birational to an Iitaka fibration for a
computable positive integer M. M depends on the index b of a general fibre F of
the Iitaka fibration and on the Betti number of the canonical covering of F, In
particular, M is a universal constant if the dimension n is smaller than or
equal to 4.
"
What are the implications of the Bell inequalities for the existence of entangled states in a bipartite graph?,"  We show that positivity of {\it every} partial transpose of $N$-partite
quantum states implies new inequalities on Bell correlations which are stronger
than standard Bell inequalities by a factor of $2^{(N-1)/2}$. A violation of
the inequality implies the system is in a bipartite distillable entangled
state. It turns out that a family of $N$-qubit bound entangled states proposed
by D\""ur {[Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 87}, 230402 (2001)]} violates the inequality
for $N\geq 4$.
"
What are the propagator effects of the unparticle through the Drell-Yan tree level process?,"  Phenomenology of the notion of an unparticle U, recently perceived by Georgi,
to describe a scale invariant sector with a non-trivial infrared fixed point at
a higher energy scale is explored in details. Behaving like a collection of d_U
(the scale dimension of the unparticle operator O_U) invisible massless
particles, this unparticle can be unveiled by measurements of various energy
distributions for the processes Z to fermion pair + U and e-e+ to gamma U at
e-e+ colliders, as well as mono-jet production at hadron colliders. We also
study the propagator effects of the unparticle through the Drell-Yan tree level
process and the one-loop muon anomaly.
"
What is the shape of the average HI profile beyond the terminal velocity?,"  We use atomic hydrogen (HI) data from the Southern Galactic Plane Survey to
study the kinematics of the fourth quadrant of the Milky Way. By measuring the
terminal velocity as a function of longitude throughout the fourth Galactic
quadrant we have derived the most densely sampled rotation curve available for
the Milky Way between 3 < R < 8 kpc. We determine a new joint rotation curve
fit for the first and fourth quadrants, which can be used for kinematic
distances interior to the Solar circle. From our data we place new limits on
the peak to peak variation of streaming motions in the fourth quadrant to be
~10 km/s. We show that the shape of the average HI profile beyond the terminal
velocity is consistent with gas of three velocity dispersions, a cold component
with $\Delta v=6.3$ km/s, a warmer component with $\Delta v=12.3$ km/s and a
fast component with $\Delta v=25.9$ km/s. Examining the widths with Galactic
radius we find that the narrowest two components show little variation with
radius and their small scale fluctuations track each other very well,
suggesting that they share the same cloud-to-cloud motions. The width of the
widest component is constant until R<4 kpc, where it increases sharply.
"
What is the method of differential equations used to evaluate D-dimensionally regulated Feynman integrals?,"  We review in a pedagogical way the method of differential equations for the
evaluation of D-dimensionally regulated Feynman integrals. After dealing with
the general features of the technique, we discuss its application in the
context of one- and two-loop corrections to the photon propagator in QED, by
computing the Vacuum Polarization tensor exactly in D. Finally, we treat two
cases of less trivial differential equations, respectively associated to a
two-loop three-point, and a four-loop two-point integral. These two examples
are the playgrounds for showing more technical aspects about: Laurent expansion
of the differential equations in D (around D=4); the choice of the boundary
conditions; and the link among differential and difference equations for
Feynman integrals.
"
What are the relations between interaction constants in the model and experimental quantities?,"  An exactly solvable effective model is suggested for an asymmetric spin
ladder with dimerized rungs. Magnon mode truncation originated from magnon
decay (recently observed in the 1D compound ${\rm IPA-CuCl}_3$) is naturally
described within this model. Using Bethe Ansatze we described a one-magnon
sector and obtained relations between interaction constants of the model and
experimentally observable quantities such as the gap and truncation energies,
spin velocity and the truncation wave vector. It is also shown that structure
factor turns to zero at the truncation point.

What is the diagonal two-point correlation function of the square lattice Ising model?,"  In 1980 Jimbo and Miwa evaluated the diagonal two-point correlation function
of the square lattice Ising model as a $\tau$-function of the sixth Painlev\'e
system by constructing an associated isomonodromic system within their theory
of holonomic quantum fields. More recently an alternative isomonodromy theory
was constructed based on bi-orthogonal polynomials on the unit circle with
regular semi-classical weights, for which the diagonal Ising correlations arise
as the leading coefficient of the polynomials specialised appropriately. Here
we demonstrate that the next-to-diagonal correlations of the anisotropic Ising
model are evaluated as one of the elements of this isomonodromic system or
essentially as the Cauchy-Hilbert transform of one of the bi-orthogonal
polynomials.
"
What is the Curie temperature of the as-grown films in GaMnP?,"  We report the successful passivation of the Mn acceptors in GaMnP upon
exposure to a remote dc hydrogen plasma. The as-grown films are non-metallic
and ferromagnetic with a Curie temperature of T_C=55K. After hydrogenation the
sample resistivity increases by approximately three orders of magnitude at room
temperature and six orders of magnitude at 25 K. Furthermore, the hydrogenated
samples are paramagnetic, which is evidenced by a magnetization curve at 5 K
that is best described by a Brillouin function with g=2 and J=5/2 expected for
Mn atoms in the 3d^5 configuration. These observations unambiguously proof that
the ferromagnetism is carrier-mediated also in GaMnP.
"
What are the main dynamical effects that influence the fusion cross sections?,"  We study fusion reactions of the $^{64}$Ni+$^{132}$Sn system using the
recently introduced density constrained time-dependent Hartree-Fock formalism.
In this formalism the fusion barriers are directly obtained from TDHF dynamics.
In addition, we incorporate the entrance channel alignment of the deformed
(oblate) $^{64}$Ni nucleus due to dynamical Coulomb excitation. We discuss the
influence of particle transfer and other dynamical effects on the fusion cross
sections. Calculated cross sections are in very good agreement with data and
other calculations.
"
Can geodesics confined to the axis of rotation behave like a particle in a potential well?,"  In this paper, the equations of motion for geodesics in the neutral rotating
Black Ring metric are derived and the separability of these equations is
considered. The bulk of the paper is concerned with sets of solutions where the
geodesic equations can be examined analytically - specifically geodesics
confined to the axis of rotation, geodesics restricted to the equatorial plane,
and geodesics that circle through the centre of the ring. The geodesics on the
rotational axis behave like a particle in a potential well, while the geodesics
confined to the equatorial plane mimic those of the Schwarzschild metric. It is
shown that it is impossible to have circular orbits that pass through the ring,
but some numerical results are presented which suggest that it is possible to
have bound orbits that circle through the ring.
"
What is the underlying algebraic structure of the complex associated with a link in Khovanov's link homology theory?,"  We explore the complex associated to a link in the geometric formalism of
Khovanov's (n=2) link homology theory, determine its exact underlying algebraic
structure and find its precise universality properties for link homology
functors. We present new methods of extracting all known link homology theories
directly from this universal complex, and determine its relative strength as a
link invariant by specifying the amount of information held within the complex.
  We achieve these goals by finding a complex isomorphism which reduces the
complex into one in a simpler category. We introduce few tools and methods,
including surface classification modulo the 4TU/S/T relations and genus
generating operators, and use them to explore the relation between the
geometric complex and its underlying algebraic structure. We identify the
universal topological quantum field theory (TQFT) that can be used to create
link homology and find that it is ``smaller'' than what was previously reported
by Khovanov. We find new homology theories that hold a controlled amount of
information relative to the known ones.
  The universal complex is computable efficiently using our reduction theorem.
This allows us to explore the phenomenological aspects of link homology theory
through the eyes of the universal complex in order to explain and unify various
phenomena (such as torsion and thickness). The universal theory also enables us
to state results regarding specific link homology theories derived from it. The
methods developed in this thesis can be combined with other known techniques
(such as link homology spectral sequences) or used in the various extensions of
Khovanov link homology (such as sl_3 link homology).
"
What are the implications of the boost generator in the algebra of the kinematics?,"  It was recently noted that the dispersion relation for the magnons of planar
N=4 SYM can be identified with the Casimir of a certain deformation of the
Poincare algebra, in which the energy and momentum operators are supplemented
by a boost generator J. By considering the relationship between J and su(2|2) x
R^2, we derive a q-deformed super-Poincare symmetry algebra of the kinematics.
Using this, we show that the dynamic magnon representations may be obtained by
boosting from a fixed rest-frame representation. We comment on aspects of the
coalgebra structure and some implications for the question of boost-covariance
of the S-matrix.
"
What are the implications of nonlinear and redshift-space distortion effects on the BAO scale?,"  An acoustic oscillation of the primeval photon-baryon fluid around the
decoupling time imprints a characteristic scale in the galaxy distribution
today, known as the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) scale. Several on-going
and/or future galaxy surveys aim at detecting and precisely determining the BAO
scale so as to trace the expansion history of the universe. We consider
nonlinear and redshift-space distortion effects on the shifts of the BAO scale
in $k$-space using perturbation theory. The resulting shifts are indeed
sensitive to different choices of the definition of the BAO scale, which needs
to be kept in mind in the data analysis. We present a toy model to explain the
physical behavior of the shifts. We find that the BAO scale defined as in
Percival et al. (2007) indeed shows very small shifts ($\lesssim$ 1%) relative
to the prediction in {\it linear theory} in real space. The shifts can be
predicted accurately for scales where the perturbation theory is reliable.
"
What is the entropy of two centered small black holes in a class of N=4 supersymmetric string theories?,"  The exact spectrum of dyons in a class of N=4 supersymmetric string theories
is known to change discontinuously across walls of marginal stability. We show
that the change in the degeneracy across the walls of marginal stability can be
accounted for precisely by the entropy of two centered small black holes which
disappear as we cross the walls of marginal stability.
"
What is the criterion that characterizes geodesic vectors in homogeneous Finsler spaces?,"  In this paper, we study homogeneous geodesics in homogeneous Finsler spaces.
We first give a simple criterion that characterizes geodesic vectors. We show
that the geodesics on a Lie group, relative to a bi-invariant Finsler metric,
are the cosets of the one-parameter subgroups. The existence of infinitely many
homogeneous geodesics on compact semi-simple Lie group is established. We
introduce the notion of naturally reductive homogeneous Finsler space. As a
special case, we study homogeneous geodesics in homogeneous Randers spaces.
Finally, we study some curvature properties of homogeneous geodesics. In
particular, we prove that the S-curvature vanishes along the homogeneous
geodesics.
"
What is the relationship between the Dirac equation and the Dirac wave equation?,"  The hypothesis is suggested that the equation for the Dirac free wave field
is, in fact, a group-theoretical relation describing propagation of specific
microscopic deviations of space geometry from the euclidean one (closed
topological manifolds). The Dirac equation for a hydrogen atom can also be
interpreted as a relation that accounts for the symmetry properties of a piece
of curved space. Within the framework of this concept, atoms have no any
pointlike particles (electrons) inside, and the gauge invariance of
electromagnetic field proves to be the natural consequence of the basic
principles of the proposed geometrical approach.
"
What is the principle of minimal flavor violation (MFV) used to avoid flavor changing neutral currents?,"  New physics at the weak scale that can couple to quarks typically gives rise
to unacceptably large flavor changing neutral currents. An attractive way to
avoid this problem is to impose the principal of minimal flavor violation
(MFV). Recently it was noted that in MFV only scalars with the same gauge
quantum numbers as the standard model Higgs doublet or color octet scalars with
the same weak quantum numbers as the Higgs doublet can couple to quarks. In
this paper we compute the one-loop rate for production of a single color octet
scalar through gluon fusion at the LHC, which can become greater than the tree
level pair production rate for octet scalar masses around a TeV. We also
calculate the precision electroweak constraint from Z decays to a b and anti-b
quark; this constraint on color octet mass and Yukawa coupling affects the
allowed range for single octet scalar production through gluon fusion.
"
What is the phase of the 1H-NMR spectrum in the antiferromagnetic wheel CsFe8?,"  The 1H-NMR spectrum and nuclear relaxation rate 1/T_1 in the
antiferromagnetic wheel CsFe8 were measured to characterize the previously
observed magnetic field-induced low-temperature phase around the level crossing
at 8 T. The data show that the phase is characterized by a huge staggered
transverse polarization of the electronic Fe spins, and the opening of a gap,
providing microscopic evidence for the interpretation of the phase as a
field-induced magneto-elastic instability.
"
What is the possible mechanism that could produce the thin filaments in the mini-spiral around SgrA*?,"  Context: L'-band (3.8 micron) images of the Galactic Center show a large
number of thin filaments in the mini-spiral, located west of the mini-cavity
and along the inner edge of the Northern Arm. One possible mechanism that could
produce such structures is the interaction of a central wind with the
mini-spiral. Additionally, we identify similar features that appear to be
associated with stars. Aims: We present the first proper motion measurements of
the thin dust filaments observed in the central parsec around SgrA* and
investigate possible mechanisms that could be responsible for the observed
motions. Methods: The observations have been carried out using the NACO
adaptive optics system at the ESO VLT. The images have been transformed to a
common coordinate system and features of interest were extracted. Then a
cross-correlation technique could be performed in order to determine the
offsets between the features with respect to their position in the reference
epoch. Results: We derive the proper motions of a number of filaments and 2
cometary shaped dusty sources close (in projection) to SgrA*. We show that the
shape and the motion of the filaments does not agree with a purely Keplerian
motion of the gas in the potential of the supermassive black hole at the
position of SgrA*. Therefore, additional mechanisms must be responsible for
their formation and motion. We argue that the properties of the filaments are
probably related to an outflow from the disk of young mass-losing stars around
SgrA*. In part, the outflow may originate from the black hole itself. We also
present some evidence and theoretical considerations that the outflow may be
collimated.
"
What are the degeneracies of the energy spectrum in the quantum system?,"  We consider a particle moving on a cone and bound to its tip by $1/r$ or
harmonic oscillator potentials. When the deficit angle of the cone divided by
$2 \pi$ is a rational number, all bound classical orbits are closed.
Correspondingly, the quantum system has accidental degeneracies in the discrete
energy spectrum. An accidental SU(2) symmetry is generated by the rotations
around the tip of the cone as well as by a Runge-Lenz vector. Remarkably, some
of the corresponding multiplets have fractional ``spin'' and unusual
degeneracies.
"
"What are the ab-initio calculations for 3H, 4He, 16O, and 40Ca based on two-nucleon low-momentum interactions Vlowk within coupled-cluster theory?","  We present ab-initio calculations for 3H, 4He, 16O, and 40Ca based on
two-nucleon low-momentum interactions Vlowk within coupled-cluster theory. For
3H and 4He, our results are within 70 keV and 10 keV of the corresponding
Faddeev and Faddeev-Yakubovsky energies. We study in detail the convergence
with respect to the size of the model space and the single-particle basis. For
the heavier nuclei, we report practically converged binding energies and
compare with other approaches.
"
What are the applications of the new tool?,"  We introduce a new tool to study the spectral type of rank one
transformations using the method of central limit theorem for trigonometric
sums. We get some new applications.
"
"What is the main lemma presented in this paper, and what does it imply for the chromatic number of a graph?","  We improve upper bounds on the chromatic number proven independently in
\cite{reedNote} and \cite{ingo}. Our main lemma gives a sufficient condition
for two paths in graph to be completely joined. Using this, we prove that if a
graph has an optimal coloring with more than $\frac{\omega}{2}$ singleton color
classes, then it satisfies $\chi \leq \frac{\omega + \Delta + 1}{2}$. It
follows that a graph satisfying $n - \Delta < \alpha + \frac{\omega - 1}{2}$
must also satisfy $\chi \leq \frac{\omega + \Delta + 1}{2}$, improving the
bounds in \cite{reedNote} and \cite{ingo}. We then give a simple argument
showing that if a graph satisfies $\chi > \frac{n + 3 - \alpha}{2}$, then it
also satisfies $\chi(G) \leq \left\lceil\frac{\omega(G) + \Delta(G) +
1}{2}\right\rceil$. From this it follows that a graph satisfying $n - \Delta <
\alpha + \omega$ also satisfies $\chi(G) \leq \left\lceil\frac{\omega(G) +
\Delta(G) + 1}{2}\right\rceil$ improving the bounds in \cite{reedNote} and
\cite{ingo} even further at the cost of a ceiling. In the next sections, we
generalize our main lemma to constrained colorings (e.g. r-bounded colorings).
We present a generalization of Reed's conjecture to r-bounded colorings and
prove the conjecture for graphs with maximal degree close to their order.
Finally, we outline some applications (in \cite{BorodinKostochka} and
\cite{ColoringWithDoublyCriticalEdge}) of the theory presented here to the
Borodin-Kostochka conjecture and coloring graphs containing a doubly critical
edge.
"
What are the implications of the self-decelerating branch of the Chaplygin gas model in terms of the coincidence problem and fine-tuning?,"  The expansion of the Universe is accelerated as testified by observations of
SNeIa at varying redshifts. Explanations of this acceleration are of two kinds:
modifications of Einstein gravity or new forms of energy. An example of
modified gravity is the braneworld Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati (DGP) model, an
example of dark energy is Chaplygin gas. Both are characterized by a cross-over
length scale $r_c$ which marks the transition between physics occurring on our
four-dimensional brane, and in a five-dimensional bulk space. Assuming that the
scales $r_c$ in the two models are the same, we study Chaplygin gas dark energy
in flat DGP geometries. The self-accelerating branch does not give a viable
model, it causes too much acceleration. We derive the Hubble function and the
luminosity distance for the self-decelerating branch, and then fit a
compilation of 192 SNeIa magnitudes and redshifts in the space of the three
parameters of the model. Our model with the self-decelerating branch fits the
supernova data as successfully as does the $\Lambda CDM$ model, and with only
one additional parameter. In contrast to the $\Lambda CDM$ model, this model
needs no fine-tuning, and it can explain the coincidence problem. It is unique
in the sense that it cannot be reduced to a cosmological constant model in any
other limit of the parameter space than in the distant future. If later tests
with other cosmological data are successful, we have here a first indication
that we live in a five-dimensional braneworld.
"
What is the relationship between the Euler equations and the energy conservation of velocities in a function space?,"  Onsager conjectured that weak solutions of the Euler equations for
incompressible fluids in 3D conserve energy only if they have a certain minimal
smoothness, (of order of 1/3 fractional derivatives) and that they dissipate
energy if they are rougher. In this paper we prove that energy is conserved for
velocities in the function space $B^{1/3}_{3,c(\NN)}$. We show that this space
is sharp in a natural sense. We phrase the energy spectrum in terms of the
Littlewood-Paley decomposition and show that the energy flux is controlled by
local interactions. This locality is shown to hold also for the helicity flux;
moreover, every weak solution of the Euler equations that belongs to
$B^{2/3}_{3,c(\NN)}$ conserves helicity. In contrast, in two dimensions, the
strong locality of the enstrophy holds only in the ultraviolet range.
"
What is the five-quark system uudd{\bar s} in the standard non-relativistic quark model?,"  We study the five-quark system $uudd{\bar s}$ in the standard
non-relativistic quark model by solving the scattering problem. Using the
Gaussian Expansion Method (GEM), we perform the almost precise multi-quark
calculations by treating a very large five-body modelspace including the NK
scattering channel explicitly. Although a lot of pseudostates (discretized
continuum states) with $J^\pi={1/2}^\pm$ and $J^\pi={3/2}^\pm$ are obtained
within the bound-state approximation, all the states in $1.4-1.85$ GeV in mass
around ${\rm {\rm \Theta}}^+(1540)$ melt into non-resonant continuum states
through the coupling with the NK scattering state in the realistic case, i.e.,
there is no five-quark resonance below 1.85GeV. Instead, we predict a
five-quark resonance state of $J^\pi={1/2}^-$ with the mass of about 1.9GeV and
the width of $\Gamma \simeq$ 2.68MeV. Similar calculation is done for the
four-quark system $c{\bar c}q{\bar q}$ ($q=u,d$) in connection with
X$^0$(3872).
"
What are the gauge-invariant superspace action and supersymmetry generators in d=10 super-Yang-Mills?,"  After adding 7 auxiliary scalars to the d=10 super-Yang-Mills action, 9 of
the 16 supersymmetries close off-shell. In this paper, these 9 supersymmetry
generators are related by dimensional reduction to scalar and vector
topological symmetry in $\N$=2 d=8 twisted super-Yang-Mills. Furthermore, a
gauge-invariant superspace action is constructed for d=10 super-Yang-Mills
where the superfields depend on 9 anticommuting theta variables.
"
What are the rules for determining the representations of higher level boundary bound states in supersymmetric factorized scattering theory?,"  This thesis contains three main parts, which are largely independent. In the
first part we deal with the boundary bootstrap in supersymmetric factorized
scattering theory. We give a description of supersymmetry in the case when the
space is a half-line and present rules for the determination of the
representations in which higher level boundary bound states transform, and for
the determination of the supersymmetric one-particle reflection matrix factors
for the higher level boundary bound states. These rules apply under the
condition that the bulk particles transform in the kink or in the boson-fermion
representation. Examples for the application of these rules to specific models
are also given. In the second part we investigate the problem whether the TCSA
spectrum can be approximated by the spectrum of the original Hamiltonian
operator in which the coefficients of the terms are suitably changed. The
investigation is done in the case of the critical Ising model on a strip with
an external magnetic field on one of the boundaries. Another truncation method
that preserves the solvability of the model is also considered. The results of
perturbative and numerical calculations show that the above approximation is
possible and that the qualitative behaviour of the truncated spectrum as a
function of the coupling constant depends on the truncation method. In the
third part we investigate the phase structure of the two- and three-frequency
sine-Gordon models using the TCSA. In the case of the three-frequency model the
tricritical point, several points of the critical line and a few points of the
line of first order transition are found.
"
What are the modifications to predictions for the abundances of light elements from standard Big-Bang nucleosynthesis?,"  We investigate the modifications to predictions for the abundances of light
elements from standard Big-Bang nucleosynthesis when exotic late-decaying
particles with lifetimes exceeding ~1 sec are prominent in the early Universe.
Utilising a model-independent analysis of the properties of these long-lived
particles, we identify the parameter space associated with models that are
consistent with all observational data and hence resolve the much discussed
discrepancies between observations and theoretical predictions for the
abundances of Li^7 and Li^6.
"
What is the nature of the attractor in the Bianchi-I spacetime for a magnetized self-gravitating Fermi gas?,"  We use the Bianchi-I spacetime to study the local dynamics of a magnetized
self-gravitating Fermi gas. The set of Einstein-Maxwell field equations for
this gas becomes a dynamical system in a 4-dimensional phase space. We consider
a qualitative study and examine numeric solutions for the degenerate zero
temperature case. All dynamic quantities exhibit similar qualitative behavior
in the 3-dimensional sections of the phase space, with all trajectories
reaching a stable attractor whenever the initial expansion scalar H_{0} is
negative. If H_{0} is positive, and depending on initial conditions, the
trajectories end up in a curvature singularity that could be isotropic(singular
""point"") or anisotropic (singular ""line""). In particular, for a sufficiently
large initial value of the magnetic field it is always possible to obtain an
anisotropic type of singularity in which the ""line"" points in the same
direction of the field.
"
What is the main result of the withdrawn paper?,"  The paper has benn withdrawn because the computation of the external virial
contains an error which invalidate the main result.
"
What is the relation between the linear polarimetry and the mass-loss rates of massive stars?,"  Clumping in the winds of massive stars may significantly reduce empirical
mass-loss rates, and which in turn may have a large impact on our understanding
of massive star evolution. Here, we investigate wind-clumping through the
linear polarization induced by light scattering off the clumps. Through the use
of an analytic wind clumping model, we predict the time evolution of the linear
polarimetry over a large parameter space. We concentrate on the Luminous Blue
Variables, which display the greatest amount of polarimetric variability and
for which we recently conducted a spectropolarimetric survey. Our model results
indicate that the observed level of polarimetric variability can be reproduced
for two regimes of parameter space: one of a small number of massive,
optically-thick clumps; and one of a very large number of low-mass clumps.
Although a systematic time-resolved monitoring campaign is required to
distinguish between the two scenarios, we currently favour the latter, given
the short timescale of the observed polarization variability. As the
polarization is predicted to scale linearly with mass-loss rate, we anticipate
that all hot stars with very large mass-loss rates should display polarimetric
variability. This is consistent with recent findings that intrinsic
polarization is more common in stars with strong H$\alpha$ emission.
"
What are the conditions for a graph to be a planar discontinuous group?,"  Planar locally finite graphs which are almost vertex transitive are
discussed. If the graph is 3-connected and has at most one end then the group
of automorphisms is a planar discontinuous group and its structure is
well-known. A general result is obtained for such graphs where no restriction
is put on the number of ends. It is shown that such a graph can be built up
from one ended or finite planar graphs in a precise way. The results give a
classification of the finitely generated groups with planar Cayley graphs.
"
What are the kinetic energy contributions to the total energy of the ground and excited states of the quantized Skyrmions?,"  We consider the rigid body quantization of Skyrmions with topological charges
1 to 8, as approximated by the rational map ansatz. Novel, general expressions
for the elements of the inertia tensors, in terms of the approximating rational
map, are presented and are used to determine the kinetic energy contribution to
the total energy of the ground and excited states of the quantized Skyrmions.
Our results are compared to the experimentally determined energy levels of the
corresponding nuclei, and the energies and spins of a few as yet unobserved
states are predicted.
"
What is the origin of the numerals that we inherited from the Arabo-Islamic civilization?,"  The origin of the numerals that we inherited from the arabo-Islamic
civilization remained one enigma. The hypothesis of the Indian origin remained,
with controversies, without serious rival. It was the dominant hypothesis since
more of one century. Its partisans found to it and constructed a lot of
arguments. The testimonies of the medieval authors have been interpreted to its
advantage. The opposite opinions have been dismissed and ignored. An amalgam
between the history of our modern numerals and the Indian mathematics history
is made. Rational contradictions often passed under silence. A meticulous
observation of the numerals permits to affirm that our numerals are in fact
more or less modified Arabic letters. The ""Ghubari"" shape of the numerals shows
that the symbol of a numeral corresponds to the Arabic letter whose numerical
value is equal to this numeral. The numerals don't have a simple resemblance
with some Arabic letters, but every number looks like the Arabic letter whose
numerical value is equal to this numeral. The elements of the ''Abjadi''
calculation gives us a theoretical support, independent of the letters and
numerals, witch explains our observation. Besides a re-lecture of the
testimonies of the medieval authors, particularly the testimony of Al-Biruni,
that is probably at the origin of all others testimonies speaking of the Indian
origin of the numerals, is in agreement with the fact that our numerals are
Arabic letters. We have there a second way concerning the origin of our modern
numerals that is only to its beginnings. The deepened researches are necessary
to understand the history of our numerals better. A rigorous re-lecture of the
medieval testimonies with a new mind imposes itself.
"
What are the closed form expressions for the variance of the undetected error probability?,"  In this paper, an analysis of the undetected error probability of ensembles
of binary matrices is presented. The ensemble called the Bernoulli ensemble
whose members are considered as matrices generated from i.i.d. Bernoulli source
is mainly considered here. The main contributions of this work are (i)
derivation of the error exponent of the average undetected error probability
and (ii) closed form expressions for the variance of the undetected error
probability. It is shown that the behavior of the exponent for a sparse
ensemble is somewhat different from that for a dense ensemble. Furthermore, as
a byproduct of the proof of the variance formula, simple covariance formula of
the weight distribution is derived.
"
What is the role of electron correlation in the Y2Ir2O7 system?,"  We report the observation of an unusual behavior of highly extended 5d
electrons in Y2Ir2O7 belonging to pyrochlore family of great current interest
using high resolution photoemission spectroscopy. The experimental bulk spectra
reveal an intense lower Hubbard band in addition to weak intensities in the
vicinity of the Fermi level, e_F. This provides a direct evidence for strong
electron correlation among the 5d electrons, despite their highly extended
nature. The high resolution spectrum at room temperature exhibits a pseudogap
at e_F and |e - e_F|^2 dependence demonstrating the importance of electron
correlation in this system. Remarkably, in the magnetically ordered phase (T <
150 K), the spectral lineshape evolves to a |e - e_F|^1.5 dependence
emphasizing the dominant role of electron-magnon coupling.
"
What are the key concepts in the algorithmic classification of symplectic cohomology?,"  These are lecture notes from my talks at the ""Current Developments in
Mathematics"" conference (Harvard, 2006). They cover a variety of topics
involving symplectic cohomology. In particular, a discussion of (algorithmic)
classification issues in symplectic and contact topology is included.
"
What is the concept of simplicial complex for structural analysis?,"  This paper introduces a model that identifies spatial relationships for a
structural analysis based on the concept of simplicial complex. The spatial
relationships are identified through overlapping two map layers, namely a
primary layer and a contextual layer. The identified spatial relationships are
represented as a simplical complex, in which simplices and vertices
respectively represent two layers of objects. The model relies on the simplical
complex for structural representation and analysis. To quantify structural
properties of individual primary objects (or equivalently simplices), and the
simplicial complex as a whole, we define a set of centrality measures by
considering multidimensional chains of connectivity, i.e. the number of
contextual objects shared by a pair of primary objects. With the model, the
interaction and relationships with a geographic system are modeled from both
local and global perspectives. The structural properties and modeling
capabilities are illustrated with a simple example and a case study applied to
the structural analysis of an urban system.
"
What is the large subset of initial data evolving nearly linearly in a nonlinear Schrödinger equation with periodic boundary conditions?,"  It is shown that a large subset of initial data with finite energy ($L^2$
norm)evolves nearly linearly in nonlinear Schr\"" odinger equation with periodic
boundary conditions. These new solutions are not perturbations of the known
ones such as solitons, semiclassical or weakly linear solutions.
"
What are the key components of the infrared cloud monitor for a robotic telescope?,"  We present the most successful infrared cloud monitor for a robotic
telescope. This system was originally developed for the MAGNUM 2-m telescope,
which has been achieving unmanned and automated monitoring observation of
active galactic nuclei at Haleakala on the Hawaiian island of Maui since 2001.
Using a thermal imager and two aspherical mirrors, it at once sees almost the
whole sky at a wavelength of $\lambda\sim 10\mu{\rm m}$. Its outdoor part is
weather-proof and is totally maintenance-free. The images obtained every one or
two minutes are analysed immediately into several ranks of weather condition,
from which our automated observing system not only decides to open or close the
dome, but also selects what types of observations should be done. The whole-sky
data accumulated over four years show that 50$-$60 % of all nights are
photometric, and about 75 % are observable with respect to cloud condition at
Haleakala. Many copies of this system are now used all over the world such as
Mauna Kea in Hawaii, Atacama in Chile, and Okayama and Kiso in Japan.
"
What is the primary goal of the SkyMapper telescope?,"  SkyMapper is amongst the first of a new generation of dedicated, wide-field
survey telescopes. The 1.3m SkyMapper telescope features a 5.7 square degree
field-of-view Cassegrain imager and will see first light in late 2007. The
primary goal of the facility is to conduct the Southern Sky Survey a six
colour, six epoch survey of the southern sky. The survey will provide
photometry for objects between 8th and 23rd magnitude with global photometric
accuracy of 0.03 magnitudes and astrometry to 50 mas. This will represent a
valuable scientific resource for the southern sky and in addition provide a
basis for photometric and astrometric calibration of imaging data.
"
What are the factors that control the emergence of spontaneous oscillations in the velocity?,"  We present a simple and generic theoretical description of actin-based
motility, where polymerization of filaments maintains propulsion. The dynamics
is driven by polymerization kinetics at the filaments' free ends, crosslinking
of the actin network, attachment and detachment of filaments to the obstacle
interfaces and entropic forces. We show that spontaneous oscillations in the
velocity emerge in a broad range of parameter values, and compare our findings
with experiments.
"
What is the impact of the fabrication procedure on the electron gas in AlGaN/GaN heterostructure?,"  The magnetotransport in a set of identical parallel AlGaN/GaN quantum wire
structures was investigated. The width of the wires was ranging between 1110 nm
and 340 nm. For all sets of wires clear Shubnikov--de Haas oscillations are
observed. We find that the electron concentration and mobility is approximately
the same for all wires, confirming that the electron gas in the AlGaN/GaN
heterostructure is not deteriorated by the fabrication procedure of the wire
structures. For the wider quantum wires the weak antilocalization effect is
clearly observed, indicating the presence of spin-orbit coupling. For narrow
quantum wires with an effective electrical width below 250 nm the weak
antilocalization effect is suppressed. By comparing the experimental data to a
theoretical model for quasi one-dimensional structures we come to the
conclusion that the spin-orbit scattering length is enhanced in narrow wires.

How is the lowest secular term in the expansion of the lpKdV equation derived?,"  We present a discrete multiscale expansion of the lattice potential
Korteweg-de Vries (lpKdV) equation on functions of infinite order of
slow-varyness. To do so we introduce a formal expansion of the shift operator
on many lattices holding at all orders. The lowest secularity condition from
the expansion of the lpKdV equation gives a nonlinear lattice equation,
depending on shifts of all orders, of the form of the nonlinear Schr\""odinger
(NLS) equation
"
What is the relationship between the dg Lie algebras and the quotient category of L∞ morphisms modulo the gauge relation?,"  Let $\g_1$ and $\g_2$ be two dg Lie algebras, then it is well-known that the
$L_\infty$ morphisms from $\g_1$ to $\g_2$ are in 1-1 correspondence to the
solutions of the Maurer-Cartan equation in some dg Lie algebra
$\Bbbk(\g_1,\g_2)$. Then the gauge action by exponents of the zero degree
component $\Bbbk(\g_1,\g_2)^0$ on $MC\subset\Bbbk(\g_1,\g_2)^1$ gives an
explicit ""homotopy relation"" between two $L_\infty$ morphisms. We prove that
the quotient category by this relation (that is, the category whose objects are
$L_\infty$ algebras and morphisms are $L_\infty$ morphisms modulo the gauge
relation) is well-defined, and is a localization of the category of dg Lie
algebras and dg Lie maps by quasi-isomorphisms. As localization is unique up to
an equivalence, it is equivalent to the Quillen-Hinich homotopical category of
dg Lie algebras [Q1,2], [H1,2]. Moreover, we prove that the Quillen's concept
of a homotopy coincides with ours. The last result was conjectured by
V.Dolgushev [D].
"
What are the kinds of $^{40}$Ca structures observed in the positive-parity states of $^{40}$Ca using AMD and GCM?,"  We have studied the positive-parity states of $^{40}$Ca using antisymmetrized
molecular dynamics (AMD) and the generator coordinate method (GCM). Imposing
two different kinds of constraints on the variational calculation, we have
found various kinds of $^{40}{\rm Ca}$ structures such as a deformed-shell
structure, as well as $\alpha$-$^{36}$Ar and $^{12}$C-$^{28}$Si cluster
structures. After the GCM calculation, we obtained a normal-deformed band and a
superdeformed band together with their side bands associated with triaxial
deformation. The calculated $B(E2)$ values agreed well with empirical data. It
was also found that the normal-deformed and superdeformed bands have a
non-negligible $\alpha$-$^{36}$Ar cluster component and $^{12}$C-$^{28}$Si
cluster component, respectively. This leads to the presence of an
$\alpha$-$^{36}$Ar higher-nodal band occurring above the normal-deformed band.
"
What are the factors that affect the mass sensitivity of these observables?,"  A key step towards the understanding of the origin of ultra-high energy
cosmic rays is their mass composition. Primary photons and neutrinos produce
markedly different showers from nuclei, while showers of different nuclear
species are not easy to distinguish. To maximise the discrimination with the
Pierre Auger Observatory ideally all mass-sensitive observables should be
combined, but the 10% duty cycle of the fluorescence detector limits the use of
direct measurements of shower maximum at the highest energies. Therefore, we
investigate mass-sensitive observables accessible with the surface detectors
alone. These are the signal risetime in the Cherenkov stations, the curvature
of the shower front, the muon-to-electromagnetic ratio, and the azimuthal
signal asymmetry. Risetime and curvature depend mainly on the depth of the
shower development in the atmosphere, and thus on primary energy and mass. The
muon content of a shower depends on the primary energy and the number of
nucleons, while asymmetry about the shower core is due to geometric effects and
attenuation, which are dependent on the primary mass. The mass sensitivity of
these variables is demonstrated and their application for composition studies
is discussed.
"
What are the related operators in SUSY quantum mechanics?,"  Interpolation of two adjacent Hamiltonians in SUSY quantum mechanics
$H_s=(1-s)A^{\dagger}A + sAA^{\dagger}$, $0\le s\le 1$ is discussed together
with related operators. For a wide variety of shape-invariant degree one
quantum mechanics and their `discrete' counterparts, the interpolation
Hamiltonian is also shape-invariant, that is it takes the same form as the
original Hamiltonian with shifted coupling constant(s).
"
What is the Coulomb interaction between electrons in graphene treated with the renormalized-ring-diagram approximation?,"  Using the tight-binding model with long-range Coulomb interactions between
electrons, we study some of the electronic properties of graphene. The Coulomb
interactions are treated with the renormalized-ring-diagram approximation. By
self-consistently solving the integral equations for the Green function, we
calculate the spectral density. The obtained result is in agreement with
experimental observation. In addition, we also compute the density of states,
the distribution functions, and the ground-state energy. Within the present
approximation, we find that the imaginary part of the self-energy fixed at the
Fermi momentum varies as quadratic in energy close to the chemical potential,
regardless the system is doped or not. This result appears to indicate that the
electrons in graphene always behave like a moderately correlated Fermi liquid.
"
What is the relationship between quantum mechanical ground states and the quasi-particle weight in systems of strongly correlated fermions on geometrically frustrated lattices?,"  Systems of strongly correlated fermions on certain geometrically frustrated
lattices at particular filling factors support excitations with fractional
charges $\pm e/2$. We calculate quantum mechanical ground states, low--lying
excitations and spectral functions of finite lattices by means of numerical
diagonalization. The ground state of the most thoroughfully studied case, the
criss-crossed checkerboard lattice, is degenerate and shows long--range order.
Static fractional charges are confined by a weak linear force, most probably
leading to bound states of large spatial extent. Consequently, the
quasi-particle weight is reduced, which reflects the internal dynamics of the
fractionally charged excitations. By using an additional parameter, we
fine--tune the system to a special point at which fractional charges are
manifestly deconfined--the so--called Rokhsar--Kivelson point. For a deeper
understanding of the low--energy physics of these models and for numerical
advantages, several conserved quantum numbers are identified.
"
What is the effect of the mass of the parent star on the likelihood of a planet forming a habitable zone with sufficient disk mass?,"  Smaller terrestrial planets (< 0.3 Earth masses) are less likely to retain
the substantial atmospheres and ongoing tectonic activity probably required to
support life. A key element in determining if sufficiently massive ""sustainably
habitable"" planets can form is the availability of solid planet-forming
material. We use dynamical simulations of terrestrial planet formation from
planetary embryos and simple scaling arguments to explore the implications of
correlations between terrestrial planet mass, disk mass, and the mass of the
parent star. We assume that the protoplanetary disk mass scales with stellar
mass as Mdisk ~ f Mstar^h, where f measures the relative disk mass, and 1/2 < h
< 2, so that disk mass decreases with decreasing stellar mass. We consider
systems without Jovian planets, based on current models and observations for M
stars. We assume the mass of a planet formed in some annulus of a disk with
given parameters is proportional to the disk mass in that annulus, and show
with a suite of simulations of late-stage accretion that the adopted
prescription is surprisingly accurate. Our results suggest that the fraction of
systems with sufficient disk mass to form > 0.3 Earth mass habitable planets
decreases for low-mass stars for every realistic combination of parameters.
This ""habitable fraction"" is small for stellar masses below a mass in the
interval 0.5 to 0.8 Solar masses, depending on disk parameters, an interval
that excludes most M stars. Radial mixing and therefore water delivery are
inefficient in lower-mass disks commonly found around low-mass stars, such that
terrestrial planets in the habitable zones of most low-mass stars are likely to
be small and dry.
"
What is the influence of excitonic correlations on the vectorial polarization state of polaritons in semiconductor microcavities?,"  Based on a microscopic many-particle theory we investigate the influence of
excitonic correlations on the vectorial polarization state characteristics of
the parametric amplification of polaritons in semiconductor microcavities. We
study a microcavity with perfect in-plane isotropy. A linear stability analysis
of the cavity polariton dynamics shows that in the co-linear (TE-TE or TM-TM)
pump-probe polarization state configuration, excitonic correlations diminish
the parametric scattering process whereas it is enhanced by excitonic
correlations in the cross-linear (TE-TM or TM-TE) configuration. Without any
free parameters, our microscopic theory gives a quantitative understanding how
many-particle effects can lead to a rotation or change of the outgoing
(amplified) probe signal's vectorial polarization state relative to the
incoming one's.
"
What is the Fuchsian system of differential equations used to solve the Heun equation?,"  We obtain integral representations of solutions to special cases of the
Fuchsian system of differential equations and Heun's differential equation. In
particular, we calculate the monodromy of solutions to the Fuchsian equation
that corresponds to Picard's solution of the sixth Painlev\'e equation, and to
Heun's equation.
"
What are the differences between VDM and color dipole approaches for vector meson production?,"  Vector meson production in ultra-peripheral collisions of heavy ions at LHC
is calculated in VDM and color dipole approaches.
"
The results of this article will be added in a later paper.,"  The article has been withdrawn by the author. Wolfgang Lueck and Peter
Linnell pointed out that the proof of Lemma 3.8 does not apply to the
unrestricted case of wreath product. It is not clear at this stage how to
complete the proof of Theorem 3.1 using the present version of Lemma 3.8. The
valid results originating from this article will be added in a later paper.
"
What is the epistemic view of quantum mechanics?,"  The toy model used by Spekkens [R. Spekkens, Phys. Rev. A 75, 032110 (2007)]
to argue in favor of an epistemic view of quantum mechanics is extended by
generalizing his definition of pure states (i.e. states of maximal knowledge)
and by associating measurements with all pure states. The new toy model does
not allow signaling but, in contrast to the Spekkens model, does violate
Bell-CHSH inequalities. Negative probabilities are found to arise naturally
within the model, and can be used to explain the Bell-CHSH inequality
violations.
"
What is the parametric representation of non-commutative quantum field theory?,"  Using the recently introduced parametric representation of non-commutative
quantum field theory, we implement here the dimensional regularization and
renormalization of the vulcanized $\Phi^{\star 4}_4$ model on the Moyal space.
"
What are the lattice properties of the arithmetic mean ideals of B(H)?,"  This part of a multi-paper project studies the lattice properties of the
arithmetic mean ideals of B(H) introduced by Dykema, Figiel, Weiss, and
Wodzicki. We prove: the lattices of all principal ideals, of arithmetic mean or
arithmetic mean at infinity stable principal ideals or of principal ideals with
a generator that satisfies the Delta_1/2 condition, are all both upper and
lower dense in the lattice of general ideals. That is, between any ideal and an
ideal (nested above or below respectively) in one of these sublattices, lies
another ideal in that sublattice. Among the applications: a principal ideal I
is am-stable (I = I_a) if and only if any of its first order arithmetic mean
ideals are am-stable if and only if the ideal satisfies the first order
equality cancellation property: J_a = I_a implies J = I. We show that this
cancellation property can fail even for am-stable countably generated ideals.
Similar results hold for arithmetic mean at infinity ideals. Inclusion
cancellations do not hold in general even for principal ideals, but for every
ideal I there is a largest ideal I^ for which J_a contains I_a implies that J
contains I^. When I is principal, I^ too is principal. We show that I=I^ is a
strictly stronger property than am-stability. For example, for I the p < 1
power of the principal ideal J generated by diag {1/n}, I^ is the q power of J
where 1/p-1/q = 1.
"
What are the implications of the universal features of the Aslamazov-Larkin theory for nearly-free paired fermions?,"  We revisit the Aslamazov-Larkin theory of paraconductivity in two dimensions,
to distinguish its universal features from the specific features of nearly-free
paired fermions. We show that both the numerical prefactor and the temperature
dependence of the experimental paraconductivity in underdoped La_{2-x}Sr_xCuO_4
are only compatible with pairing of nearly-free fermionic quasiparticles. This
conclusion is strengthened by the analysis of paraconductivity data in the
presence of a finite magnetic field, from which we extract a rather low value
of the critical field H_{c2}(T=0).
"
What are the benefits of cooperative transmission protocols with multiuser detection (MUD)?,"  Cooperative transmission is an emerging communication technique that takes
advantages of the broadcast nature of wireless channels. However, due to low
spectral efficiency and the requirement of orthogonal channels, its potential
for use in future wireless networks is limited. In this paper, by making use of
multiuser detection (MUD) and network coding, cooperative transmission
protocols with high spectral efficiency, diversity order, and coding gain are
developed. Compared with the traditional cooperative transmission protocols
with single-user detection, in which the diversity gain is only for one source
user, the proposed MUD cooperative transmission protocols have the merits that
the improvement of one user's link can also benefit the other users. In
addition, using MUD at the relay provides an environment in which network
coding can be employed. The coding gain and high diversity order can be
obtained by fully utilizing the link between the relay and the destination.
  From the analysis and simulation results, it is seen that the proposed
protocols achieve higher diversity gain, better asymptotic efficiency, and
lower bit error rate, compared to traditional MUD and to existing cooperative
transmission protocols.
"
What is the classical laws of motion related to time and entropy?,"  This contribution analyses the classical laws of motion by means of an
approach relating time and entropy. We argue that adopting the notion of change
of states as opposed to the usual derivation of Newton's laws in terms of
fields a broader picture is obtained, suggesting that diverse branches of
physics- classical, quantum, relativistic and statistical mechanics - turn out
to be related by a common foundation.
"
What is the minimum number of questions required to determine an integer between one and one million?,"  Ulam asked for the maximum number of questions required to determine an
integer between one and one million by asking questions whose answer is `Yes'
or `No' and where one untruthful answer is allowed. Pelc showed that the number
of questions required is 25. Here we give a simple proof of this result.
"
What are the quasi-particles used to encode the liquid and glass disorder?,"  We study a recently introduced model of one-component glass-forming liquids
whose constituents interact with anisotropic potential. This system is
interesting per-se and as a model of liquids like glycerol (interacting via
hydrogen bonds) which are excellent glass formers. We work out the statistical
mechanics of this system, encoding the liquid and glass disorder using
appropriate quasi-particles (36 of them). The theory provides a full
explanation of the glass transition phenomenology, including the identification
of a diverging length scale and a relation between the structural changes and
the diverging relaxation times.
"
What is the relationship between the diffracted field and the groove geometry in the near-zone close to the groove?,"  We present a numerical study and analytical model of the optical near-field
diffracted in the vicinity of subwavelength grooves milled in silver surfaces.
The Green's tensor approach permits computation of the phase and amplitude
dependence of the diffracted wave as a function of the groove geometry. It is
shown that the field diffracted along the interface by the groove is equivalent
to replacing the groove by an oscillating dipolar line source. An analytic
expression is derived from the Green's function formalism, that reproduces well
the asymptotic surface plasmon polariton (SPP) wave as well as the transient
surface wave in the near-zone close to the groove. The agreement between this
model and the full simulation is very good, showing that the transient
""near-zone"" regime does not depend on the precise shape of the groove. Finally,
it is shown that a composite diffractive evanescent wave model that includes
the asymptotic SPP can describe the wavelength evolution in this transient
near-zone. Such a semi-analytical model may be useful for the design and
optimization of more elaborate photonic circuits whose behavior in large part
will be controlled by surface waves.
"
"How do the results of the lattice QCD calculations compare to experimental values for the nucleon structure, including the polarized and unpolarized nucleon structure functions?","  In this work, I report the latest lattice QCD calculations of nucleon and
hyperon structure from chiral fermions in 2+1-flavor dynamical simulations. All
calculations are done with a chirally symmetric fermion action, domain-wall
fermions, for valence quarks. % I begin with the latest lattice results on the
nucleon structure, focusing on results from RBC/UKQCD using 2+1-flavor chiral
fermion actions. We find the chiral-extrapolated axial coupling constant at
physical pion mass point to be 1.23(5), consistent with experimental value. The
renormalization constants for the structure functions are obtained from
RI/MOM-scheme non-perturbative renormalization. We find first moments of the
polarized and unpolarized nucleon structure functions at zero transfer momentum
to be 0.133(13) and 0.203(23) respectively, using continuum chiral
extrapolation. These are consistent with the experimental values, unlike
previous calculations which have been 50% larger. We also have a prediction for
the transversity, which we find to be 0.56(4). The twist-3 matrix element is
consistent with zero which agrees with the prediction of the Wandzura-Wilczek
relation.
  In the second half of this work, I report an indirect dynamical estimation of
the strangeness proton magnetic moments using mixed actions. With the analysis
of hyperon form factors and using charge symmetry, the strangeness of proton is
found to be $-0.066(26)$, consistent with the Adelaide-JLab Collaboration's
result. The hyperon $\Sigma$ and $\Xi$ axial coupling constants are also
performed for the first time in a lattice calculation, $g_{\Sigma\Sigma}=
0.441(14)$ and $g_{\Xi\Xi} = -0.277(11)$.
"
What are the effects of the antiferromagnetic interlayer exchange on the formation of domains in multilayers?,"  Antiferromagnetically coupled multilayers with perpendicular anisotropy, as
[CoPt]/Ru, Co/Ir, Fe/Au, display ferromagnetic stripe phases as the ground
states. It is theoretically shown that the antiferromagnetic interlayer
exchange causes a relative shift of domains in adjacent layers. This ``exchange
shift'' is responsible for several recently observed effects: an anomalous
broadening of domain walls, the formation of so-called ``tiger-tail'' patterns,
and a ``mixed state'' of antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic domains in
[CoPt]/Ru multilayers. The derived analitical relations between the values of
the shift and the strength of antiferromagnetic coupling provide an effective
method for a quantitative determination of the interlayer exchange
interactions.
"
What is the jamming transition of a two-dimensional lattice gas of two species?,"  A two-dimensional lattice gas of two species, driven in opposite directions
by an external force, undergoes a jamming transition if the filling fraction is
sufficiently high. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we investigate the growth of
these jams (""clouds""), as the system approaches a non-equilibrium steady state
from a disordered initial state. We monitor the dynamic structure factor
$S(k_x,k_y;t)$ and find that the $k_x=0$ component exhibits dynamic scaling, of
the form $S(0,k_y;t)=t^\beta \tilde{S}(k_yt^\alpha)$. Over a significant range
of times, we observe excellent data collapse with $\alpha=1/2$ and $\beta=1$.
The effects of varying filling fraction and driving force are discussed.
"
What is the biomedical portal developed within the framework of the E-Infrastructure shared between Europe and Latin America?,"  Within the context of the nascent e-Science infrastructure in Venezuela, we
describe several web-based scientific applications developed at the Centro
Nacional de Calculo Cientifico Universidad de Los Andes (CeCalCULA), Merida,
and at the Instituto Venezolano de Investigaciones Cientificas (IVIC), Caracas.
The different strategies that have been followed for implementing quantum
chemistry and atomic physics applications are presented. We also briefly
discuss a damage portal based on dynamic, nonlinear, finite elements of lumped
damage mechanics and a biomedical portal developed within the framework of the
\textit{E-Infrastructure shared between Europe and Latin America} (EELA)
initiative for searching common sequences and inferring their functions in
parasitic diseases such as leishmaniasis, chagas and malaria.
"
How does the distribution of galaxies change over cosmic time due to stellar mass?,"  We selected a mass-limited sample of 4048 objects from the VIMOS VLT Deep
Survey in the redshift interval 0.5<z<1.3. We used the amplitude of the 4000
Balmer break (Dn4000) to separate the galaxy population and the EW[OII]3727
line as proxy for the star formation activity. We discuss to what extent
stellar mass drives galaxy evolution, showing for the first time the interplay
between stellar ages and stellar masses over the past 8Gyr. Low-mass galaxies
have small Dn4000 and at increasing stellar mass, the galaxy distribution moves
to higher Dn4000 values as observed in the local Universe. As cosmic time goes
by, we witness an increasing abundance of massive spectroscopically ET systems
at the expense of the LT systems. This spectral transformation is a process
started at early epochs and continuing efficiently down to the local Universe.
This is confirmed by the evolution of our type-dependent stellar mass function.
The underlying stellar ages of LT galaxies apparently do not show evolution,
likely as a result of a continuous formation of new stars. All star formation
activity indicators consistently point towards a star formation history peaked
in the past for massive galaxies, with little or no residual star formation
taking place in the most recent epochs. The activity and efficiency of forming
stars are mechanisms that depend on stellar mass, and the mass assembly becomes
progressively less efficient in massive systems as time elapses. The concepts
of star formation downsizing and mass assembly downsizing describe a single
scenario that has a top-down evolutionary pattern. The role of (dry) merging
events seems to be only marginal at z<1.3, as our estimated efficiency in
stellar mass assembly can possibly account for the progressive accumulation of
passively evolving galaxies.
"
Can $B_c$ mesons decay in decay channels with $B_s$ in final state be observed?,"  We discuss the possibility for observing $B_c$ mesons in decay channels with
$B_s$ in final state.
"
What is the nature of the criticality of the (2+1)-dimensional gonihedric model?,"  Multicriticality of the gonihedric model in 2+1 dimensions is investigated
numerically. The gonihedric model is a fully frustrated Ising magnet with the
finely tuned plaquette-type (four-body and plaquette-diagonal) interactions,
which cancel out the domain-wall surface tension. Because the
quantum-mechanical fluctuation along the imaginary-time direction is simply
ferromagnetic, the criticality of the (2+1)-dimensional gonihedric model should
be an anisotropic one; that is, the respective critical indices of real-space
(\perp) and imaginary-time (\parallel) sectors do not coincide. Extending the
parameter space to control the domain-wall surface tension, we analyze the
criticality in terms of the crossover (multicritical) scaling theory. By means
of the numerical diagonalization for the clusters with N\le 28 spins, we
obtained the correlation-length critical indices
(\nu_\perp,\nu_\parallel)=(0.45(10),1.04(27)), and the crossover exponent
\phi=0.7(2). Our results are comparable to
(\nu_{\perp},\nu_{\parallel})=(0.482,1.230), and \phi=0.688 obtained by Diehl
and Shpot for the (d,m)=(3,2) Lifshitz point with the \epsilon-expansion method
up to O(\epsilon^2).
"
What is the ASIC method used to calculate the exchange interaction for a number of materials?,"  The approximate atomic self-interaction corrections (ASIC) method to density
functional theory is put to the test by calculating the exchange interaction
for a number of prototypical materials, critical to local exchange and
correlation functionals. ASIC total energy calculations are mapped onto an
Heisenberg pair-wise interaction and the exchange constants J are compared to
those obtained with other methods. In general the ASIC scheme drastically
improves the bandstructure, which for almost all the cases investigated
resemble closely available photo-emission data. In contrast the results for the
exchange parameters are less satisfactory. Although ASIC performs reasonably
well for systems where the magnetism originates from half-filled bands, it
suffers from similar problems than those of LDA for other situations. In
particular the exchange constants are still overestimated. This reflects a
subtle interplay between exchange and correlation energy, not captured by the
ASIC.
"
What are the critical factors in the dynamical interplay of C=C stretch modes and low-frequency ring-torsional modes?,"  A quantum-dynamical analysis of phonon-driven exciton dissociation at polymer
heterojunctions is presented, using a hierarchical electron-phonon model
parameterized for three electronic states and 24 vibrational modes. Two
interfering decay pathways are identified: a direct charge separation, and an
indirect pathway via an intermediate bridge state. Both pathways depend
critically on the dynamical interplay of high-frequency C=C stretch modes and
low-frequency ring-torsional modes. The ultrafast, highly non-equilibrium
dynamics is consistent with time-resolved spectroscopic observations.
"
What is the nature of the stellar population gradients in bulges?,"  This is the first paper presenting our long-term project aimed at studying
the nature of bulges through the analysis of their stellar population
gradients. We present deep spectroscopic observations along the minor axis and
the data reduction for a sample of 32 bulges of edge-on spiral galaxies. We
explain in detail our procedures to measure their dynamical parameters
(rotation curves and velocity dispersion profiles) and line-strength indices,
including the conversion to the Lick/IDS system. Tables giving the values of
the dynamical parameters and line-strength indices at each galactocentric
radius are presented (in electronic form) for each galaxy of the sample. The
derived line-strength gradients from this dataset will be analyzed in a
forthcoming paper to set constraints on the different scenarios for the
formation of the bulges.
"
What is the interpretation of amplitudes measured in lepton production and the quark content of the nucleon?,"  We examine the relation between amplitudes measured in exclusive
lepto-production and the quark content of the nucleon. We show that in the
limit of high energy and small t, the natural interpretation of amplitudes
measured in these hard exclusive processes is in terms of the quark content of
the meson cloud and not the target itself. In this regime, Regge amplitudes
will make a significant contribution to these exclusive amplitudes. This leads
to violation of QCD scaling.
"
What are the magnetoelectric contributions to the permittivity of yttrium-doped EuMnO3 in the terahertz frequency range?,"  Dielectric permittivity spectra of yttrium-doped EuMnO$_3$ in the composition
range 0 =< x =< 0.5 have been investigated in the terahertz frequency range.
Magnetoelectric contributions to the permittivity were observed in all
compositions for ac electric fields parallel to the crystallographic a-axis.
Well defined electromagnons exist for x >= 0.2 close to \nu ~ 20 cm^{-1} and
with dielectric strength strongly increasing on doping. In addition to
electromagnons, a broad contribution of magnetoelectric origin is observed for
all compositions. For Eu_{0.8}Y_{0.2}MnO_3 the electromagnons can be suppressed
by external magnetic fields which induce a canted antiferromagnetic phase.
Magnetoelectric effects in the different doping regimes are discussed in
detail.
"
What is the relationship between the Hagedorn temperature and the Hawking-Page transition?,"  We study the thermal physics of AdS(3) and the BTZ black hole when embedded
in String theory. The exact calculation of the Hagedorn temperature in TAdS(3)
is reinterpreted as the appearance of a winding tachyon both in AdS(3) and BTZ.
We construct a dual framework for analyzing the phases of the system. In this
dual framework, tachyon condensation and geometric capping appear on the same
footing, bridging the usual gap of connecting tachyon condensation to
modifications of geometry. This allows us to construct in a natural way a
candidate for the unstable phase, analogous to a small black hole in higher
dimensions. Additional peculiar effects associated with the Hagedorn
temperature and the Hawking-Page transition, some to do with the asymptotic
structure of AdS(3) and some with strong curvature effects, are analyzed and
explained.
"
What are the key features of the dislocation network for Co nanoparticles?,"  The self-organized growth of Co nanoparticles with 10 nm periodicity was
achieved at room temperature on a Ag(001) surface patterned by an underlying
dislocation network, as shown by real time, in situ Grazing Incidence Small and
Wide Angle X-ray Scattering. The misfit dislocation network, buried at the
interface between a 5nm-thick Ag thin film and a MgO(001) substrate, induces a
periodic strain field on top of the surface. Nucleation and growth of Co on
tensile areas are found as the most favorable sites as highlighted by Molecular
Dynamic simulations.
"
What are the electroweak radiative corrections to the cross section of single W-boson inclusive hadroproduction?,"  We calculate the full one-loop electroweak radiative corrections to the cross
section of single W-boson inclusive hadroproduction at finite transverse
momentum (p_T). This includes the O(alpha) corrections to W+j production, the
O(alpha_s) corrections to W+gamma production, and the tree-level contribution
from W+j photoproduction with one direct or resolved photon in the initial
state. We present the integrated cross section as a function of a minimum-p_T
cut as well as the p_T distribution for the experimental conditions at the
Fermilab Tevatron and the CERN LHC and estimate the theoretical uncertainties.
"
What is the BRST transformation of the model under the general conditions?,"  We give a generalized Lagrangian density of 1+1 Dimensional O(3) nonlinear
sigma model with subsidiary constraints, different Lagrange multiplier fields
and topological term, find a lost intrinsic constraint condition, convert the
subsidiary constraints into inner constraints in the nonlinear sigma model,
give the example of not introducing the lost constraint, by comparing the
example with the case of introducing the lost constraint, we obtain that when
not introducing the lost constraint, one has to obtain a lot of various
non-intrinsic constraints. We further deduce the gauge generator, give general
BRST transformation of the model under the general conditions. It is discovered
that there exists a gauge parameter originating from the freedom degree of BRST
transformation in a general O(3) nonlinear sigma model, and we gain the general
commutation relations of ghost field.
"
What is the relationship between the Mabuchi K-energy and the scalar curvature of the flow?,"  The limiting behavior of the normalized K\""ahler-Ricci flow for manifolds
with positive first Chern class is examined under certain stability conditions.
First, it is shown that if the Mabuchi K-energy is bounded from below, then the
scalar curvature converges uniformly to a constant. Second, it is shown that if
the Mabuchi K-energy is bounded from below and if the lowest positive
eigenvalue of the $\bar\partial^\dagger \bar\partial$ operator on smooth vector
fields is bounded away from 0 along the flow, then the metrics converge
exponentially fast in $C^\infty$ to a K\""ahler-Einstein metric.
"
What is the nature of the phase transition in the Hubbard model of the doped antiferromagnet?,"  Cooperation and competition between the antiferromagnetic, d-wave
superconducting and Mott-insulating states are explored for the two-dimensional
Hubbard model including nearest and next-nearest-neighbor hoppings at zero
temperature. Using the variational cluster approach with clusters of different
shapes and sizes up to 10 sites, it is found that the doping-driven transition
from a phase with microscopic coexistence of antiferromagnetism and
superconductivity to a purely superconducting phase is discontinuous for strong
interaction and accompanied by phase separation. At half-filling the system is
in an antiferromagnetic Mott-insulating state with vanishing charge
compressibility. Upon decreasing the interaction strength U below a certain
critical value of roughly U=4 (in units of the nearest-neighbor hopping),
however, the filling-dependent magnetic transition changes its character and
becomes continuous. Phase separation or, more carefully, the tendency towards
the formation of inhomogeneous states disappears. This critical value is in
contrast to previous studies, where a much larger value was obtained. Moreover,
we find that the system at half-filling undergoes the Mott transition from an
insulator to a state with a finite charge compressibility at essentially the
same value. The weakly correlated state at half-filling exhibits
superconductivity microscopically admixed to the antiferromagnetic order. This
scenario suggests a close relation between phase separation and the
Mott-insulator physics.

What are the main steps involved in applying Random-Set Theory to identify active users and estimate their parameters in MUD?,"  In random-access communication systems, the number of active users varies
with time, and has considerable bearing on receiver's performance. Thus,
techniques aimed at identifying not only the information transmitted, but also
that number, play a central role in those systems. An example of application of
these techniques can be found in multiuser detection (MUD). In typical MUD
analyses, receivers are based on the assumption that the number of active users
is constant and known at the receiver, and coincides with the maximum number of
users entitled to access the system. This assumption is often overly
pessimistic, since many users might be inactive at any given time, and
detection under the assumption of a number of users larger than the real one
may impair performance.
  The main goal of this paper is to introduce a general approach to the problem
of identifying active users and estimating their parameters and data in a
random-access system where users are continuously entering and leaving the
system. The tool whose use we advocate is Random-Set Theory: applying this, we
derive optimum receivers in an environment where the set of transmitters
comprises an unknown number of elements. In addition, we can derive
Bayesian-filter equations which describe the evolution with time of the a
posteriori probability density of the unknown user parameters, and use this
density to derive optimum detectors. In this paper we restrict ourselves to
interferer identification and data detection, while in a companion paper we
shall examine the more complex problem of estimating users' parameters.
"
How does the threshold affect the retrieval dynamics of neural networks?,"  The inclusion of a macroscopic adaptive threshold is studied for the
retrieval dynamics of both layered feedforward and fully connected neural
network models with synaptic noise. These two types of architectures require a
different method to be solved numerically. In both cases it is shown that, if
the threshold is chosen appropriately as a function of the cross-talk noise and
of the activity of the stored patterns, adapting itself automatically in the
course of the recall process, an autonomous functioning of the network is
guaranteed. This self-control mechanism considerably improves the quality of
retrieval, in particular the storage capacity, the basins of attraction and the
mutual information content.
"
What are the roles of a single local updating rule for online learning in a continuous-time neural network model?,"  We investigate dynamical systems characterized by a time series of distinct
semi-stable activity patterns, as they are observed in cortical neural activity
patterns. We propose and discuss a general mechanism allowing for an adiabatic
continuation between attractor networks and a specific adjoined transient-state
network, which is strictly dissipative. Dynamical systems with transient states
retain functionality when their working point is autoregulated; avoiding
prolonged periods of stasis or drifting into a regime of rapid fluctuations. We
show, within a continuous-time neural network model, that a single local
updating rule for online learning allows simultaneously (i) for information
storage via unsupervised Hebbian-type learning, (ii) for adaptive regulation of
the working point and (iii) for the suppression of runaway synaptic growth.
Simulation results are presented; the spontaneous breaking of time-reversal
symmetry and link symmetry are discussed.
"
What are the key properties of the proposed criterion?,"  We consider the level of information security provided by random linear
network coding in network scenarios in which all nodes comply with the
communication protocols yet are assumed to be potential eavesdroppers (i.e.
""nice but curious""). For this setup, which differs from wiretapping scenarios
considered previously, we develop a natural algebraic security criterion, and
prove several of its key properties. A preliminary analysis of the impact of
network topology on the overall network coding security, in particular for
complete directed acyclic graphs, is also included.
"
What are the key differences between the characteristics of PbTe p-n-junctions prepared by thermal diffusion of In4Te3 gas and ion implantation of In and Zn?,"  We describe here the characteristics of two types of high-quality PbTe
p-n-junctions, prepared in this work: (1) by thermal diffusion of In4Te3 gas
(TDJ), and (2) by ion implantation (implanted junction, IJ) of In (In-IJ) and
Zn (Zn-IJ). The results, as presented here, demonstrate the high quality of
these PbTe diodes. Capacitance-voltage and current-voltage characteristics have
been measured. The measurements were carried out over a temperature range from
~ 10 K to ~ 180 K. The latter was the highest temperature, where the diode
still demonstrated rectifying properties. This maximum operating temperature is
higher than any of the earlier reported results.
  The saturation current density, J0, in both diode types, was ~ 10^-5 A/cm2 at
80 K, while at 180 K J0 ~ 10^-1 A/cm2 in TDJ and ~ 1 A/cm2 in both
ion-implanted junctions. At 80 K the reverse current started to increase
markedly at a bias of ~ 400 mV for TDJ, and at ~550 mV for IJ. The ideality
factor n was about 1.5-2 for both diode types at 80 K. The analysis of the C-V
plots shows that the junctions in both diode types are linearly graded. The
analysis of the C-V plots allows also determining the height of the junction
barrier, the concentrations and the concentration gradient of the impurities,
and the temperature dependence of the static dielectric constant. The
zero-bias-resistance x area products (R0Ae) at 80 K are: 850 OHMcm2 for TDJ,
250 OHMcm2 for In-IJ, and ~ 80 OHMcm2 for Zn-IJ, while at 180 K R0Ae ~ 0.38
OHMcm2 for TDJ, and ~ 0.1 OHMcm2 for IJ. The estimated detectivity is: D* ~
10^10 cmHz^(1/2)/W up to T=140 K, determined mainly by background radiation,
while at T=180 K, D* decreases to 108-107 cmHz^(1/2)/W, and is determined by
the Johnson noise.
"
What is the relationship between the neutron skin thickness of $^{90}$Zr and the neutron skin thickness of $^{208}$Pb?,"  Charge exchange spin-dipole (SD) excitations of $^{90}$Zr and $^{208}$Pb are
studied by using a Skyrme
  Hartree-Fock(HF) + Random Phase approximation (RPA). The calculated
spin-dipole strength distributions are compared with experimental data obtained
by $^{90}$Zr (p,n) $^{90}$Nb and $^{90}$Zr (n,p) $^{90}$ Nb reactions. The
model-independent SD sum rule values of various Skyrme interactions are studied
in comparison with the experimental values in order to determine the neutron
skin thickness of $^{90}$Zr. The pressure of the neutron matter equation of
state (EOS) and the nuclear matter symmetry energy are discussed in terms of
the neutron skin thickness and peak energies of SD strength distributions.
"
What are the differences between the logarithmic conformal field theory and the other recently proposed logarithmic conformal field theories?,"  The smallest deformation of the minimal model M(2,3) that can accommodate
Cardy's derivation of the percolation crossing probability is presented. It is
shown that this leads to a consistent logarithmic conformal field theory at
c=0. A simple recipe for computing the associated fusion rules is given. The
differences between this theory and the other recently proposed c=0 logarithmic
conformal field theories are underlined. The discussion also emphasises the
existence of invariant logarithmic couplings that generalise Gurarie's anomaly
number.
"
What are the supersymmetric backgrounds of the heterotic string classified?,"  We present the main features of the solution of the gravitino and dilatino
Killing spinor equations derived in hep-th/0510176 and hep-th/0703143 which
have led to the classification of geometric types of all type I backgrounds. We
then apply these results to the supersymmetric backgrounds of the heterotic
string. In particular, we solve the gaugino Killing spinor equation together
with the other two Killing spinor equations of the theory. We also use our
results to classify all supersymmetry conditions of ten-dimensional gauge
theory.
"
What is the relationship between the Liouville model and the new model?,"  Some years ago, Cho and Vilenkin, introduced a model which presents
topological solutions, despite not having degenerate vacua as is usually
expected. Here we present a new model with topological defects, connecting
degenerate vacua but which in a certain limit recovers precisely the one
proposed originally by Cho and Vilenkin. In other words, we found a kind of
parent model for the so called vacuumless model. Then the idea is extended to a
model recently introduced by Bazeia et al. Finally, we trace some comments the
case of the Liouville model.
"
"What are the functorial expressions of the groups Qn(G,H) in terms of enveloping algebras of Lie rings associated with N and T?","  Let $G$ be a group which is the semidirect product of a normal subgroup $N$
and some subgroup $T$. Let $I^n(G)$, $n\ge 1$, denote the powers of the
augmentation ideal $I(G)$ of the group ring $\Z(G)$. Using homological methods
the groups $Q_n(G,H) = I^{n-1}(G)I(H)/I^{n}(G)I(H)$, $H=G,N,T$, are
functorially expressed in terms of enveloping algebras of certain Lie rings
associated with $N$ and $T$, in the following cases: for $n\le 4$ and arbitrary
$G,N,T$ (except from one direct summand of $Q_4(G,N)$), and for all $n\ge 2$ if
certain filtration quotients of $N$ and $T$ are torsionfree.
"
What is the significance of the YSO population in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC)?,"  We use Spitzer Space Telescope observations from the Spitzer Survey of the
Small Magellanic Cloud (S3MC) to study the young stellar content of N66, the
largest and brightest HII region in the SMC. In addition to large numbers of
normal stars, we detect a significant population of bright, red infrared
sources that we identify as likely to be young stellar objects (YSOs). We use
spectral energy distribution (SED) fits to classify objects as ordinary (main
sequence or red giant) stars, asymptotic giant branch stars, background
galaxies, and YSOs. This represents the first large-scale attempt at blind
source classification based on Spitzer SEDs in another galaxy. We firmly
identify at least 61 YSOs, with another 50 probable YSOs; only one embedded
protostar in the SMC was reported in the literature prior to the S3MC. We
present color selection criteria that can be used to identify a relatively
clean sample of YSOs with IRAC photometry. Our fitted SEDs indicate that the
infrared-bright YSOs in N66 have stellar masses ranging from 2 Msun to 17 Msun,
and that approximately half of the objects are Stage II protostars, with the
remaining YSOs roughly evenly divided between Stage I and Stage III sources. We
find evidence for primordial mass segregation in the HII region, with the most
massive YSOs being preferentially closer to the center than lower-mass objects.
Despite the low metallicity and dust content of the SMC, the observable
properties of the YSOs appear consistent with those in the Milky Way. Although
the YSOs are heavily concentrated within the optically bright central region of
N66, there is ongoing star formation throughout the complex and we place a
lower limit on the star formation rate of 3.2 x 10^-3 Msun/yr over the last ~1
Myr.
"
What are the distinct spin wave modes observed in a ferromagnet with finite size?,"  New observations of GD 99 are analysed. The unusual pulsation behaviour,
showing both long and short periods, has been confirmed. All the available
periods show a grouping of short and long period modes with roughly regular
spacing. If we interpret the groups separately, a binary nature can be a
possible explanation as in the similar cases of WD 2350-0054 and G29-38.
"
What are the implications of the coaction crossed-product of C*(\Lambda) by \delta for a (k+1)-graph?,"  Consider a projective limit G of finite groups G_n. Fix a compatible family
\delta^n of coactions of the G_n on a C*-algebra A. From this data we obtain a
coaction \delta of G on A. We show that the coaction crossed product of A by
\delta is isomorphic to a direct limit of the coaction crossed products of A by
the \delta^n.
  If A = C*(\Lambda) for some k-graph \Lambda, and if the coactions \delta^n
correspond to skew-products of \Lambda, then we can say more. We prove that the
coaction crossed-product of C*(\Lambda) by \delta may be realised as a full
corner of the C*-algebra of a (k+1)-graph. We then explore connections with
Yeend's topological higher-rank graphs and their C*-algebras.
"
What is the quantum scalar constraint operator with negative cosmological constant in the FRW model?,"  Open FRW model in Loop Quantum Cosmology is under consideration. The left and
right invariant vector fields and holonomies along them are studied. It is
shown that in the hyperbolic geometry of $k=-1$ it is possible to construct a
suitable loop which provides us with quantum scalar constraint originally
introduced by Vandersloot. The quantum scalar constraint operator with negative
cosmological constant is proved to be essentially self-adjoint.
"
"What is the ""entropy problem"" in the context of non-perturbative theories of quantum gravity?","  Non-perturbative theories of quantum gravity inevitably include
configurations that fail to resemble physically reasonable spacetimes at large
scales. Often, these configurations are entropically dominant and pose an
obstacle to obtaining the desired classical limit. We examine this ""entropy
problem"" in a model of causal set quantum gravity corresponding to a
discretisation of 2D spacetimes. Using results from the theory of partial
orders we show that, in the large volume or continuum limit, its partition
function is dominated by causal sets which approximate to a region of 2D
Minkowski space. This model of causal set quantum gravity thus overcomes the
entropy problem and predicts the emergence of a physically reasonable geometry.
"
What is the mixing-demixing transition in a quasi-two-dimensional boson-fermion mixture (DBFM)?,"  We investigate the mixing-demixing transition and the collapse in a
quasi-two-dimensional degenerate boson-fermion mixture (DBFM) with a bosonic
vortex. We solve numerically a quantum-hydrodynamic model based on a new
density functional which accurately takes into account the dimensional
crossover. It is demonstrated that with the increase of interspecies repulsion,
a mixed state of DBFM could turn into a demixed state. The system collapses for
interspecies attraction above a critical value which depends on the vortex
quantum number. For interspecies attraction just below this critical limit
there is almost complete mixing of boson and fermion components. Such mixed and
demixed states of a DBFM could be experimentally realized by varying an
external magnetic field near a boson-fermion Feshbach resonance, which will
result in a continuous variation of interspecies interaction.
"
What is the definition of the set-indexed fractional Brownian motion?,"  The set-indexed fractional Brownian motion (sifBm) has been defined by
Herbin-Merzbach (2006) for indices that are subsets of a metric measure space.
In this paper, the sifBm is proved to statisfy a strenghtened definition of
increment stationarity. This new definition for stationarity property allows to
get a complete characterization of this process by its fractal properties: The
sifBm is the only set-indexed Gaussian process which is self-similar and has
stationary increments.
  Using the fact that the sifBm is the only set-indexed process whose
projection on any increasing path is a one-dimensional fractional Brownian
motion, the limitation of its definition for a self-similarity parameter
0<H<1/2 is studied, as illustrated by some examples. When the indexing
collection is totally ordered, the sifBm can be defined for 0<H<1.
"
What is the Fermi surface of the conduction electrons in an antiferromagnetic ordered region?,"  We consider the Fermi surface inside the antiferromagnetic ordered region of
a Kondo lattice system in an arbitrary dimension higher than one. We establish
the existence of ${\rm AF_S}$, an antiferromagnetic phase whose Fermi surface
is ``small,'' in the sense that the local moments do not participate in the
Fermi-surface formation. This is in contrast to the ``large'' Fermi surface
that is typically assumed for heavy fermion metals. We extend our earlier work
to the case that the Fermi surface of the conduction electrons intersects the
antiferromagnetic Brillouin zone boundary. Our results provide a new
perspective on local quantum criticality. In addition, our results imply that,
for the ${\rm AF_S}$ phase, it is important to keep track of the dynamical
screening processes; we suggest that this effect is not captured in a recent
variational Monte-Carlo study of the Kondo lattice.
"
What are the implications of the Josephson vortex lattice ground state for the interplane conductivity of underdoped YBa2Cu3Oy?,"  We report on far infrared measurements of interplane conductivity for
underdoped single-crystal YBa2Cu3Oy in magnetic field and situate these new
data within earlier work on two other high-Tc cuprate superconductors,
La(2-x)SrxCuO4 and Bi2Sr2CaCu2O(8+d). The three systems have displayed
apparently disparate electrodynamic responses in the Josephson vortex state
formed when magnetic field H is applied parallel to the CuO2 planes.
Specifically, there is discrepancy in the number and field dependence of
longitudinal modes observed. We compare and contrast these findings with
several models of the electrodynamics in the vortex state and suggest that most
differences can be reconciled through considerations of the Josephson vortex
lattice ground state as well as the c-axis and in-plane quasiparticle
dissipations.
"
What are the implications of a compact Lie group for the class of naturally reductive metrics?,"  We show that within the class of left-invariant naturally reductive metrics
$\mathcal{M}_{\operatorname{Nat}}(G)$ on a compact simple Lie group $G$, every
metric is spectrally isolated. We also observe that any collection of
isospectral compact symmetric spaces is finite; this follows from a somewhat
stronger statement involving only a finite part of the spectrum.
"
What are the velocity probability distribution functions of sheared hard-sphere suspensions?,"  We investigate velocity probability distribution functions (PDF) of sheared
hard-sphere suspensions. As observed in our Stokes flow simulations and
explained by our single-particle theory, these PDFs can show pronounced
deviations from a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution. The PDFs are symmetric around
zero velocity and show a Gaussian core and exponential tails over more than six
orders of magnitude of probability. Following the excellent agreement of our
theory and simulation data, we demonstrate that the distribution functions
scale with the shear rate, the particle volume concentration, as well as the
fluid viscosity.
"
What is the hierarchy of string densities in a string network?,"  We develop velocity-dependent models describing the evolution of string
networks that involve several types of interacting strings, each with a
different tension. These incorporate the formation of Y-type junctions with
links stretching between colliding strings, while always ensuring energy
conservation. These models can be used to describe network evolution for
non-abelian strings as well as cosmic superstrings. The application to $Z_{N}$
strings in which interactions are topologically constrained, demonstrates that
a scaling regime is generally reached which involves a hierarchy of string
densities with the lightest most abundant. We also study hybrid networks of
cosmic superstrings, where energetic considerations are more important in
determining interaction outcomes. We again find that networks tend towards
scaling, with the three lightest network components being dominant and having
comparable number densities, while the heavier string states are suppressed. A
more quantitative analysis depends on the precise calculation of the string
interaction matrix using the underlying string or field theory. Nevertheless,
these results provide further evidence that the presence of junctions in a
string network does not obstruct scaling.
"
What are the consequences of using non-ideal capacitors on other cellular properties such as transmission of high frequencies and voltage attenuation in dendrites?,"  Intracellular recordings of cortical neurons in vivo display intense
subthreshold membrane potential (Vm) activity. The power spectral density (PSD)
of the Vm displays a power-law structure at high frequencies (>50 Hz) with a
slope of about -2.5. This type of frequency scaling cannot be accounted for by
traditional models, as either single-compartment models or models based on
reconstructed cell morphologies display a frequency scaling with a slope close
to -4. This slope is due to the fact that the membrane resistance is
""short-circuited"" by the capacitance for high frequencies, a situation which
may not be realistic. Here, we integrate non-ideal capacitors in cable
equations to reflect the fact that the capacitance cannot be charged
instantaneously. We show that the resulting ""non-ideal"" cable model can be
solved analytically using Fourier transforms. Numerical simulations using a
ball-and-stick model yield membrane potential activity with similar frequency
scaling as in the experiments. We also discuss the consequences of using
non-ideal capacitors on other cellular properties such as the transmission of
high frequencies, which is boosted in non-ideal cables, or voltage attenuation
in dendrites. These results suggest that cable equations based on non-ideal
capacitors should be used to capture the behavior of neuronal membranes at high
frequencies.
"
"What are the types of personal, topical, and commercial websites that respondents have lost, and what are the reasons they have lost this potentially valuable material?","  Internet-based personal digital belongings present different vulnerabilities
than locally stored materials. We use responses to a survey of people who have
recovered lost websites, in combination with supplementary interviews, to paint
a fuller picture of current curatorial strategies and practices. We examine the
types of personal, topical, and commercial websites that respondents have lost
and the reasons they have lost this potentially valuable material. We further
explore what they have tried to recover and how the loss influences their
subsequent practices. We found that curation of personal digital materials in
online stores bears some striking similarities to the curation of similar
materials stored locally in that study participants continue to archive
personal assets by relying on a combination of benign neglect, sporadic
backups, and unsystematic file replication. However, we have also identified
issues specific to Internet-based material: how risk is spread by distributing
the files among multiple servers and services; the circular reasoning
participants use when they discuss the safety of their digital assets; and the
types of online material that are particularly vulnerable to loss. The study
reveals ways in which expectations of permanence and notification are violated
and situations in which benign neglect has far greater consequences for the
long-term fate of important digital assets.
"
What is the timing technique used to obtain precise orbital parameters of accreting millisecond pulsars?,"  We describe a timing technique that allows to obtain precise orbital
parameters of an accreting millisecond pulsar in those cases in which intrinsic
variations of the phase delays (caused e.g. by proper variation of the spin
frequency) with characteristic timescale longer than the orbital period do not
allow to fit the orbital parameters over a long observation (tens of days). We
show under which conditions this method can be applied and show the results
obtained applying this method to the 2003 outburst observed by RXTE of the
accreting millisecond pulsar XTE J1807-294 which shows in its phase delays a
non-negligible erratic behavior. We refined the orbital parameters of XTE
J1807-294 using all the 90 days in which the pulsation is strongly detected and
the method applicable. In this way we obtain the orbital parameters of the
source with a precision more than one order of magnitude better than the
previous available orbital solution, a precision obtained to date, on accreting
millisecond pulsars, only for XTE J1807-294 analyzing several outbursts
spanning over seven years and with a much better statistics.
"
What is the effect of illumination of a strongly coupled superlattice with narrow wells on its dimensionality?,"  We report on magnetotransport measurements in two MBE-grown GaAs/AlGaAs
superlattices formed by wide and narrow quantum wells and thin Si-doped
barriers subject to tilted magnetic fields. It has been shown that illumination
of the strongly coupled superlattice with narrow wells leads to reduction of
its dimensionality from the 3D to 2D. The illumination-induced transition is
revealed by remarkable change of magnetoresistance curves as compared to those
measured before illumination. The experimental data along with tight-binding
model calculations indicate that the illumination not only enhances the
electron concentration but also suppresses the electron tunneling through the
barriers.
"
What is the de Haas-van Alphen effect observed in CeIn3 in magnetic fields?,"  We report measurements of the de Haas-van Alphen effect in CeIn3 in magnetic
fields extending to ~90 T, well above the Ne'el critical field of Hc ~61 T. The
unreconstructed Fermi surface a-sheet is observed in the high magnetic field
polarized paramagnetic limit, but with its effective mass and Fermi surface
volume strongly reduced in size compared to that observed in the low magnetic
field paramagnetic regime under pressure. The spheroidal topology of this sheet
provides an ideal realization of the transformation from a `large Fermi
surface' accommodating f-electrons to a `small Fermi surface' when the
f-electron moments become polarized.
"
How do the authors overcome these challenges and achieve strong coupling between BECs and the cavity mode?,"  An optical cavity enhances the interaction between atoms and light, and the
rate of coherent atom-photon coupling can be made larger than all decoherence
rates of the system. For single atoms, this strong coupling regime of cavity
quantum electrodynamics (cQED) has been the subject of spectacular experimental
advances, and great efforts have been made to control the coupling rate by
trapping and cooling the atom towards the motional ground state, which has been
achieved in one dimension so far. For N atoms, the three-dimensional ground
state of motion is routinely achieved in atomic Bose-Einstein condensates
(BECs), but although first experiments combining BECs and optical cavities have
been reported recently, coupling BECs to strong-coupling cavities has remained
an elusive goal. Here we report such an experiment, which is made possible by
combining a new type of fibre-based cavity with atom chip technology. This
allows single-atom cQED experiments with a simplified setup and realizes the
new situation of N atoms in a cavity each of which is identically and strongly
coupled to the cavity mode. Moreover, the BEC can be positioned
deterministically anywhere within the cavity and localized entirely within a
single antinode of the standing-wave cavity field. This gives rise to a
controlled, tunable coupling rate, as we confirm experimentally. We study the
heating rate caused by a cavity transmission measurement as a function of the
coupling rate and find no measurable heating for strongly coupled BECs. The
spectrum of the coupled atoms-cavity system, which we map out over a wide range
of atom numbers and cavity-atom detunings, shows vacuum Rabi splittings
exceeding 20 gigahertz, as well as an unpredicted additional splitting which we
attribute to the atomic hyperfine structure.
"
What are the two genetic algorithms used to optimize three instances of this topology control problem?,"  This work aims at optimizing injection networks, which consist in adding a
set of long-range links (called bypass links) in mobile multi-hop ad hoc
networks so as to improve connectivity and overcome network partitioning. To
this end, we rely on small-world network properties, that comprise a high
clustering coefficient and a low characteristic path length. We investigate the
use of two genetic algorithms (generational and steady-state) to optimize three
instances of this topology control problem and present results that show
initial evidence of their capacity to solve it.
"
What are the implications of MOND for the study of galaxy clusters and galaxy clusters?,"  We present the results of N-body simulations of dissipationless galaxy
merging in Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND). For comparison, we also studied
Newtonian merging between galaxies embedded in dark matter halos, with internal
dynamics equivalent to the MOND systems. We found that the merging timescales
are significantly longer in MOND than in Newtonian gravity with dark matter,
suggesting that observational evidence of rapid merging could be difficult to
explain in MOND. However, when two galaxies eventually merge, the MOND merging
end-product is hardly distinguishable from the final stellar distribution of an
equivalent Newtonian merger with dark matter.
"
How does the analysis of networks relate to the development dynamics of the networks?,"  In this work we propose the use of a hirarchical extension of the
polygonality index as a means to characterize and model geographical networks:
each node is associated with the spatial position of the nodes, while the edges
of the network are defined by progressive connectivity adjacencies. Through the
analysis of such networks, while relating its topological and geometrical
properties, it is possible to obtain important indications about the
development dynamics of the networks under analysis. The potential of the
methodology is illustrated with respect to synthetic geographical networks.
"
What are the distinct spin wave modes in a ferromagnet with finite size?,"  Two identical 1D autocatalytic systems with Gray--Scott kinetics--driven
towards convectively unstable regimes and submitted to independent
spatiotemporal Gaussian white noises--are coupled unidirectionally, but
otherwise linearly. Numerical simulation then reveals that (even when perturbed
by noise) the slave system replicates the convective patterns arising in the
master one to a very high degree of precision, as indicated by several measures
of synchronization.
"
What is the propagation of ultra-relativistic blastwaves through the circumburst medium simulated in this study?,"  Context:A significant fraction of progenitors for long gamma-ray bursts
(GRBs) are believed to be massive stars. The investigation of long GRBs
therefore requires modeling the propagation of ultra-relativistic blastwaves
through the circumburst medium surrounding massive stars. We simulate the
expansion of an isotropic, adiabatic relativistic fireball into the wind-shaped
medium around a massive GRB progenitor. The circumburst medium is composed of a
realistically stratified stellar wind zone up to its termination shock,
followed by a region of shocked wind characterized by a constant density. Aims:
We followed the evolution of the blastwave through all its stages, including
the extremely rapid acceleration up to a Lorentz factor 75 flow, its
deceleration by interaction with stellar wind, its passage of the wind
termination shock, until its propagation through shocked wind. Methods: We used
the adaptive mesh refinement versatile advection code to follow the evolution
of the fireball. Results: We show that the acceleration from purely thermal to
ultra-relativistic kinetic regimes is abrupt and produces an internally
structured blastwave. We resolved the structure of this ultra-relativistic
shell in all stages, thanks to the adaptive mesh. We comment on the dynamical
roles played by forward and reverse shock pairs in the phase of interaction
with the free stellar wind and clearly identify the complex shock-dominated
structure created when the shell crosses the terminal shock. Conclusion: We
show that in our model where the terminal shock is taken relatively close to
the massive star, the phase of self-similar deceleration of Blandford-McKee
type can only be produced in the constant density, shocked wind zone.
"
What are the main results of the HERA experiments?,"  Recent results from HERA are presented. The main reviewed subjects are
polarized DIS cross sections, parton density determination, diffractive PDFs,
multi-jet production and searches for physics beyond the Standard Model.
"
What is the relationship between Cuntz-Pimsner algebras and partial isometric crossed products?,"  The article discusses the interrelation between relative Cuntz-Pimsner
algebras and partial isometric crossed products, and presents a procedure that
reduces any given Hilbert bimodule to the ""smallest"" Hilbert bimodule yielding
the same relative Cuntz-Pimsner algebra as the initial one. In the context of
crossed products this reduction procedure corresponds to reduction of
C*-dynamical systems.
"
What is the significance of the distinction between the different spin wave modes in a ferromagnet with finite size?,"  In this talk we briefly summarize our theoretical understanding of in-medium
selfenergies of hadrons. With the special case of the $\omega$ meson we
demonstrate that earlier calculations that predicted a significant lowering of
the mass in medium are based on an incorrect treatment of the model Lagrangian;
more consistent calculations lead to a significant broadening, but hardly any
mass shift. We stress that the experimental reconstruction of hadron spectral
functions from measured decay products always requires knowledge of the decay
branching ratios which may also be strongly mass-dependent. It also requires a
quantitatively reliable treatment of final state interactions which has to be
part of any reliable theory.
"
What is the correction term for the interaction potential introduced in the observed level structure?,"  Asymptotic levels of the A $^1\Sigma_u^+$ state of the two isotopomers
$^{39}{\rm K}_2$ and $^{39}{\rm K}^{41}{\rm K}$ up to the dissociation limit
are investigated with a Doppler-free high resolution laser-spectroscopic
experiment in a molecular beam. The observed level structure can be reproduced
correctly only if a mass dependent correction term is introduced for the
interaction potential. The applied relative correction in the depth of the
potential is $10^{-6}$, which is in the order of magnitude expected for
corrections of the Born-Oppenheimer approximation. A similar change in ground
state potentials might lead to significant changes of mass-scaled properties
describing cold collisions like the s-wave scattering length.

What is the boundary topology for the black holes in question?,"  We study phase transition between electrically charged Ricci-flat black holes
and AdS soliton spacetime of Horowitz and Myers in five dimensions. Boundary
topology for both of them is $S^1 \times S^1 \times R^2$. We consider
Reissner-Nordstrom black hole and R-charged black holes and find that phase
transition of these black holes to AdS soliton spacetime depends on the
relative size of two boundary circles. We also perform the stability analysis
for these black holes. In order to use the AdS/CFT correspondence, we work in
the grand canonical ensemble.
"
What are the equations governing the distribution of work done on a system out of equilibrium by external manipulation?,"  We review and discuss the equations governing the distribution of work done
on a system which is driven out of equilibrium by external manipulation, as
well as those governing the entropy flow to a reservoir in a nonequilibrium
system. We take advantage of these equations to investigate the path phase
transition in a manipulated mean-field Ising model and the large-deviation
function for the heat flow in the asymmetric exclusion process with
periodically varying transition probabilities.
"
What is the origin of the scale in quantum mechanical models of a free particle?,"  We show that the intriguing localization of a free particle wave-packet is
possible due to a hidden scale present in the system. Self-adjoint extensions
(SAE) is responsible for introducing this scale in quantum mechanical models
through the nontrivial boundary conditions. We discuss a couple of classically
scale invariant free particle systems to illustrate the issue. In this context
it has been shown that a free quantum particle moving on a full line may have
localized wave-packet around the origin. As a generalization, it has also been
shown that particles moving on a portion of a plane or on a portion of a three
dimensional space can have unusual localized wave-packet.
"
What are the strain and relaxation of Al2O3 growth on Nb (110) observed at different stages?,"  We report on the layer-by-layer growth of single-crystal Al2O3 thin-films on
Nb (110). Single-crystal Nb films are first prepared on A-plane sapphire,
followed by the evaporation of Al in an O2 background. The first stages of
Al2O3 growth are layer-by-layer with hexagonal symmetry. Electron and x-ray
diffraction measurements indicate the Al2O3 initially grows clamped to the Nb
lattice with a tensile strain near 10%. This strain relaxes with further
deposition, and beyond about 5 nm we observe the onset of island growth.
Despite the asymmetric misfit between the Al2O3 film and the Nb under-layer,
the observed strain is surprisingly isotropic.
"
What is the effective area that can be achieved with an optimized design of the XEUS telescope?,"  We describe measurements of the X-ray reflectance in the range 2 to 10 keV of
samples representative of coated silicon wafers that are proposed for the
fabrication of the XEUS (X-ray Evolving Universe Spectrometer) mission. We
compare the reflectance of silicon samples coated with bare Pt, with that for
samples with an additional 10nm thick carbon over-coating. We demonstrate a
significant improvement in reflectance in the energy range ~1 to 4 keV, and at
a grazing incidence angle of 10 mrad (0.57 degrees). We consider the resulting
effective area that could be attained with an optimized design of the XEUS
telescope. Typically an improvement of 10 to 60 % in effective area, depending
on photon energy, can be achieved using the carbon overcoat.
"
How does the resolved SFR vs gas surface density relation compare to the disk-averaged Schmidt law in the spiral galaxy M51a (NGC 5194)?,"  We have studied the relationship between the star formation rate (SFR)
surface density and gas surface density in the spiral galaxy M51a (NGC 5194),
using multi-wavelength data obtained as part of the Spitzer Infrared Nearby
Galaxies Survey (SINGS). We introduce a new SFR index based on a linear
combination of H-alpha emission-line and 24 micron continuum luminosities, that
provides reliable extinction-corrected ionizing fluxes and SFR densities over a
wide range of dust attenuations. The combination of these extinction-corrected
SFR densities with aperture synthesis HI and CO maps has allowed us to probe
the form of the spatially-resolved star formation law on scales of 0.5 to 2
kpc. We find that the resolved SFR vs gas surface density relation is well
represented by a Schmidt power law, which is similar in form and dispersion to
the disk-averaged Schmidt law. We observe a comparably strong correlation of
the SFR surface density with the molecular gas surface density, but no
significant correlation with the surface density of atomic gas. The
best-fitting slope of the Schmidt law varies from N = 1.37 to 1.56, with
zeropoint and slope that change systematically with the spatial sampling scale.
We tentatively attribute these variations to the effects of areal sampling and
averaging of a nonlinear intrinsic star formation law. Our data can also be
fitted by an alternative parametrization of the SFR surface density in terms of
the ratio of gas surface density to local dynamical time, but with a
considerable dispersion.
"
What is the role of local translational symmetry in gauge theories?,"  We analyze the role played by local translational symmetry in the context of
gauge theories of fundamental interactions. Translational connections and
fields are introduced, with special attention being paid to their universal
coupling to other variables, as well as to their contributions to field
equations and to conserved quantities.
"
What is the method used to model the atmosphere of a metal-rich white dwarf star?,"  We present PHOENIX atmosphere models for metal-rich cool white dwarfs using
improved line shapes for the Na I and K I resonance doublets. Profiles for
collisional broadening due to H2 and He based on the adiabatic representation
show strong deviations from Van der Waals interaction at short distances.
Comparison with observed spectra that show extremely broadened Na I lines
indicates that a He-rich atmospheric composition is required to explain the
line strengths and spectral energy distributions. Our current synthetic
spectra, using an expansion in powers of density to the third order optimised
for brown dwarf atmosphere conditions, significantly underestimate the observed
absorption in the far wings, even predicting smaller total line strength than a
Lorentzian profile. This is due to the handling of multiple perturber
interactions becoming inadequate for the extreme densities of the coolest white
dwarfs. The density expansion would have to be extended at least to the 7th
order for an accurate treatment of such conditions and might break down
altogether in the densest objects. The results of a direct calculation of the
unified profile should therefore be used for model atmospheres of cool
metal-rich white dwarfs. Qualitative comparison of the full adiabatic profile
to the spectrum of WD2356-209 indicates good agreement with the observed line
shape. Observations of the coolest white dwarfs may therefore serve as a
laboratory for testing the physics of the deeper atmospheres and interiors of
brown dwarfs and giant planets.
"
What is the impact of the RpA ratio on the forward rapidity distribution?,"  We predict that the RpA ratio at the most forward rapidities to be measured
at LHC should be strongly suppressed, close to ""total shadowing'' (RpA =
A^(-1/3)), as a consequence of running coupling effects in the nonlinear QCD
evolution.
"
What is the relationship between the Higgs boson masses and the CKM mixing angles?,"  We propose that the CP violating phase in the CKM mixing matrix is identical
to the CP phases responsible for the spontaneous CP violation in the Higgs
potential. A specific multi-Higgs model with Peccei-Quinn (PQ) symmetry is
constructed to realize this idea. The CP violating phase does not vanish when
all Higgs masses become large. There are flavor changing neutral current (FCNC)
interactions mediated by neutral Higgs bosons at the tree level. However,
unlike general multi-Higgs models, the FCNC Yukawa couplings are fixed in terms
of the quark masses and CKM mixing angles. Implications for meson-anti-meson
mixing, including recent data on $D-\bar D$ mixing, and neutron electric dipole
moment (EDM) are studied. We find that the neutral Higgs boson masses can be at
the order of one hundred GeV. The neutron EDM can be close to the present
experimental upper bound.
"
What is the range of thickness for phase change in epitaxial Ba0.5Sr0.5TiO3 films?,"  Epitaxial Ba0.5Sr0.5TiO3 thin films were prepared on Nb-doped SrTiO3
(100)substrates by the pulsed laser deposition technique, and were studied by
measuring the Ti 2p - 3d resonant photoemission spectra in the valence-band
region as a function of film thickness, both at room temperature and low
temperature. Our results demonstrated an abrupt variation in the spectral
structures between 2.8 nm (~7 monolayers) and 2.0 nm (~5 monolayers)
Ba0.5Sr0.5TiO3 films, suggesting that there exists a critical thickness for
phase change in the range of 2.0 nm to 2.8 nm. This may be ascribed mainly to
the intrinsic size effects.
"
What is the relationship between the growth of supermassive black holes and the evolution of galaxies in the simulated cosmological structure formation?,"  We investigate the coupled formation and evolution of galaxies and their
embedded supermassive black holes using state-of-the-art hydrodynamic
simulations of cosmological structure formation. For the first time, we
self-consistently follow the dark matter dynamics, radiative gas cooling, star
formation, as well as black hole growth and associated feedback processes,
starting directly from initial conditions appropriate for the LambdaCDM
cosmology. Our modeling of the black hole physics is based on an approach we
have developed in simulations of isolated galaxy mergers. Here we examine: (i)
the predicted global history of black hole mass assembly (ii) the evolution of
the local black hole-host mass correlations and (iii) the conditions that allow
rapid growth of the first quasars, and the properties of their hosts and
descendants today. We find a total black hole mass density in good agreement
with observational estimates. The black hole accretion rate density peaks at
lower redshift and evolves more strongly at high redshift than the star
formation rate density, but the ratio of black hole to stellar mass densities
shows only a moderate evolution at low redshifts. We find strong correlations
between black hole masses and properties of the stellar systems, agreeing well
with the measured local M_BH-sigma and M_BH -M_* relationships, but also
suggesting (dependent on the mass range) a weak evolution with redshift in the
normalization and the slope. Our simulations also produce massive black holes
at high redshift, due to extended periods of exponential growth in regions that
collapse early and exhibit strong gas inflows. These first supermassive BH
systems however are not necessarily the most massive ones today, since they are
often overtaken in growth by quasars that form later. (abridged)
"
What is the relationship between the mean square displacement and the average loop configuration?,"  While the structure of chromatin has been studied in great detail on length
scales below 30 nm, amazingly little is known about the higher-order folding
motifs of chromatin in interphase. Recent experiments give evidence that the
folding may depend locally on gene density and transcriptional activity and
show a leveling-off at long distances where approximately $<R^2> \sim O(1)$. We
propose a new model that can explain this leveling-off by the formation of
random loops. We derive an analytical expression for the mean square
displacement between two beads where the average is taken over the thermal
ensemble with a fixed but random loop configuration, while quenched averaging
over the ensemble of different loop configurations -- which turns out to be
equivalent to averaging over an ensemble of random matrices -- is performed
numerically. A detailed investigation of this model shows that loops on all
scales are necessary to fit experimental data.
"
How do photometric measurements of transit timing variations help to determine the density ratio of a satellite and a planet?,"  Precise photometric measurements of the upcoming space missions allow the
size, mass, and density of satellites of exoplanets to be determined. Here we
present such an analysis using the photometric transit timing variation
($TTV_p$). We examined the light curve effects of both the transiting planet
and its satellite. We define the photometric central time of the transit that
is equivalent to the transit of a fixed photocenter. This point orbits the
barycenter, and leads to the photometric transit timing variations. The exact
value of $TTV_p$ depends on the ratio of the density, the mass, and the size of
the satellite and the planet. Since two of those parameters are independent, a
reliable estimation of the density ratio leads to an estimation of the size and
the mass of the exomoon. Upper estimations of the parameters are possible in
the case when an upper limit of $TTV_p$ is known. In case the density ratio
cannot be estimated reliably, we propose an approximation with assuming equal
densities. The presented photocenter $TTV_p$ analysis predicts the size of the
satellite better than the mass. We simulated transits of the Earth-Moon system
in front of the Sun. The estimated size and mass of the Moon are 0.020
Earth-mass and 0.274 Earth-size if equal densities are assumed. This result is
comparable to the real values within a factor of 2. If we include the real
density ratio (about 0.6), the results are 0.010 Earth-Mass and 0.253
Earth-size, which agree with the real values within 20%.
"
What is the relationship between the fine structure constant and the recombination redshift?,"  This paper presents the constraints on the time variation of the fine
structure constant at recombination relative to its present value, Delta_alpha
= (alpha_rec-alpha_0) / alpha_0, obtained from the analysis of the WMAP-3yr
Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data, with an additional prior on the Hubble
expansion rate from HST Hubble Key Project. I found out that -0.039 <
Delta_alpha < 0.010 at 95% C.L., which brings a 30% improvement to the previous
limits from WMAP-1yr data. The corresponding recombination redshift, 1012 <
z_rec < 1115, shows a delayed recombination epoch compared with the results
from WMAP-1yr data.
"
What are the low-frequency/high-efficiency modes observed in lanthanum adatoms?,"  In low temperature scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) experiments a cerium
adatom on Ag(100) possesses two discrete states with significantly different
apparent heights. These atomic switches also exhibit a Kondo-like feature in
spectroscopy experiments. By extensive theoretical simulations we find that
this behavior is due to diffusion of hydrogen from the surface onto the Ce
adatom in the presence of the STM tip field. The cerium adatom possesses
vibrational modes of very low energy (3-4meV) and very high efficiency (> 20%),
which are due to the large changes of Ce-states in the presence of hydrogen.
The atomic vibrations lead to a Kondo-like feature at very low bias voltages.
We predict that the same low-frequency/high-efficiency modes can also be
observed at lanthanum adatoms.
"
How can the information about generic U(1)^r GLSMs be obtained?,"  We systematically study the phases of generic toric singularities, using
methods initiated in hep-th/0612046. These correspond to Gauged Linear Sigma
Models with arbitrary charges. We show that complete information about generic
$U(1)^r$ GLSMs can be obtained by studying the GLSM Lagrangian, appropriately
modified in the different phases of the theory. This can be used to study the
different phases of $L^{a,b,c}$ spaces and their non-supersymmetric
counterparts.
"
What is the relation between the Friedmann cosmology and the Ricci curvature in the braneworld scenario?,"  We construct a DGP inspired braneworld scenario where a scalar field
non-minimally coupled to the induced Ricci curvature is present on the brane.
We show that this model allows for an embedding of the standard Friedmann
cosmology in the sense that the cosmological evolution of the background metric
on the brane can be described by the standard Friedmann equation. The relation
between our framework and the dark-energy formalism is explored.
"
What are the status of other searches for bursts of radiation from unknown sources?,"  We present recent results from searches by the LIGO Science Collaboration for
bursts of gravitational-wave radiation, as well as the status of other ongoing
searches. These include directed searches for bursts associated with observed
sources (gamma-ray bursts, soft gamma repeaters) and untriggered searches for
bursts from unknown sources. We also present the status of some newer
investigations, such as coherent network methods. We show methods for
interpreting our search results in terms of astrophysical source distributions
that improve their accessibility to the wider community.
"
What are the characteristics of the surface plasmon polaritons in metallic films?,"  It is theoretically shown that nanometric silver lamellar gratings present
very strong visible light absorption inside the grooves, leading to electric
field intensities by several orders of magnitude larger than that of the
impinging light. This effect, due to the excitation of long wave vector surface
plasmon polaritons with particular small penetration depth in the metal, may
explain the abnormal optical absorption observed a long time ago on almost flat
Ag films. Surface enhanced Raman scattering in rough metallic films could also
be due to the excitation of such plasmon polaritons in the grain boundaries or
notches of the films.
"
What are the two simplifications used in the particle filter construction?,"  We present a particle filter construction for a system that exhibits
time-scale separation. The separation of time-scales allows two simplifications
that we exploit: i) The use of the averaging principle for the dimensional
reduction of the system needed to solve for each particle and ii) the
factorization of the transition probability which allows the
Rao-Blackwellization of the filtering step. Both simplifications can be
implemented using the coarse projective integration framework. The resulting
particle filter is faster and has smaller variance than the particle filter
based on the original system. The method is tested on a multiscale stochastic
differential equation and on a multiscale pure jump diffusion motivated by
chemical reactions.
"
What is the pulsed laser ablation technique used to control the growth of GaAs nanowires?,"  Using pulsed laser ablation with arsenic over pressure, the growth conditions
for GaAs nanowires have been systematically investigated and optimized. Arsenic
over pressure with As$_2$ molecules was introduced to the system by thermal
decomposition of polycrystalline GaAs to control the stoichiometry and shape of
the nanowires during growth. GaAs nanowires exhibit a variety of geometries
under varying arsenic over pressure, which can be understood by different
growth processes via vapor-liquid-solid mechanism. Single-crystal GaAs
nanowires with uniform diameter, lengths over 20 $\mu$m, and thin surface oxide
layer were obtained and can potentially be used for further electronic
characterization.
"
What is the Richardson-Littlewood criterion used to determine the vanishing coupling coefficients for subduction representations?,"  This paper is concerned with the subduction problem of type A quantum
Iwahori-Hecke algebras $\mathbb{C} \mathbf{H}(\mathfrak{S}_f,q^2)$ with a real
deformation parameter $q$, i.e. the problem of decomposing irreducible
representations of such algebras as direct sum of irreducible representations
of the subalgebras $\mathbb{C}\mathbf{H}(\mathfrak{S}_{f_1}, q^2) \times
\mathbb{C}\mathbf{H}(\mathfrak{S}_{f_2}, q^2)$, with $f_1 + f_2 = f$. After
giving a suitable combinatorial description for the subduction issue, we
provide a selection rule, based on the Richardson-Littlewood criterion, which
allows to determine the vanishing coupling coefficients between standard basis
vectors for such representations, and we also present an equivariance condition
for the subduction coefficients. Such results extend those ones corresponding
to the subduction problem in symmetric group algebras $\mathbb{C}\mathfrak{S}_f
\downarrow \mathbb{C}\mathfrak{S}_{f_1} \times \mathbb{C} \mathfrak{S}_{f_2}$
which are obtained by $q$ approaching the value 1.
"
What are the spatial associations between interstellar neutral hydrogen (HI) emission morphology and small-scale structure observed by the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP)?,"  Spatial associations have been found between interstellar neutral hydrogen
(HI) emission morphology and small-scale structure observed by the Wilkinson
Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) in an area bounded by l = 60 & 180 deg, b =
30 & 70 deg, which was the primary target for this study. This area is marked
by the presence of highly disturbed local HI and a preponderance of
intermediate- and high-velocity gas. The HI distribution toward the brightest
peaks in the WMAP Internal Linear Combination (ILC) map for this area is
examined and by comparing with a second area on the sky it is demonstrated that
the associations do not appear to be the result of chance coincidence. Close
examination of several of the associations reveals important new properties of
diffuse interstellar neutral hydrogen structure. In the case of high-velocity
cloud MI, the HI and WMAP ILC morphologies are similar and an excess of soft
X-ray emission and H-alpha emission have been reported for this feature. It is
suggested that the small angular-scale, high frequency continuum emission
observed by WMAP may be produced at the surfaces of HI features interacting one
another, or at the interface between moving HI structures and regions of
enhanced plasma density in the surrounding interstellar medium. It is possible
that dust grains play a role in producing the emission. However, the primary
purpose of this report is to draw attention to these apparent associations
without offering an unambiguous explanation as to the relevant emission
mechanism(s).
"
What are the energy transfer rates in a 10d setup as a function of the AdS scales of throats and their relative distance?,"  Strongly warped regions, also known as throats, are a common feature of the
type IIB string theory landscape. If one of the throats is heated during
cosmological evolution, the energy is subsequently transferred to other throats
or to massless fields in the unwarped bulk of the Calabi-Yau orientifold. This
energy transfer proceeds either by Hawking radiation from the black hole
horizon in the heated throat or, at later times, by the decay of
throat-localized Kaluza-Klein states. In both cases, we calculate in a 10d
setup the energy transfer rate (respectively decay rate) as a function of the
AdS scales of the throats and of their relative distance. Compared to existing
results based on 5d models, we find a significant suppression of the energy
transfer rates if the size of the embedding Calabi-Yau orientifold is much
larger than the AdS radii of the throats. This effect can be partially
compensated by a small distance between the throats. These results are
relevant, e.g., for the analysis of reheating after brane inflation. Our
calculation employs the dual gauge theory picture in which each throat is
described by a strongly coupled 4d gauge theory, the degrees of freedom of
which are localized at a certain position in the compact space.
"
What is the formula for the particle current density in the 2D k-cubic Rashba spin-orbit coupling system?,"  We study the extra term of particle current in a 2D k-cubic Rashba spin-orbit
coupling system and the integer quantization of the Hall conductance in this
system. We provide a correct formula of charge current in this system and the
careful consideration of extra currents provides a stronger theoretical basis
for the theory of the quantum Hall effect which has not been considered before.
The non-trivial extra contribution to the particle current density and local
conductivity, which originates from the cubic dependence on the momentum
operator in the Hamiltonian, will have no effect on the integer quantization of
the Hall conductance. The extension of Noether's theorem for the 2D k-cubic
Rashba system is also addressed. The two methods reach to exactly the same
results.
"
What are the scalar field interactions with defects and their propagation?,"  An algebraic framework for quantization in presence of arbitrary number of
point-like defects on the line is developed. We consider a scalar field which
interacts with the defects and freely propagates away of them. As an
application we compute the Casimir force both at zero and finite temperature.
We derive also the charge density in the Gibbs state of a complex scalar field
with defects. The example of two delta-defects is treated in detail.
"
What is the relationship between the neutrino-less double beta decay of the standard model and the neutrino-less double beta decay of the standard model?,"  It is demonstrated that the standard-model Lagrangian with a Majorana mass
term for the neutrino admits no non-trivial solution. Because the standard
model is generally believed to describe the gauge interactions of neutrinos
correctly, the Majorana mass term must vanish and thus cannot enable
neutrino-less double beta decay. More generally, neutrinos with standard-model
gauge interactions cannot be Majorana fields. Historical reasons why this
conclusion has not been drawn earlier are analyzed.
"
What are the candidates selected for follow-up observations?,"  The SuperWASP-I instrument observed 6.7 million stars between 8-15 mag from
La Palma during the 2004 May-September season. Our transit-hunting algorithm
selected 11,626 objects from the 184,442 stars within the range RA 18hr-21hr.
We describe our thorough selection procedure whereby catalogue information is
exploited along with careful study of the SuperWASP data to filter out, as far
as possible, transit mimics. We have identified 35 candidates which we
recommend for follow-up observations.
"
What is the relationship between the subhalo population and the halo formation time in galaxy clusters?,"  We use large cosmological N-body simulations to study the subhalo population
in galaxy group sized halos. In particular, we look for fossil group candidates
with typical masses ~10-25% of Virgo cluster but with an order of magnitude
less substructure. We examine recent claims that the earliest systems to form
are deficient enough in substructure to explain the luminosity function found
in fossil groups. Although our simulations show a correlation between the halo
formation time and the number of subhalos, the maximum suppression of subhalos
is a factor of 2-2.5, whereas a factor of 6 is required to match fossil groups
and galaxies. While the number of subhalos depends weakly on the formation
time, the slope of the halo substructure velocity function does not. The
satellite population within Cold Dark Matter (CDM) halos is self-similar at
scales between galaxies and galaxy clusters regardless of mass, whereas current
observations show a break in self-similarity at a mass scale corresponding to
group of galaxies.

"
What is the Collins fragmentation function used in the framework of a spectator model?,"  We calculate the Collins fragmentation function in the framework of a
spectator model with pseudoscalar pion-quark coupling and a Gaussian form
factor at the vertex. We determine the model parameters by fitting the
unpolarized fragmentation function for pions and kaons. We show that the
Collins function for the pions in this model is in reasonable agreement with
recent parametrizations obtained by fits of the available data. In addition, we
compute for the first time the Collins function for the kaons.
"
What are the properties of the coexisting spin and charge Kondo state in a triple quantum dot (TQD) system?,"  Using Wilson's numerical renormalization group (NRG) technique we compute
zero-bias conductance and various correlation functions of a double quantum dot
(DQD) system. We present different regimes within a phase diagram of the DQD
system. By introducing a negative Hubbard U on one of the quantum dots, we
simulate the effect of electron-phonon coupling and explore the properties of
the coexisting spin and charge Kondo state. In a triple quantum dot (TQD)
system a multi-stage Kondo effect appears where localized moments on quantum
dots are screened successively at exponentially distinct Kondo temperatures.
"
What is the workspace topology of a 3R manipulator characterized by the number of cusps on the singular curves?,"  The workspace topologies of a family of 3-revolute (3R) positioning
manipulators are enumerated. The workspace is characterized in a half-cross
section by the singular curves. The workspace topology is defined by the number
of cusps that appear on these singular curves. The design parameters space is
shown to be divided into five domains where all manipulators have the same
number of cusps. Each separating surface is given as an explicit expression in
the DH-parameters. As an application of this work, we provide a necessary and
sufficient condition for a 3R orthogonal manipulator to be cuspidal, i.e. to
change posture without meeting a singularity. This condition is set as an
explicit expression in the DH parameters.
"
What are the explicit numerical calculations and formula for obtaining the solutions of ADAFs presented in this paper?,"  We present the basic equations and sample solutions for the steady-state
global transonic solutions of the advection-dominated accretion flows (ADAFs)
with a causal viscosity prescription. The procedures for the stable numerical
calculations and all explicit formula for obtaining the solutions of ADAFs are
also presented. We solve the transonic solutions of ADAFs by using the explicit
numerical integrations, as in the Runge-Kutta method. In this calculation
method, we first solve the physical values at the sonic radius where
L'Hopital's rule is used. Then, we numerically solve the coupled differential
equations of the radial velocity, the angular momentum, and the sound speed
from the sonic radius in the inward and outward directions. By the calculation
procedures presented in this paper, we can cover all parameter spaces of the
transonic solutions of ADAFs. Sample transonic solutions for ADAF-thick disk
and ADAF-thin disk are presented. The explicit formula for the analytical
expansion around the singular points, the sonic and the viscous points, are
presented. If we set the diffusion timescale to null, the formalism in this
study becomes the formalism of the acausal viscosity that is usually used in
past studies for calculating of the ADAF structure.
"
What is the mechanism to amplify seed fields to microgauss strengths?,"  We review the literature concerning how the cosmic magnetic fields pervading
nearly all galaxies actually got started. some observational evidence involves
the chemical abundance of the light elements Be and B, while another one is
based on strong magnetic fields seen in high red shift galaxies. Seed fields,
whose strength is of order 10^{-20} gauss, easily sprung up in the era
preceding galaxy formation. Several mechanisms are proposed to amplify these
seed fields to microgauss strengths. The standard mechanism is the Alpha-Omega
dynamo theory. It has a major difficulty that makes unlikely to provide the
sole origin. The difficulty is rooted in the fact that the total flux is
constant. This implies that flux must be removed from the galactic discs. This
requires that the field and flux be separated, for otherwise interstellar mass
must be removed from the deep galactic gravitational and then their strength
increased by the alpha omega theory.
"
What are the factors that are relevant to extract from a lattice computation the decay constants of the static-light currents?,"  The analytical expressions and the numerical values of the renormalisation
constants of ${\cal O}(a)$ improved static-light currents are given at one-loop
order of perturbation theory in the framework of Heavy Quark Effective Theory:
the static quark is described by the HYP action and the light quark is
described either with the Clover or the Neuberger action. These factors are
relevant to extract from a lattice computation the decay constants $f_B$,
$f_{B_S}$ and the set of bag parameters $B_i$ associated with $B-\bar{B}$
mixing phenomenology in the Standard Model and beyond.
"
What are the main results of the perturbation theory of holomorphic curves in exploded torus fibrations?,"  Initiated by Gromov, the study of holomorphic curves in symplectic manifolds
has been a powerfull tool in symplectic topology, however the moduli space of
holomorphic curves is often very difficult to find. A common technique is to
study the limiting behavior of holomorphic curves in a degenerating family of
complex structures which corresponds to a kind of adiabatic limit. The category
of exploded fibrations is an extension of the smooth category in which some of
these degenerations can be described as smooth families.
  The first part of this paper is devoted to defining exploded fibrations and a
slightly more specialized category of exploded torus fibrations. Later sections
contain the transverse interesction theory for exploded fibrations and some
examples of holomorphic curves in exploded torus fibrations, including a brief
discussion of the relationship between tropical geometry and exploded torus
fibrations. In the final section, the perturbation theory of holomorphic curves
in exploded torus fibrations is sketched.
"
What is the relationship between the scale of the baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) and the equation-of-state parameter of the dark energy?,"  The measurement of the scale of the baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) in the
galaxy power spectrum as a function of redshift is a promising method to
constrain the equation-of-state parameter of the dark energy w. To measure the
scale of the BAO precisely, a substantial volume of space must be surveyed. We
test whether light-cone effects are important and whether the scaling relations
used to compensate for an incorrect reference cosmology are in this case
sufficiently accurate. We investigate the degeneracies in the cosmological
parameters and the benefits of using the two-dimensional anisotropic power
spectrum. Finally, we estimate the uncertainty with which w can be measured by
proposed surveys at redshifts of about z=3 and z=1, respectively.
  In the simulated survey we find that light-cone effects are small and that
the simple scaling relations used to correct for the cosmological distortion
work fairly well even for large survey volumes. The analysis of the
two-dimensional anisotropic power spectra enables an independent determination
to be made of the apparent scale of the BAO, perpendicular and parallel to the
line of sight. This is essential for two-parameter w-models, such as the
redshift-dependent dark energy model w=w_0+(1-a)w_a. Using Planck priors for
the matter and baryon density and Delta(H_0)=5% for the Hubble constant, we
estimate that the BAO measurements of future surveys around z=3 and z=1 will be
able to constrain, independently of other cosmological probes, a constant w to
~ 12% and ~ 11% (68% c.l.), respectively.

What is the density matrix renormalization group technique used to construct exact ground state exchange correlation functionals?,"  A method is presented, which employs the density matrix renormalization group
technique in order to construct exact ground state exchange correlation
functionals for models of correlated electron systems coupled to external
reservoirs. The technique is applied to the M-site resonant level model. We
calculate its exact Kubo-conductance, which is available within DMRG, and
compare to the single-particle conductance obtained from Kohn-Sham energies and
orbitals of the exact ground state density functional theory (DFT). It is found
that the position of transport resonances is reproduced essentially exactly,
while deviations in the level broadening can be less than 1% and do not exceed
10%. Our findings lend strong support to a recently held point of view, namely
that approximations in the ground state functionals used in DFT based transport
calculations can lead to drastic errors in transport calculations while
exchange correlation contributions to the induced effective potential tend to
be less significant.
"
What is the nature of the phase coexistence in the polymer-polymer demixing transition?,"  Many water soluble polymers are chemically modified versions of insoluble
base materials such as cellulose. A Flory-Huggins model is solved to determine
the effects of heterogeneity in modification on the solubility of such
polymers. It is found that heterogeneity leads to decreased solubility, with
the effect increasing with increasing blockiness. In the limit of extreme
blockiness, the nature of the phase coexistence crosses over to a
polymer-polymer demixing transition. Some consequences are discussed for the
synthesis of partially modified polymers, and the experimental characterisation
of such systems.
"
"What are the conditions for a bijection between congruence classes of Gr-functors of the type $(\varphi,f)$ and the cohomology group $H^2(\Pi,\C)$?","  Each Gr-functor of the type $(\varphi,f)$ of a Gr-category of the type
$(\Pi,\C)$ has the obstruction be an element $\overline{k}\in H^3(\Pi,\C).$
When this obstruction vanishes, there exists a bijection between congruence
classes of Gr-functors of the type $(\varphi,f)$ and the cohomology group
$H^2(\Pi,\C).$ Then the relation of Gr-category theory and the group extension
problem can be established and used to prove that each Gr-category is
Gr-equivalent to a strict one.
"
What is the relationship between compositions of bipartite graphs and exponential generating functions?,"  The idea of graph compositions, which was introduced by A. Knopfmacher and M.
E. Mays, generalizes both ordinary compositions of positive integers and
partitions of finite sets. In their original paper they developed formulas,
generating functions, and recurrence relations for composition counting
functions for several families of graphs. Here we show that some of the results
involving compositions of bipartite graphs can be derived more easily using
exponential generating functions.
"
What is the effect of the coupling of electron and nuclear quantum dynamics on the electronic distribution?,"  Path integral Monte Carlo approach is used to study the coupled quantum
dynamics of the electron and nuclei in hydrogen molecule ion. The coupling
effects are demonstrated by comparing differences in adiabatic
Born--Oppenheimer and non-adiabatic simulations, and inspecting projections of
the full three-body dynamics onto adiabatic Born--Oppenheimer approximation.
  Coupling of electron and nuclear quantum dynamics is clearly seen. Nuclear
pair correlation function is found to broaden by 0.040 a_0 and average bond
length is larger by 0.056 a_0. Also, non-adiabatic correction to the binding
energy is found. Electronic distribution is affected less, and therefore, we
could say that the adiabatic approximation is better for the electron than for
the nuclei.
"
What are the implications of the gravitational interaction between massive bodies mediated by bulk gravitons in the 5-D spacetime?,"  We study the propagation of gravitons within 5-D supersymmetric braneworld
models with a bulk scalar field. The setup considered here consists of a 5-D
bulk spacetime bounded by two 4-D branes localized at the fixed points of an
$S^1/Z_2$ orbifold. There is a scalar field $\phi$ in the bulk which, provided
a superpotential $W(\phi)$, determines the warped geometry of the 5-D
spacetime. This type of scenario is common in string theory, where the bulk
scalar field $\phi$ is related to the volume of small compact extra dimensions.
We show that, after the moduli are stabilized by supersymmetry breaking terms
localized on the branes, the only relevant degrees of freedom in the bulk
consist of a 5-D massive spectrum of gravitons. Then we analyze the
gravitational interaction between massive bodies localized at the positive
tension brane mediated by these bulk gravitons. It is shown that the Newtonian
potential describing this interaction picks up a non-trivial contribution at
short distances that depends on the shape of the superpotential $W(\phi)$. We
compute this contribution for dilatonic braneworld scenarios $W(\phi) =
e^{\alpha \phi}$ (where $\alpha$ is a constant) and discuss the particular case
of 5-D Heterotic M-theory: It is argued that a specific footprint at micron
scales could be observable in the near future.
"
What is the impact of the electron lens on the proton bunch losses in the Tevatron proton-antiproton collider?,"  We report the first experimental demonstration of compensation of beam-beam
interaction effects in high-energy particle collider by using space-charge
forces of a low-energy electron beam. In our experiments, an electron lens, a
novel instrument developed for the beam-beam compensation, was set on a 980-GeV
proton bunch in the Tevatron proton-antiproton collider. The proton bunch
losses due to its interaction with antiproton beam were reduced by a factor of
2 when the electron lens was operating. We describe the principle of electron
lens operation and present experimental results.
"
What are the key factors that determine the difference between the change-point estimator of the resampled sequence and the one for the original sequence?,"  We study an AMOC time series model with an abrupt change in the mean and
dependent errors that fulfill certain mixing conditions. We obtain confidence
intervals for the unknown change-point via bootstrapping methods.
  Precisely we use a block bootstrap of the estimated centered error sequence.
Then we reconstruct a sequence with a change in the mean using the same
estimators as before. The difference between the change-point estimator of the
resampled sequence and the one for the original sequence can be use as an
approximation of the difference between the real change-point and its
estimator. This enables us to construct confidence intervals using the
empirical distribution of the resampled time series.
  A simulation study shows that the resampled confidence intervals are usually
closer to their target levels and at the same time smaller than the asymptotic
intervals.
"
What is the overdensity in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 5?,"  As part of preparations for a southern sky search for faint Milky Way dwarf
galaxy satellites, we report the discovery of a stellar overdensity in the
Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 5, lying at an angular distance of only
1.5 degrees from the recently discovered Bo{\""o}tes dwarf. The overdensity was
detected well above statistical noise by employing a sophisticated data mining
algorithm and does not correspond to any catalogued object. Overlaid isochrones
using stellar population synthesis models show that the color-magnitude diagram
of that region has the signature of an old (12 Gyr), metal-poor (${\rm
Fe/H}\approx-2.0$) stellar population at a tentative distance of 60 kpc,
evidently the same heliocentric distance as the Bo\""otes dwarf. We estimate the
new object to have a total magnitude of $M_{V}\sim-3.1\pm1.1$ mag and a
half-light radius of $r_{h}=4'.1\pm1'.6$ ($72\pm28$ pc) placing it in an
apparent $40<r_{h}<100$ pc void between globular clusters and dwarf galaxies,
occupied only by another recently discovered Milky Way Satellite, Coma
Berenices.
"
What are the anisotropic features of dipolar interaction near the shape resonance regime?,"  We derive a general effective many-body theory for bosonic polar molecules in
strong interaction regime, which cannot be correctly described by previous
theories within the first Born approximation. The effective Hamiltonian has
additional interaction terms, which surprisingly reduces the anisotropic
features of dipolar interaction near the shape resonance regime. In the 2D
system with dipole moment perpendicular to the plane, we find that the phonon
dispersion scales as $\sqrt{|\bfp|}$ in the low momentum ($\bfp$) limit,
showing the same low energy properties as a 2D charged Bose gas with Coulomb
($1/r$) interactions.
"
What are the applications of Bridgeland-Douglas stability conditions to triangulated categories?,"  This paper contains some applications of Bridgeland-Douglas stability
conditions on triangulated categories, and Joyce's work on counting invariants
of semistable objects, to the study of birational geometry. We introduce the
notion of motivic Gopakumar-Vafa invariants as counting invariants of
D2-branes, and show that they are invariant under birational transformations
between Calabi-Yau 3-folds. The result is similar to the fact that birational
Calabi-Yau 3-folds have the same betti numbers or Hodge numbers.
"
What is the condition for the spectra of two different self-adjoint extensions of a Jacobi operator to be real?,"  We present a technique for reconstructing a semi-infinite Jacobi operator in
the limit circle case from the spectra of two different self-adjoint
extensions. Moreover, we give necessary and sufficient conditions for two real
sequences to be the spectra of two different self-adjoint extensions of a
Jacobi operator in the limit circle case.
"
What is the purpose of the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) and the Mopra facility?,"  The Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) and the Mopra facility have been
used to search for new southern class I methanol masers at 9.9, 25 (J=5) and
104 GHz, which are thought to trace more energetic conditions in the interface
regions of molecular outflows, than the widespread class I masers at 44 and 95
GHz. One source shows a clear outflow association.
"
What is the Korteweg-de Vries equation of order three (gKdV-3)?,"  The I-method in its first version as developed by Colliander et al. is
applied to prove that the Cauchy-problem for the generalised Korteweg-de Vries
equation of order three (gKdV-3) is globally well-posed for large real-valued
data in the Sobolev space H^s, provided s>-1/42.
"
How do the leaders of precursor events predict the transition into a burst in rat neuron cultures?,"  Eytan and Marom recently showed that the spontaneous burst activity of rat
neuron cultures includes `first to fire' cells that consistently fire earlier
than others. Here we analyze the behavior of these neurons in long term
recordings of spontaneous activity of rat hippocampal and rat cortical neuron
cultures from three different laboratories. We identify precursor events that
may either subside (`small events') or can lead to a full-blown burst
(`pre-bursts'). We find that the activation in the pre-burst typically has a
first neuron (`leader'), followed by a localized response in its neighborhood.
Locality is diminished in the bursts themselves. The long term dynamics of the
leaders is relatively robust, evolving with a half-life of 23-34 hours.
Stimulation of the culture can temporarily alter the leader distribution, but
it returns to the previous distribution within about 1 hour. We show that the
leaders carry information about the identity of the burst, as measured by the
signature of the number of spikes per neuron in a burst. The number of spikes
from leaders in the first few spikes of a precursor event is furthermore shown
to be predictive with regard to the transition into a burst (pre-burst versus
small event). We conclude that the leaders play a r\^ole in the development of
the bursts, and conjecture that they are part of an underlying sub-network that
is excited first and then act as nucleation centers for the burst.
"
What is the result of the search for the flavor-changing charged current transition B+ -> \tau\nu?,"  With a sample of about 384 million BBbar pairs recorded with the BABAR
detector, we search for the flavor-changing charged current transition B+ ->
\tau\nu and perform an amplitude analysis of the effective flavor-changing
neutral current transition B+ -> \phi(1020)K*(892)+. We also extend our search
for other K* final states in the decay B0 -> phi(1020)K*0 with a large K*0 ->
K+pi- invariant mass. Two samples of events with one reconstructed hadronic B
decay or one reconstructed semileptonic B decay are selected, and in the recoil
a search for B+ -> \tau\nu is performed. We find a 2.6 sigma (3.2 sigma not
including expected background uncertainty) excess in data which can be
converted to a preliminary branching fraction central value of BR(B+ -> \tau\nu
) = (1.20 +0.40-0.38 +0.29-0.30 +-0.22) 10^-4. With the decay B+- ->
\phi(1020)K*(892)+-, twelve parameters are measured, where our measurements of
f_L=0.49+-0.05+-0.03, f_perp=0.21+-0.05+-0.02, and the strong phases point to
the presence of a substantial helicity-plus amplitude from a presently unknown
source.
"
What are the system generators and defining relations?,"  The Yangian of the strange Lie superalgebras in Drinfel'd realization is
defined. The current system generators and defining relations are described.
"
What is the implication of the Weyl group on the Weyl asymptotics?,"  We show that A-hypergeometric systems and Horn hypergeometric systems are
Weyl closed for very generic parameters.
"
"What is the aim of this review, and what are the main approaches discussed?","  The aim of this review is to provide better understanding of a few approaches
that have been proposed for treating nonequilibrium (time-dependent) processes
in statistical mechanics with the emphasis on the inter-relation between
theories. The ensemble method, as it was formulated by J. W. Gibbs, have the
great generality and the broad applicability to equilibrium statistical
mechanics. Different macroscopic environmental constraints lead to different
types of ensembles, with particular statistical characteristics. In the present
work, the statistical theory of nonequilibrium processes which is based on
nonequilibrium ensemble formalism is discussed. The kinetic approach to dynamic
many-body problems, which is important from the point of view of the
fundamental theory of irreversibility, is alluded to. The emphasis is on the
method of the nonequilibrium statistical operator (NSO) developed by D. N.
Zubarev. The NSO method permits one to generalize the Gibbs ensemble method to
the nonequilibrium case and to construct a nonequilibrium statistical operator
which enables one to obtain the transport equations and calculate the transport
coefficients in terms of correlation functions, and which, in the case of
equilibrium, goes over to the Gibbs distribution. Although some space is
devoted to the formal structure of the NSO method, the emphasis is on its
utility. Applications to specific problems such as the generalized transport
and kinetic equations, and a few examples of the relaxation and dissipative
processes, which manifest the operational ability of the method, are
considered.
"
What is the matrix element of the S-matrix used to calculate the cross-section?,"  Two methodological troubles of the quantum theory of collisions are
considered. The first is the undesirable interference of the incident and
scattered waves in the stationary approach to scattering. The second concerns
the nonstationary approach to the theory of collisions of the type $a+b\to
c+d$. In order to calculate the cross section one uses the matrix element
$<cd|S|ab>$ of the $S$-matrix. The element is proportional to $\delta$-function
expressing the energy conservation. The corresponding probability $|<
cd|S|ab>|^2$ contains $\delta^2$ which is mathematically senseless. The known
regular way to overcome the difficulty seems to be unsatisfactory. In this
paper, both the troubles are resolved using wave packets of incident particles.
"
What is the subject of nonlinearity-modified Bloch-oscillations in a ferromagnet?,"  We present our experimental investigations on the subject of
nonlinearity-modified Bloch-oscillations and of nonlinear Landau-Zener
tunneling between two energy bands in a rubidium Bose Einstein condensate in an
accelerated periodic potential. Nonlinearity introduces an asymmetry in
Landau-Zener tunneling. We also present measurements of resonantly enhanced
tunneling between the Wannier-Stark energy levels for Bose-Einstein condensates
loaded into an optical lattice.
"
What is the relationship between the anomalous diffusion in position space and the energization of particles?,"  The two--dimensional diffusive dynamics of test particles in a random
electromagnetic field is studied. The synthetic electromagnetic fluctuations
are generated through randomly placed magnetised ``clouds'' oscillating with a
frequency $\omega$. We investigate the mean square displacements of particles
in both position and velocity spaces. As $\omega$ increases the particles
undergo standard (Brownian--like) motion, anomalous diffusion and ballistic
motion in position space. Although in general the diffusion properties in
velocity space are not trivially related to those in position space, we find
that energization is present only when particles display anomalous diffusion in
position space. The anomalous character of the diffusion is only in the
non--standard values of the scaling exponents while the process is Gaussian.
"
What is the time window for the administration of cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor to be effective?,"  Several studies suggest that cyclooxygenase-2 contributes to the delayed
progression of ischemic brain damage. In this study we examined whether the
highly selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor DFU reduces neuronal damage when
administered several hours after 5 min of transient forebrain ischemia in
gerbils. The extent of ischemic injury was assessed behaviorally by measuring
the increases in locomotor activity and by histopathological evaluation of the
extent of CA1 hippocampal pyramidal cell injury 7 days after ischemia. DFU
treatment (10 mg/kg, p.o.) significantly reduced hippocampal neuronal damage
even if the treatment is delayed until 12 h after ischemia. These results
suggest that selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors may be a valuable
therapeutic strategy for ischemic brain injury.
"
What is the effect of accretion from a warped disc on the evolution of black hole spins?,"  We investigate the conjecture by Sikora, Stawarz & Lasota (2007) that the
observed AGN--radio-loudness bimodality can be explained by the
morphology-related bimodality of black-hole spin distribution in the centers of
galaxies: central black holes in giant elliptical galaxies may have (on
average) much larger spins than black holes in spiral/disc galaxies. We study
how accretion from a warped disc influences the evolution of black hole spins
and conclude that within the cosmological framework, where the most massive BHs
have grown in mass via merger driven accretion, one indeed expects most
supermassive black holes in elliptical galaxies to have on average higher spin
than black holes in spiral galaxies, where random, small accretion episodes
(e.g. tidally disrupted stars, accretion of molecular clouds) might have played
a more important role.
"
"What are the advantages of using nonlocal models of gravity, inspired by quantum loop corrections, to explain current cosmic acceleration?","  We explore nonlocally modified models of gravity, inspired by quantum loop
corrections, as a mechanism for explaining current cosmic acceleration. These
theories enjoy two major advantages: they allow a delayed response to cosmic
events, here the transition from radiation to matter dominance, and they avoid
the usual level of fine tuning; instead, emulating Dirac's dictum, the required
large numbers come from the large time scales involved. Their solar system
effects are safely negligible, and they may even prove useful to the black hole
information problem.
"
What are the implications of the low-energy Zhang-Rice bands for the orbital character in Ni-d and O-p orbitals?,"  The bandstructure of the prototypical charge-transfer insulator NiO is
computed by using a combination of an {\it ab initio} bandstructure method and
the dynamical mean-field theory with a quantum Monte-Carlo impurity solver.
Employing a Hamiltonian which includes both Ni-d and O-p orbitals we find
excellent agreement with the energy bands determined from angle-resolved
photoemission spectroscopy. This solves a long-standing problem in solid state
theory. Most notably we obtain the low-energy Zhang-Rice bands with strongly
k-dependent orbital character discussed previously in the context of low-energy
model theories.
"
What is the metric representing interiors of black holes in five-dimensional AdS?,"  The warped solution of Einstein's equations corresponding to the spherical
brane in five-dimensional AdS is considered. This metric represents interiors
of black holes on both sides of the brane and can provide gravitational
trapping of physical fields on the shell. It is found the analytic form of the
coordinate transformations from the Schwartschild to co-moving frame that
exists only in five dimensions. It is shown that in the static coordinates
active gravitational mass of the spherical brane, in agreement with Tolman's
formula, is negative, i.e. such objects are gravitationally repulsive.
"
What is the current-voltage characteristic of a nanocluster modelled by a metallic spherical particle?,"  Theoretical description of the field emission of electrons from nanoscale
objects weakly coupled to the cathode is presented. It is shown that the field-
emission current increases in a step-like fashion due to single-electron
charging which leads to abrupt changes of the effective electric field
responsible for the field emission. A detailed consideration of the
current-voltage characteristics is carried out for a nanocluster modelled by a
metallic spherical particle in the close vicinity of the cathode and for a
cylindrical silicon nanowire grown on the cathode surface.
"
What are the implications of a complex system dissociation in a viscous medium with momentum conservation?,"  In an ensemble of non-interacting Brownian particles, a finite systematic
average velocity may temporarily develop, even if it is zero initially. The
effect originates from a small nonlinear correction to the dissipative force,
causing the equation for the first moment of velocity to couple to moments of
higher order. The effect may be relevant when a complex system dissociates in a
viscous medium with conservation of momentum.
"
How do kernel methods compare vector or fingerprint representations of molecules?,"  Support vector machines and kernel methods have recently gained considerable
attention in chemoinformatics. They offer generally good performance for
problems of supervised classification or regression, and provide a flexible and
computationally efficient framework to include relevant information and prior
knowledge about the data and problems to be handled. In particular, with kernel
methods molecules do not need to be represented and stored explicitly as
vectors or fingerprints, but only to be compared to each other through a
comparison function technically called a kernel. While classical kernels can be
used to compare vector or fingerprint representations of molecules, completely
new kernels were developed in the recent years to directly compare the 2D or 3D
structures of molecules, without the need for an explicit vectorization step
through the extraction of molecular descriptors. While still in their infancy,
these approaches have already demonstrated their relevance on several toxicity
prediction and structure-activity relationship problems.
"
What is the effect of the displacement parameter in the shock wave case?,"  Building on work of Barker, Humpherys, Lafitte, Rudd, and Zumbrun in the
shock wave case, we study stability of compressive, or ""shock-like"", boundary
layers of the isentropic compressible Navier-Stokes equations with gamma-law
pressure by a combination of asymptotic ODE estimates and numerical Evans
function computations. Our results indicate stability for gamma in the interval
[1, 3] for all compressive boundary-layers, independent of amplitude, save for
inflow layers in the characteristic limit (not treated). Expansive inflow
boundary-layers have been shown to be stable for all amplitudes by Matsumura
and Nishihara using energy estimates. Besides the parameter of amplitude
appearing in the shock case, the boundary-layer case features an additional
parameter measuring displacement of the background profile, which greatly
complicates the resulting case structure. Moreover, inflow boundary layers turn
out to have quite delicate stability in both large-displacement and
large-amplitude limits, necessitating the additional use of a mod-two stability
index studied earlier by Serre and Zumbrun in order to decide stability.
"
What are the implications of the decoy state QKD system for the decoy state QKD?,"  Decoy State Quantum Key Distribution (QKD), being capable of beating PNS
attack and uncon- ditionally secure, have become an attractive one recently.
But, in many QKD systems, disturbances of transmission channel make quantum bit
error rate (QBER) increase which limits both security distance and key bit rate
of real-life decoy state QKD systems. We demonstrate the two-intensity decoy
QKD with one-way Faraday-Michelson phase modulation system, which is free of
channel dis- turbance and keeps interference fringe visibility (99%) long
period, near 130KM single mode optical fiber in telecom (1550 nm) wavelength.
This is longest distance fiber decoy state QKD system based on two intensity
protocol.
"
What are the axioms of the distributions?,"  The new axiomatic system for the quantum field theory is proposed. The new
axioms are the description of the distributions. For the finite series these
distributions satisfy the linear Wightman axioms.
"
What is the theoretical framework for the ground states of the doped Mott insulator on the Shastry-Sutherland lattice?,"  Motivated by recent experiments on SrCu$_2$(BO$_3$)$_2$, we investigate the
ground states of the doped Mott insulator on the Shastry-Sutherland lattice. To
provide a unified theoretical framework for both the valence-bond solid state
found in undoped SrCu$_2$(BO$_3$)$_2$ and the doped counterpart being pursued
in on-going experiments, we analyze the t-J-$V$ model via the bond operator
formulation. It is found that novel superconducting states emerge upon doping
with their properties crucially depending on the underlying valence bond order.
Implications to future experiments are discussed.
"
What is the implication of the PSD analysis for the classification of NGC 3783 as an active galactic nucleus (AGN) or a galactic black hole X-ray binary (GBH)?,"  Previous observations with the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) have
suggested that the power spectral density (PSD) of NGC 3783 flattens to a slope
near zero at low frequencies, in a similar manner to that of Galactic black
hole X-ray binary systems (GBHs) in the `hard' state. The low radio flux
emitted by this object, however, is inconsistent with a hard state
interpretation. The accretion rate of NGC 3783 (~7% of the Eddington rate) is
similar to that of other AGN with `soft' state PSDs and higher than that at
which the GBH Cyg X-1, with which AGN are often compared, changes between
`hard' and `soft' states (~2% of the Eddington rate). If NGC 3783 really does
have a `hard' state PSD, it would be quite unusual and would indicate that AGN
and GBHs are not quite as similar as we currently believe. Here we present an
improved X-ray PSD of NGC 3783, spanning from ~10^{-8} to ~10^{-3} Hz, based on
considerably extended (5.5 years) RXTE observations combined with two orbits of
continuous observation by XMM-Newton. We show that this PSD is, in fact, well
fitted by a `soft' state model which has only one break, at high frequencies.
Although a `hard' state model can also fit the data, the improvement in fit by
adding a second break at low frequency is not significant. Thus NGC 3783 is not
unusual. These results leave Arakelian 564 as the only AGN which shows a second
break at low frequencies, although in that case the very high accretion rate
implies a `very high', rather than `hard' state PSD. The break frequency found
in NGC 3783 is consistent with the expectation based on comparisons with other
AGN and GBHs, given its black hole mass and accretion rate.
"
What is the formula for the neutrino oscillation probability in matter with constant density?,"  The exact formula for the neutrino oscillation probability in matter with
constant density, which was discovered by Kimura, Takamura and Yokomakura, has
been applied mostly to the standard case with three flavor neutrino so far. In
this paper applications of their formula to more general cases are discussed.
It is shown that this formalism can be generalized to various cases where the
matter potential have off-diagonal components, and the two non-trivial examples
are given: the case with magnetic moments and a magnetic field and the case
with non-standard interactions. It is pointed out that their formalism can be
applied also to the case in the long baseline limit with matter whose density
varies adiabatically as in the case of solar neutrino.
"
What is the excess brightness of zodiacal light observed by the Helios B space probe?,"  To contribute to the knowledge of dynamics of interplanetary dust we are
searching for structures in the spatial distribution of interplanetary dust
near the orbit of Venus. To this end we study the radial gradient of zodiacal
light brightness, as observed by the zodiacal light photometer on board the
Helios space probes on several orbits from 1975 to 1979. The cleanest data
result from Helios B (= Helios 2) launched in January 1976. With respect to the
general increase of zodiacal light brightness towards the Sun, the data show an
excess brightness of a few percent for positions of the Helios space probe just
outside the orbit of Venus. We consider this as evidence for a dust ring
associated with the orbit of Venus, somewhat similar to that found earlier
along the Earth's orbit.
"
What is the relationship between the volume of the cluster and the van der Waals coefficient C6?,"  In this paper we employ all-electron \textit{ab-initio} time-dependent
density functional theory based method to calculate the long range
dipole-dipole dispersion coefficient (van der Waals coefficient) $C_{6}$ of
sodium atom clusters containing even number of atoms ranging from 2 to 20
atoms. The dispersion coefficients are obtained via Casimir-Polder relation.
The calculations are carried out with two different exchange-correlation
potentials: (i) the asymptotically correct statistical average of orbital
potential (SAOP) and (ii) Vosko-Wilk-Nusair representation of
exchange-correlation potential within local density approximation. A comparison
with the other theoretical results has been performed. We also present the
results for the static polarizabilities of sodium clusters and also compare
them with other theoretical and experimental results. These comparisons reveal
that the SAOP results for C_{6} and static polarizability are quite accurate
and very close to the experimental results. We examine the relationship between
volume of the cluster and van der Waals coefficient and find that to a very
high degree of correlation C_{6} scales as square of the volume. We also
present the results for van der Waals coefficient corresponding to cluster-Ar
atom and cluster-N_{2} molecule interactions.
"
What is the algebraic structure of the operator that associates the basis of descent sets to that of peak sets for the algebra of peak functions?,"  Via duality of Hopf algebras, there is a direct association between peak
quasisymmetric functions and enumeration of chains in Eulerian posets. We study
this association explicitly, showing that the notion of $\cd$-index, long
studied in the context of convex polytopes and Eulerian posets, arises as the
dual basis to a natural basis of peak quasisymmetric functions introduced by
Stembridge. Thus Eulerian posets having a nonnegative $\cd$-index (for example,
face lattices of convex polytopes) correspond to peak quasisymmetric functions
having a nonnegative representation in terms of this basis. We diagonalize the
operator that associates the basis of descent sets for all quasisymmetric
functions to that of peak sets for the algebra of peak functions, and study the
$g$-polynomial for Eulerian posets as an algebra homomorphism.
"
What is the application of the covariant star product in quantum mechanics?,"  The star product formalism has proved to be an alternative formulation for
nonrelativistic quantum mechanics. We want introduce here a covariant star
product in order to extend the star product formalism to relativistic quantum
mechanics in the proper time formulation.
"
What are the implications of the use of Hardy functions for the Gamow states?,"  In this reply, we show that the author of the Comment arXiv:0704.3529v1
inadvertently provides additional arguments against the use of Hardy functions
as test functions for the Gamow states.
"
What is the Bloch group and its extended version?,"  Our paper originated from a generalization of the Volume Conjecture to
multisums of $q$-hypergeometric terms. This generalization was sketched by
Kontsevich in a problem list in Aarhus University in 2006; \cite{Ko}. We
introduce the notion of a $q$-hypergeometric term (in short, $q$-term). The
latter is a product of ratios of $q$-factorials in linear forms in several
variables. In the first part of the paper, we show how to construct elements of
the Bloch group (and its extended version) given a \qterm. Their image under
the Bloch-Wigner map or the Rogers dilogarithm is a finite set of periods of
weight 2, in the sense of Kontsevich-Zagier. In the second part of the paper we
introduce the notion of a special $q$-term, its corresponding sequence of
polynomials, and its generating series. Examples of special $q$-terms come
naturally from Quantum Topology, and in particular from planar projections of
knots. The two parts are tied together by a conjecture that relates the
singularities of the generating series of a special $q$-term with the periods
of the corresponding elements of the extended Bloch group. In some cases (such
as the $4_1$ knot), the conjecture is known.
"
What is the Viterbi algorithm used to decode hidden Markov models?,"  In this paper, we introduce the on-line Viterbi algorithm for decoding hidden
Markov models (HMMs) in much smaller than linear space. Our analysis on
two-state HMMs suggests that the expected maximum memory used to decode
sequence of length $n$ with $m$-state HMM can be as low as $\Theta(m\log n)$,
without a significant slow-down compared to the classical Viterbi algorithm.
Classical Viterbi algorithm requires $O(mn)$ space, which is impractical for
analysis of long DNA sequences (such as complete human genome chromosomes) and
for continuous data streams. We also experimentally demonstrate the performance
of the on-line Viterbi algorithm on a simple HMM for gene finding on both
simulated and real DNA sequences.
"
What are the implications of the valence ordering of 2+ and 3+ iron valences on the B-sites in magnetite?,"  Magnetite (Fe$_{3}$O$_{4}$) is a mixed valent system where electronic
conductivity occurs on the B-site (octahedral) iron sublattice of the spinel
structure. Below $T_{V}=122$ K, a metal-insulator transition occurs which is
argued to arise from the charge ordering of 2+ and 3+ iron valences on the
B-sites (Verwey transition). Inelastic neutron scattering measurements show
that optical spin waves propagating on the B-site sublattice ($\sim$80 meV) are
shifted upwards in energy above $T_{V}$ due to the occurrence of B-B
ferromagnetic double exchange in the mixed valent metallic phase. The double
exchange interaction affects only spin waves of $\Delta_{5}$ symmetry, not all
modes, indicating that valence fluctuations are slow and the double exchange is
constrained by electron correlations above $T_{V}$.
"
What is the difference between the spin wave modes observed at RHIC and the LHC?,"  We predict how differential elliptic flow v2(pT) changes from RHIC to LHC
collision energies (Pb+Pb at 5.5 TeV/nucleon), ASSUMING that the quark-gluon
system created has a ``minimal'' shear viscosity eta/s = 1/(4*pi) at both RHIC
and the LHC.
"
How can disorder affect the superfluid properties of an ultracold gas in an optical lattice?,"  In the present paper we describe the properties induced by disorder on an
ultracold gas of Bosonic atoms loaded into a two-dimensional optical lattice
with global confinement ensured by a parabolic potential. Our analysis is
centered on the spatial distribution of the various phases, focusing
particularly on the superfluid properties of the system as a function of
external parameters and disorder amplitude. In particular, it is shown how
disorder can suppress superfluidity, while partially preserving the system
coherence.
"
What are the properties that the decidable logic can express?,"  We define a new decidable logic for expressing and checking invariants of
programs that manipulate dynamically-allocated objects via pointers and
destructive pointer updates. The main feature of this logic is the ability to
limit the neighborhood of a node that is reachable via a regular expression
from a designated node. The logic is closed under boolean operations
(entailment, negation) and has a finite model property. The key technical
result is the proof of decidability. We show how to express precondition,
postconditions, and loop invariants for some interesting programs. It is also
possible to express properties such as disjointness of data-structures, and
low-level heap mutations. Moreover, our logic can express properties of
arbitrary data-structures and of an arbitrary number of pointer fields. The
latter provides a way to naturally specify postconditions that relate the
fields on entry to a procedure to the fields on exit. Therefore, it is possible
to use the logic to automatically prove partial correctness of programs
performing low-level heap mutations.
"
What are the entanglement assisted classical capacity channels?,"  In this paper we evaluate the entanglement assisted classical capacity of a
class of quantum channels with long-term memory, which are convex combinations
of memoryless channels. The memory of such channels can be considered to be
given by a Markov chain which is aperiodic but not irreducible.
"
What are the implications of the results of this observation for our understanding of the formation of the Coalsack Nebula?,"  We have used FUSE and Voyager observations of dust scattered starlight in the
neighborhood of the Coalsack Nebula to derive the optical constants of the dust
grains. The albedo is consistent with a value of $0.28 \pm 0.04$ and the phase
function asymmetry factor with a value of $0.61 \pm 0.07$ throughout the
spectral range from 900 -- 1200 \AA, in agreement with previous determinations
as well as theoretical predictions. We have now observed two regions (Ophiuchus
and Coalsack) with intense diffuse background radiation and in both cases have
found that the emission is due to light from nearby hot stars scattered by a
relatively thin foreground cloud, with negligible contribution from the
background molecular cloud.
"
What is the procedure of constructing local symmetry generators of general quadratic Lagrangian theory?,"  We propose a procedure which allows one to construct local symmetry
generators of general quadratic Lagrangian theory. Manifest recurrence
relations for generators in terms of so-called structure matrices of the Dirac
formalism are obtained. The procedure fulfilled in terms of initial variables
of the theory, and do not implies either separation of constraints on first and
second class subsets or any other choice of basis for constraints.
"
What is the Chern-Simons model with non-abelian 't Hooft magnetic fluxes?,"  We evaluate the ground state degeneracy of noncommutative Chern-Simons models
on the two-torus, a quantity that is interpreted as the ""topological order"" of
associated phases of Hall fluids. We define the noncommutative theory via
T-duality from an ordinary Chern-Simons model with non-abelian 't Hooft
magnetic fluxes. Motivated by this T-duality, we propose a discrete family of
noncommutative, non-abelian fluid models, arising as a natural generalization
of the standard noncommutative Chern-Simons effective models. We compute the
topological order for these universality classes, and comment on their possible
microscopic interpretation.
"
What is the Jacobian of a genus two curve defined over a finite field with complex multiplication?,"  Consider the Jacobian of a genus two curve defined over a finite field and
with complex multiplication. In this paper we show that if the l-Sylow subgroup
of the Jacobian is not cyclic, then the embedding degree of the Jacobian with
respect to l is one.
"
What are the implications of the result of the logarithmic comparison theorem for a non-quasihomogeneous singularity?,"  For quasihomogeneous isolated hypersurface singularities, the logarithmic
comparison theorem has been characterized explicitly by Holland and Mond. In
the non quasihomogeneous case, we give a necessary condition for the
logarithmic comparison theorem in terms of the Gauss-Manin system of the
singularity. It shows in particular that the logarithmic comparison theorem can
hold for a non quasihomogeneous singularity only if 1 is an eigenvalue of the
monodromy.
"
What is the van der Waerden function?,"  For positive integers $s$ and $k_1, k_2, ..., k_s$, let $w(k_1,k_2,...,k_s)$
be the minimum integer $n$ such that any $s$-coloring $\{1,2,...,n\} \to
\{1,2,...,s\}$ admits a $k_i$-term arithmetic progression of color $i$ for some
$i$, $1 \leq i \leq s$. In the case when $k_1=k_2=...=k_s=k$ we simply write
$w(k;s)$.
  That such a minimum integer exists follows from van der Waerden's theorem on
arithmetic progressions.
  In the present paper we give a lower bound for $w(k,m)$ for each fixed $m$.
We include a table with values of $w(k,3)$ which match this lower bound closely
for $5 \leq k \leq 16$. We also give an upper bound for $w(k,4)$, an upper
bound for $w(4;s)$, and a lower bound for $w(k;s)$ for an arbitrary fixed $k$.
We discuss a number of other functions that are closely related to the van der
Waerden function.
"
What is the need for a theoretical understanding of charge migration in DNA-based materials?,"  Long range charge transfer experiments in DNA oligomers and the subsequently
measured -- and very diverse -- transport response of DNA wires in solid state
experiments exemplifies the need for a thorough theoretical understanding of
charge migration in DNA-based natural and artificial materials. Here we present
a review of tight-binding models for DNA conduction which have the intrinsic
merit of containing more structural information than plain rate-equation models
while still retaining sufficient detail of the electronic properties. This
allows for simulations of transport properties to be more manageable with
respect to density functional theory methods or correlated first principle
algorithms.
"
What are the key concepts of the modified system?,"  We will introduce a modified system of A-hypergeometric system (GKZ system)
by applying a change of variables for Groebner deformations and study its
Groebner basis and the indicial polynomials along the ""exceptional
hypersurface"".
"
Can nonlinear boundary conditions be treated in quasilinear elliptic problems?,"  Existence and non-existence results are established for quasilinear elliptic
problems with nonlinear boundary conditions and lack of compactness. The proofs
combine variational methods with the geometrical feature, due to the
competition between the different growths of the non-linearities.
"
What are the main mathematical problems in algebraic statistics?,"  Algebraic statistics is concerned with the study of probabilistic models and
techniques for statistical inference using methods from algebra and geometry.
This article presents a list of open mathematical problems in this emerging
field, with main emphasis on graphical models with hidden variables, maximum
likelihood estimation, and multivariate Gaussian distributions. This article is
based on a lecture presented at the IMA in Minneapolis during the 2006/07
program on Applications of Algebraic Geometry.
"
What is the structure of the groups of rational points on elliptic curves?,"  We study the possible structure of the groups of rational points on elliptic
curves of the form y^2=(ax+1)(bx+1)(cx+1), where a,b,c are non-zero rationals
such that the product of any two of them is one less than a square.
"
What are the temporal distinguishability effects of the Hong-Ou-Mandel interferometer?,"  By using an asymmetric beam splitter, we observe the generalized
Hong-Ou-Mandel effects for three and four photons, respectively. Furthermore,
we can use this generalized Hong-Ou-Mandel interferometer to characterize
temporal distinguishability.
"
What are the data assimilation techniques used to predict solar flares?,"  Data assimilation techniques, developed in the last two decades mainly for
weather prediction, produce better forecasts by taking advantage of both
theoretical/numerical models and real-time observations. In this paper, we
explore the possibility of applying the data-assimilation techniques known as
4D-VAR to the prediction of solar flares. We do so in the context of a
continuous version of the classical cellular-automaton-based self-organized
critical avalanche models of solar flares introduced by Lu and Hamilton
(Astrophys. J., 380, L89, 1991). Such models, although a priori far removed
from the physics of magnetic reconnection and magneto-hydrodynamical evolution
of coronal structures, nonetheless reproduce quite well the observed
statistical distribution of flare characteristics. We report here on a large
set of data assimilation runs on synthetic energy release time series. Our
results indicate that, despite the unpredictable (and unobservable) stochastic
nature of the driving/triggering mechanism within the avalanche model, 4D-VAR
succeeds in producing optimal initial conditions that reproduce adequately the
time series of energy released by avalanches/flares. This is an essential first
step towards forecasting real flares.
"
What is the consequence of the inequivalent quantization of the classical system?,"  We show that the classical scale symmetry of a particle moving in cosmic
string background is broken upon inequivalent quantization of the classical
system, leading to anomaly. The consequence of this anomaly is the formation of
single bound state in the coupling interval \gamma\in(-1,1). The inequivalent
quantization is characterized by a 1-parameter family of self-adjoint extension
parameter \omega. It has been conjectured that the formation of loosely bound
state in cosmic string background may lead to the so called anomalous
scattering cross section for the particles, which is usually seen in molecular
physics.
"
"What is the effect of the Pauli exclusion principle on double ionization of He atoms by strong, linearly polarized laser pulses?","  The effect of the Pauli exclusion principle on double ionization of He atoms
by strong, linearly polarized laser pulses is analyzed. We show that correlated
electron escape, with electron momenta symmetric with respect to the field
polarization axis, is suppressed if atoms are initially prepared in the
metastable state 3S. The effect is a consequence of selection rules for the
transition to the appropriate outgoing two-electron states. We illustrate the
suppression in numerical calculations of electron and ion momentum
distributions within a reduced dimensionality model.
"
What is the behavior of the volume growth of ionized regions around clustered UV photon sources?,"  We investigate the volume growth of ionized regions around UV photon sources
with the WENO algorithm, which is an effective solver of photon kinetics in the
phase space described by the radiative transfer equation. We show that the
volume growth rate, either of isolated ionized regions or of clustered regions
in merging, generally consists of three phases: fast or relativistic growth
phase at the early stage, slow growth phase at the later stage, and a
transition phase between the fast and slow phases. We also show that the volume
growth of ionized regions around clustered sources with intensity $\dot{E}_i$
($i=1, 2, ...$) would have the same behavior as a single source with intensity
$\dot{E}=\sum_i\dot{E}_i$, if all the distances between nearest neighbor
sources $i$ and $j$ are smaller than $c(t^i_c+t^j_c)$, $t^i_c$ being the time
scale $t_c$ of source $i$. Therefore, a tightly clustered UV photon sources
would lead to a slow growth of ionized volume. This effect would be important
for studying the redshift-dependence of 21cm signals from the reionization
epoch.
"
What is the construction of total foliations of a compact and orientable three-manifold?,"  On every compact and orientable three-manifold, we construct total foliations
(three codimension 1 foliations that are transverse at every point). This
construction can be performed on any homotopy class of plane fields with
vanishing Euler class.
  As a corollary we obtain similar results on bi-contact structures.
"
What are the six qualitatively different asymptotic score distributions of a three-agent game?,"  We study the dynamics and resulting score distribution of three-agent games
where after each competition a single agent wins and scores a point. A single
competition is described by a triplet of numbers $p$, $t$ and $q$ denoting the
probabilities that the team with the highest, middle or lowest accumulated
score wins. We study the full family of solutions in the regime, where the
number of agents and competitions is large, which can be regarded as a
hydrodynamic limit. Depending on the parameter values $(p,q,t)$, we find six
qualitatively different asymptotic score distributions and we also provide a
qualitative understanding of these results. We checked our analytical results
against numerical simulations of the microscopic model and find these to be in
excellent agreement. The three agent game can be regarded as a social model
where a player can be favored or disfavored for advancement, based on his/her
accumulated score. It is also possible to decide the outcome of a three agent
game through a mini tournament of two-a gent competitions among the
participating players and it turns out that the resulting possible score
distributions are a subset of those obtained for the general three agent-games.
We discuss how one can add a steady and democratic decline rate to the model
and present a simple geometric construction that allows one to write down the
corresponding score evolution equations for $n$-agent games.
"
What is the Hawking-Page phase transition between a spherical AdS black hole and a thermal AdS space?,"  It is well-known that there exists a Hawking-Page phase transition between a
spherical AdS black hole and a thermal AdS space. The phase transition does not
happen between a Ricci flat AdS black hole whose horizon is a Ricci flat space
and a thermal AdS space in the Poincare coordinates. However, the Hawking-Page
phase transition occurs between a Ricci flat AdS black hole and an AdS soliton
if at least one of horizon coordinates for the Ricci flat black hole is
compact. We show a similar phase transition betwen the Ricci flat black holes
and deformed AdS solitons in the Gauss-Bonnet gravity and the dilaton gravity
with a Liouville-type potential including the gauged supergravity coming from
the spherical reduction of Dp-branes in type II supergravity. In contrast to
Einstein gravity, we find that the high temperature phase can be dominated
either by black holes or deformed AdS solitons depending on parameters.
"
What is the relationship between precipitable water vapor (PWV) and opacity at 225 GHz?,"  We report precipitable water vapor (PWV) measurements made at Las Campanas
Observatory using optical spectra of H2O lines obtained with the Magellan
echelle spectrograph, and calculated using a robust technique that is accurate
to 5-10%. Calibration of the relationship between our PWV measurements and
opacity values at 225 GHz was made possible by simultaneous tipping radiometer
observations. Based on this calibration, we present Las Campanas Observatory
winter-time precipitable water vapor statistics, measured using the tipping
radiometer, during a two month campaign. The median value of 2.8 +- 0.3 mm is
consistent with that measured at the nearby La Silla Observatory during the VLT
site survey. We conclude that, in the Southern hemisphere winter months, we can
expect good conditions for infrared observing (<~1.5 mm) approximately 10% of
the time at Las Campanas Observatory.
"
What are the Majorana fermion field in a supersymmetric theory?,"  We construct a quantum theory of free fermion field based on the generalized
uncertainty principle using supersymmetry as a guiding principle. A
supersymmetric field theory with a real scalar field and a Majorana fermion
field is given explicitly and we also find that the supersymmetry algebra is
deformed from an usual one.
"
What is the structure of the radio counterpart of XTE J1701-462?,"  We report radio observations, made with the Australia Telescope Compact
Array, of the X-ray transient XTE J1701-462. This system has been classified as
a new `Z' source, displaying characteristic patterns of behaviour probably
associated with accretion onto a low magnetic field neutron star at close to
the Eddington limit. The radio counterpart is highly variable, and was detected
in six of sixteen observations over the period 2006 January -- April. The
coupling of radio emission to X-ray state, despite limited sampling, appears to
be similar to that of other `Z' sources, in that there is no radio emission on
the flaring branch. The mean radio and X-ray luminosities are consistent with
the other Z sources for a distance of 5--15 kpc. The radio spectrum is
unusually flat, or even inverted, in contrast to the related sources, Sco X-1
and Cir X-1, which usually display an optically thin radio spectrum. Deep
wide-field observations indicate an extended structure three arcminutes to the
south which is aligned with the X-ray binary. This seems to represent a
significant overdensity of radio sources for the field and so, although a
background source remains a strong possibility, we consider it plausible that
this is a large-scale jet associated with XTE J1701-462.
"
What are the implications of conformal anomaly at high energy for the cancellation of quark-gluon-quark interactions?,"  This review describes the conformality approach to extending the standard
model of particle phenomenology using an assumption of no conformal anomaly at
high energy. Topics include quiver gauge theory, the conformality approach to
phenomenology, strong-electroweak unification at 4 TeV, cancellation of
quadratic divergences, cancellation of U(1) anomalies, and a dark matter
candidate.
"
What are the properties of Chow rings of toric stacks?,"  The purpose of this paper is to prove that integral Chow rings of toric
stacks are naturally isomorphic to Stanley-Reisner rings.
"
What are the cohomology of crystals and locally constant \'etale sheaves on the generic fiber?,"  Let $X$ be an integral model at a prime $p$ of a Shimura variety of PEL type
having good reduction, associated to a reductive group $G$. To $\mathbb{Z}_p$
reprsententations of the group $G$ can be associated two kinds of sheaves :
crystals on the special fiber of $X$, and locally constant \'etale sheaves on
the generic fiber. We establish a comparison between the cohomology of these
two kinds of sheaves.
"
What are the two new adaptive multiple testing procedures proposed to control the False Discovery Rate (FDR) in hypothesis testing?,"  In the context of multiple hypotheses testing, the proportion $\pi_0$ of true
null hypotheses in the pool of hypotheses to test often plays a crucial role,
although it is generally unknown a priori. A testing procedure using an
implicit or explicit estimate of this quantity in order to improve its
efficency is called adaptive. In this paper, we focus on the issue of False
Discovery Rate (FDR) control and we present new adaptive multiple testing
procedures with control of the FDR. First, in the context of assuming
independent $p$-values, we present two new procedures and give a unified review
of other existing adaptive procedures that have provably controlled FDR. We
report extensive simulation results comparing these procedures and testing
their robustness when the independence assumption is violated. The new proposed
procedures appear competitive with existing ones. The overall best, though, is
reported to be Storey's estimator, but for a parameter setting that does not
appear to have been considered before. Second, we propose adaptive versions of
step-up procedures that have provably controlled FDR under positive dependences
and unspecified dependences of the $p$-values, respectively. While simulations
only show an improvement over non-adaptive procedures in limited situations,
these are to our knowledge among the first theoretically founded adaptive
multiple testing procedures that control the FDR when the $p$-values are not
independent.
"
What are the gaps in the published paper that were spotted by Paul Vojta?,"  I gave a geometric proof of Vojta's 1 + epsilon conjecture.
  Some gaps in the published paper were spotted and kindly pointed out to me by
Paul Vojta. These were addressed in ""Erratum"".
"
What are the initial value problems for Schrödinger equations with Dirac-like initial data?,"  In this article we will study the initial value problem for some
Schr\""odinger equations with Diraclike initial data and therefore with infinite
L2 mass, obtaining positive results for subcritical nonlinearities. In the
critical case and in one dimension we prove that after some renormalization the
corresponding solution has finite energy. This allows us to conclude a
stability result in the defocusing setting. These problems are related to the
existence of a singular dynamics for Schr\""odinger maps through the so called
Hasimoto transformation.
"
What is the relationship between bosons and fermions in an optical lattice undergoing a superfluid-insulator transition?,"  It is well known that bosons on an optical lattice undergo a second-order
superfluid-insulator transition (SIT) when the lattice potential increases. In
this paper we study SIT when fermions coexist with the bosons. We find that the
critical properties of particle-hole symmetric SIT with dynamical exponent z=1
is modified when fermions are present; it either becomes a fluctuation-driven
first order transition or a different second-order transition. On the other
hand the more generic particle-hole asymmetric (with z=2) SIT is stable against
coupling with fermions. We also discuss pairing interaction between fermions
mediated by quantum critical fluctuations near SIT.
"
What is the relationship between the symmetry breaking and the energy eigenvalues for the Dirac oscillator?,"  In the present work we obtain a new representation for the Dirac oscillator
based on the Clifford algebra $C\ell_7.$ The symmetry breaking and the energy
eigenvalues for our model of the Dirac oscillator are studied in the
non-relativistic limit.
"
What is the three-body problem for three atomic fermions in the same spin state?,"  We study the three-body problem for three atomic fermions, in the same spin
state, experiencing a resonant interaction in the p-wave channel via a Feshbach
resonance represented by a two-channel model. The rate of inelastic processes
due to recombination to deeply bound dimers is then estimated from the
three-body solution using a simple prescription. We obtain numerical and
analytical predictions for most of the experimentally relevant quantities that
can be extracted from the three-body solution: the existence of weakly bound
trimers and their lifetime, the low-energy elastic and inelastic scattering
properties of an atom on a weakly bound dimer (including the atom-dimer
scattering length and scattering volume), and the recombination rates for three
colliding atoms towards weakly bound and deeply bound dimers. The effect of
""background"" non-resonant interactions in the open channel of the two-channel
model is also calculated and allows to determine which three-body quantities
are `universal' and which on the contrary depend on the details of the model.
"
What are the longitudinal and transverse motions of a carbon nanotube?,"  Heat conduction of a real quasi-one dimensional material, the finite length
carbon nanowire (CNW), inserted into the single-walled carbon nanotube (SWNT)
has been studied by the molecular dynamical (MD) method, in which both of the
longitudinal as well as transverse motions of the chain atoms in the SWNT have
been permitted. It is found that the thermal conductivity $\kappa $ of the
carbon nanowire is very high at room temperature, and diverges more likely with
the chain length logarithmically.
"
What is the role of attosecond pulses in resolving the dynamics of a core hole in a rare-gas cluster?,"  Attosecond laser pulses open the door to resolve microscopic electron
dynamics in time. Experiments performed include the decay of a core hole, the
time-resolved measurement of photo ionization and electron tunneling. The
processes investigated share the coherent character of the dynamics involving
very few, ideally one active electron. Here, we introduce a scheme to probe
dissipative multi-electron motion in time. In this context attosecond probing
enables one to obtain information which is lost at later times and cannot be
retrieved by conventional methods in the energy domain due to the incoherent
nature of the dynamics. As a specific example we will discuss the charging of a
rare-gas cluster during a strong femtosecond pulse with attosecond pulses. The
example illustrates the proposed use of attosecond pulses and suggests an
experimental resolution of a controversy about the mechanism of energy
absorption by rare-gas clusters in strong vacuum-ultraviolet (VUV) pulses.
"
What are the most powerful results of mathematical statistics that are of increasing importance in statistical mechanics?,"  Some of the more powerful results of mathematical statistics are becoming of
increasing importance in statistical mechanics. Here the use of the central
limit theorem in conjunction with the canonical ensemble is shown to lead to an
interesting and important new insight into results associated with the
canonical ensemble. This theoretical work is illustrated numerically and it is
shown how this numerical work can form the basis of an undergraduate laboratory
experiment which should help to implant ideas of statistical mechanics in
students' minds.
"
What are the key algorithms used in the FROST package for solving the PTP?,"  The fold recognition methods are promissing tools for capturing the structure
of a protein by its amino acid residues sequence but their use is still
restricted by the needs of huge computational resources and suitable efficient
algorithms as well. In the recent version of FROST (Fold Recognition Oriented
Search Tool) package the most efficient algorithm for solving the Protein
Threading Problem (PTP) is implemented due to the strong collaboration between
the SYMBIOSE group in IRISA and MIG in Jouy-en-Josas. In this paper, we present
the diverse components of FROST, emphasizing on the recent advances in
formulating and solving new versions of the PTP and on the way of solving on a
computer cluster a million of instances in a easonable time.
"
What is the impact of the interaction between excitons and surface plasmons in a substrate?,"  We discuss coherent exciton-polariton states in long molecular chains that
are formed due to the interaction of molecular excitations with both vacuum
photons and surface excitations of the neighboring reflecting substrate. The
resonance coupling with surface plasmons (or surface polaritons) of the
substrate can substantially contribute to the retarded intermolecular
interactions leading to an efficient channel of the decay of one-dimensional
excitons with small momenta via emission of surface excitations. The interface
also modifies the radiative decay of excitons into vacuum photons. In an
idealized system, excitons with higher momenta would not emit photons nor
surface waves. For a dissipative substrate, additional exciton quenching takes
place owing to Joule losses as the electric field of the exciton polarization
penetrates the substrate. We discuss how these effects depend on the
polarization of molecular excitations, their frequency and on the distance of
the chain from the substrate.
"
What are the generating functions of certain pattern classes in the maximally clustered permutations?,"  The maximally clustered permutations are characterized by avoiding the
classical permutation patterns 3421, 4312, and 4321. This class contains the
freely-braided permutations and the fully-commutative permutations. In this
work, we show that the generating functions for certain fully-commutative
pattern classes can be transformed to give generating functions for the
corresponding freely-braided and maximally clustered pattern classes. Moreover,
this transformation of generating functions is rational. As a result, we obtain
enumerative formulas for the pattern classes mentioned above as well as the
corresponding hexagon-avoiding pattern classes where the hexagon-avoiding
permutations are characterized by avoiding 46718235, 46781235, 56718234, and
56781234.
"
How is the form factor bootstrap compared to the truncated conformal space approach?,"  We describe the volume dependence of matrix elements of local fields to all
orders in inverse powers of the volume (i.e. only neglecting contributions that
decay exponentially with volume). Using the scaling Lee-Yang model and the
Ising model in a magnetic field as testing ground, we compare them to matrix
elements extracted in finite volume using truncated conformal space approach to
exact form factors obtained using the bootstrap method. We obtain solid
confirmation for the form factor bootstrap, which is different from all
previously available tests in that it is a non-perturbative and direct
comparison of exact form factors to multi-particle matrix elements of local
operators, computed from the Hamiltonian formulation of the quantum field
theory. We also demonstrate that combining form factor bootstrap and truncated
conformal space is an effective method for evaluating finite volume form
factors in integrable field theories over the whole range in volume.
"
What is the effect of the electron chemical potential on the intrinsic orbital magnetization in antiferromagnets?,"  We study the intrinsic orbital magnetization (OM) in antiferromagnets on the
distorted face-centered-cubic lattice. The combined lattice distortion and spin
frustration induce nontrivial $k$-space Chern invariant, which turns to result
in profound effects on the OM properties. We derive a specific relation between
the OM and the Hall conductivity, according to which it is found that the
intrinsic OM vanishes when the electron chemical potential lies in the Mott
gap. The distinct behavior of the intrinsic OM in the metallic and insulating
regions is shown. The Berry phase effects on the thermoelectric transport is
also discussed.
"
What are the main features of the high-pressure transport in a beta-pyrochlore superconductor?,"  We performed high-pressure transport measurements on high-quality single
crystals of KOs2O6, a beta-pyrochlore superconductor. While the resistivity at
high temperatures might approach saturation, there is no sign of saturation at
low temperatures, down to the superconducting phase. The anomalous resistivity
is accompanied by a nonmetallic behavior in the thermoelectric power (TEP) up
to temperatures of at least 700 K, which also exhibits a broad hump with a
maximum at 60 K. The pressure influences mostly the low-energy electronic
excitations. A simple band model based on enhanced density of states in a
narrow window around the Fermi energy (EF) explains the main features of this
unconventional behavior in the transport coefficients and its evolution under
pressure.
"
What is the significance of the GL model in reproducing the field profile near the vortex cores?,"  Local magnetic field distribution B(r) in the mixed state of a boride
superconductor, YB6, is studied by muon spin rotation (muSR). A comparative
analysis using the modified London model and Ginzburg-Landau (GL) model
indicates that the GL model exhibits better agreement with muSR data at higher
fields, thereby demonstrating the importance of reproducing the field profile
near the vortex cores when the intervortex distance becomes closer to the GL
coherence length. The temperature and field dependence of magnetic penetration
depth ($\lambda$) does not show any hint of nonlocal effect nor of low-lying
quasiparticle excitation. This suggests that the strong coupling of electrons
to the rattling motion of Y ions in the boron cage suggested by bulk
measurements gives rise to a conventional superconductivity with isotropic
s-wave pairing. Taking account of the present result, a review is provided for
probing the anisotropy of superconducting order parameters by the slope of
$\lambda$ against field.
"
What is the value of the critical exponent for the Gross-Pitaevskii equation?,"  The $s=1$ spinor Bose condensate at zero temperature supports ferromagnetic
and polar phases that combine magnetic and superfluid ordering. We investigate
the formation of magnetic domains at finite temperature and magnetic field in
two dimensions in an optical trap. We study the general ground state phase
diagram of a spin-1 system and focus on a phase that has a magnetic Ising order
parameter and numerically determine the nature of the finite temperature
superfluid and magnetic phase transitions. We then study three different
dynamical models: model A, which has no conserved quantities, model F, which
has a conserved second sound mode and the Gross-Pitaevskii (GP) equation which
has a conserved density and magnetization. We find the dynamic critical
exponent to be the same for models A and F ($z=2$) but different for GP ($z
\approx 3$). Externally imposed magnetization conservation in models A and F
yields the value $z \approx 3$, which demonstrates that the only conserved
density relevant to domain formation is the magnetization density.

What are the categories of pseudoknot structures by their maximal sets of mutually intersecting arcs?,"  In this paper we derive the generating function of RNA structures with
pseudoknots. We enumerate all $k$-noncrossing RNA pseudoknot structures
categorized by their maximal sets of mutually intersecting arcs. In addition we
enumerate pseudoknot structures over circular RNA. For 3-noncrossing RNA
structures and RNA secondary structures we present a novel 4-term recursion
formula and a 2-term recursion, respectively. Furthermore we enumerate for
arbitrary $k$ all $k$-noncrossing, restricted RNA structures i.e.
$k$-noncrossing RNA structures without 2-arcs i.e. arcs of the form $(i,i+2)$,
for $1\le i\le n-2$.
"
What is the importance of the local behavior of kinetic energy density functionals in assessing the quality of the functionals?,"  There is a number of explicit kinetic energy density functionals for
non-interacting electron systems that are obtained in terms of the electron
density and its derivatives. These semilocal functionals have been widely used
in the literature. In this work we present a comparative study of the kinetic
energy density of these semilocal functionals, stressing the importance of the
local behavior to assess the quality of the functionals. We propose a quality
factor that measures the local differences between the usual orbital-based
kinetic energy density distributions and the approximated ones, allowing to
ensure if the good results obtained for the total kinetic energies with these
semilocal functionals are due to their correct local performance or to error
cancellations. We have also included contributions coming from the laplacian of
the electron density to work with an infinite set of kinetic energy densities.
For all the functionals but one we have found that their success in the
evaluation of the total kinetic energy are due to global error cancellations,
whereas the local behavior of their kinetic energy density becomes worse than
that corresponding to the Thomas-Fermi functional.
"
What is the intrinsic characterization of dynamically critical points for dissipative surface maps?,"  We give an alternative proof of the Benedicks-Carleson theorem on the
existence of strange attractors in H\'enon-like families in the plane. To
bypass a huge inductive argument, we introduce an induction-free explicit
definition of dynamically critical points. The argument is sufficiently general
and in particular applies to the case of non-invertible maps as well. It
naturally raises the question of an intrinsic characterization of dynamically
critical points for dissipative surface maps.
"
What is the photovoltage technique used to measure spin excitations in a ferromagnetic microstrip?,"  This paper has been withdrawn by the authors due to the violation of ATLAS
experiment publication policy.
"
What are the implications of cloning of orthogonal but genuinely entangled three qubit states?,"  We discuss (im)possibility of the exact cloning of orthogonal but genuinely
entangled three qubit states aided with entangled ancila under local operation
and classical communication. Whereas any two orthogonal GHZ states taken from
the canonical GHZ basis, can be cloned with the help of a known GHZ state,
surprisingly we find that no two W states can be cloned by using any known
three qubit (possibly entangled) state as blank copy.
"
What is the key feature of the Evolutionary Neural Gas (ENG) model that allows it to adapt to the environment?,"  Despite their claimed biological plausibility, most self organizing networks
have strict topological constraints and consequently they cannot take into
account a wide range of external stimuli. Furthermore their evolution is
conditioned by deterministic laws which often are not correlated with the
structural parameters and the global status of the network, as it should happen
in a real biological system. In nature the environmental inputs are noise
affected and fuzzy. Which thing sets the problem to investigate the possibility
of emergent behaviour in a not strictly constrained net and subjected to
different inputs. It is here presented a new model of Evolutionary Neural Gas
(ENG) with any topological constraints, trained by probabilistic laws depending
on the local distortion errors and the network dimension. The network is
considered as a population of nodes that coexist in an ecosystem sharing local
and global resources. Those particular features allow the network to quickly
adapt to the environment, according to its dimensions. The ENG model analysis
shows that the net evolves as a scale-free graph, and justifies in a deeply
physical sense- the term gas here used.
"
What is the Yang-Baxter algebra used to derive the eigenvalues of the XXZ model?,"  In this work we consider a functional method in the theory of exactly
solvable models based on the Yang-Baxter algebra. Using this method we derive
the eigenvalues of the XXZ model with non-diagonal twisted and open boundary
conditions for general values of the anisotropy and boundary parameters.
"
What are the effects of the upper bound on the dissociation temperatures of quarkonium states for the quark-gluon condensate?,"  We predict the upper bound on the dissociation temperatures of different
quarkonium states.
"
What is the relationship between the N2H+ emission and the thermal dust continuum emission in the protostellar cores?,"  We present the results of an interferometric study of the N2H+(1--0) emission
from nine nearby, isolated, low-mass protostellar cores, using the OVRO
millimeter array. The main goal of this study is the kinematic characterization
of the cores in terms of rotation, turbulence, and fragmentation. Eight of the
nine objects have compact N2H+ cores with FWHM radii of 1200 -- 3500 AU,
spatially coinciding with the thermal dust continuum emission. The only more
evolved (Class I) object in the sample (CB 188) shows only faint and extended
N2H+ emission. The mean N2H+ line width was found to be 0.37 km/s. Estimated
virial masses range from 0.3 to 1.2 M_sun. We find that thermal and turbulent
energy support are about equally important in these cores, while rotational
support is negligible. The measured velocity gradients across the cores range
from 6 to 24 km/s/pc. Assuming these gradients are produced by bulk rotation,
we find that the specific angular momenta of the observed Class 0 protostellar
cores are intermediate between those of dense (prestellar) molecular cloud
cores and the orbital angular momenta of wide PMS binary systems. There appears
to be no evolution (decrease) of angular momentum from the smallest prestellar
cores via protostellar cores to wide PMS binary systems. In the context that
most protostellar cores are assumed to fragment and form binary stars, this
means that most of the angular momentum contained in the collapse region is
transformed into orbital angular momentum of the resulting stellar binary
systems.
"
What are the Lorentz violating counterterms in the Yang-Mills theory?,"  It has been known for some time that the standard MHV diagram formulation of
perturbative Yang-Mills theory is incomplete, as it misses rational terms in
one-loop scattering amplitudes of pure Yang-Mills. We propose that certain
Lorentz violating counterterms, when expressed in the field variables which
give rise to standard MHV vertices, produce precisely these missing terms.
These counterterms appear when Yang-Mills is treated with a regulator,
introduced by Thorn and collaborators, which arises in worldsheet formulations
of Yang-Mills theory in the lightcone gauge. As an illustration of our
proposal, we show that a simple one-loop, two-point counterterm is the
generating function for the infinite sequence of one-loop, all-plus helicity
amplitudes in pure Yang-Mills, in complete agreement with known expressions.
"
What is the complexity of propositional proof systems extended by allowing disjunctions of linear equations?,"  We develop and study the complexity of propositional proof systems of varying
strength extending resolution by allowing it to operate with disjunctions of
linear equations instead of clauses. We demonstrate polynomial-size refutations
for hard tautologies like the pigeonhole principle, Tseitin graph tautologies
and the clique-coloring tautologies in these proof systems. Using the
(monotone) interpolation by a communication game technique we establish an
exponential-size lower bound on refutations in a certain, considerably strong,
fragment of resolution over linear equations, as well as a general polynomial
upper bound on (non-monotone) interpolants in this fragment.
  We then apply these results to extend and improve previous results on
multilinear proofs (over fields of characteristic 0), as studied in
[RazTzameret06]. Specifically, we show the following:
  1. Proofs operating with depth-3 multilinear formulas polynomially simulate a
certain, considerably strong, fragment of resolution over linear equations.
  2. Proofs operating with depth-3 multilinear formulas admit polynomial-size
refutations of the pigeonhole principle and Tseitin graph tautologies. The
former improve over a previous result that established small multilinear proofs
only for the \emph{functional} pigeonhole principle. The latter are different
than previous proofs, and apply to multilinear proofs of Tseitin mod p graph
tautologies over any field of characteristic 0.
  We conclude by connecting resolution over linear equations with extensions of
the cutting planes proof system.
"
What are the key issues with existing Monte Carlo methods for pricing continuous arithmetic average Asian options?,"  Taking advantage of the recent litterature on exact simulation algorithms
(Beskos, Papaspiliopoulos and Roberts) and unbiased estimation of the
expectation of certain fonctional integrals (Wagner, Beskos et al. and
Fearnhead et al.), we apply an exact simulation based technique for pricing
continuous arithmetic average Asian options in the Black and Scholes framework.
Unlike existing Monte Carlo methods, we are no longer prone to the
discretization bias resulting from the approximation of continuous time
processes through discrete sampling. Numerical results of simulation studies
are presented and variance reduction problems are considered.
"
What are the supersymmetric mass bounds in chargino-neutralino decays?,"  We analyze the charge-parity (CP) asymmetry in the charged Higgs boson decays
to chargino-neutralino pairs, H^- -> chargino_i + neutralino_j. We show first
that these modes have a large branching ratio for m_H^- > 600 GeV. We use
Cutkosky rules to obtain the analytical formulas needed for the evaluation of
the asymmetry under consideration. We then calculate the CP asymmetry in
chargino-neutralino decays by including supersymmetric mass bounds, as well as
constraints from b -> s gamma, (g-2)_mu, Delta\rho and electric dipole moments.
Finally, we discuss observability of the asymmetry at the LHC by calculating
the number of required charged Higgs events to observe the asymmetry for each
decay channel. We show that the inclusion of constraints considerably reduces
the projected CP asymmetry, and that the optimal channel for observing the
asymmetry is H^- -> chargino_1 + neutralino_2.
"
What is the relativistic plasma model of quark-antiquark plasma?,"  We investigate fully nonlinear, non-Abelian excitations of quark-antiquark
plasma, using relativistic fluid theory in cold plasma approximation. There are
mainly three important nonlinearities, coming from various sources such as
non-Abelian interactions of Yang-Mills (YM) fields, Wong's color dynamics and
plasma nonlinearity, in our model. By neglecting nonlinearities due to plasma
and color dynamics we get back the earlier results of Blaizot {\it et. al.},
Phys. Rev. Lett. 72, 3317 (1994). Similarly, by neglecting YM fields
nonlinearity and plasma nonlinearity, it reduces to the model of Gupta {\it et.
al.}, Phys. Lett. B498, 223 (2005). Thus we have the most general non-Abelian
mode of quark-gluon plasma (QGP). Further, our model resembles the problem of
propagation of laser beam through relativistic plasma, Physica 9D, 96 (1983).
in the absence of all non-Abelian interactions.
"
What are the systematic errors of the ground-state parameters obtained by the Shifman-Vainshtein-Zakharov (SVZ) sum rules?,"  We study systematic errors of the ground-state parameters obtained by
Shifman-Vainshtein-Zakharov (SVZ) sum rules, making use of the
harmonic-oscillator potential model as an example. In this case, one knows the
exact solution for the polarization operator, which allows one to obtain both
the OPE to any order and the parameters (masses and decay constants) of the
bound states. We determine the parameters of the ground state making use of the
standard procedures of the method of sum rules, and compare the obtained
results with the known exact values. We show that in the situation when the
continuum contribution to the polarization operator is not known and is
modelled by an effective continuum, the method of sum rules does not allow to
control the systematic uncertainties of the extracted ground-state parameters.
"
What is the infrared response of the quasi-one-dimensional organic conductor (TMTSF)2$SO3 measured as a function of temperature?,"  We present measurements of the infrared response of the quasi-one-dimensional
organic conductor (TMTSF)2$SO3 along (E||a) and perpendicular (E||b') to the
stacking axis as a function of temperature. Above the metal-insulator
transition related to the anion ordering the optical conductivity spectra show
a Drude-like response. Below the transition an energy gap of about 1500 cm-1
(185 meV) opens, leading to the corresponding charge transfer band in the
optical conductivity spectra. The analysis of the infrared-active vibrations
gives evidence for the long-range crystal structure modulation below the
transition temperature and for the short-range order fluctuations of the
lattice modulation above the transition temperature. Also we report about a new
infrared mode at around 710 cm-1 with a peculiar temperature behavior, which
has so far not been observed in any other (TMTSF)2X salt showing a
metal-insulator transition. A qualitative model based on the coupling between
the TMTSF molecule vibration and the reorientation of electrical dipole moment
of the FSO3 anion is proposed, in order to explain the anomalous behavior of
the new mode.
"
"What are the base properties of βω - ω, especially the Noetherian type Nt(βω-ω)?","  Extending some results of Malykhin, we prove several independence results
about base properties of $\beta\omega-\omega$ and its powers, especially the
Noetherian type $Nt(\beta\omega-\omega)$, the least $\kappa$ for which
$\beta\omega-\omega$ has a base that is $\kappa$-like with respect to
containment. For example, $Nt(\beta\omega-\omega)$ is never less than the
splitting number, but can consistently be that $\omega_1$, $2^\omega$,
$(2^\omega)^+$, or strictly between $\omega_1$ and $2^\omega$.
$Nt(\beta\omega-\omega)$ is also consistently less than the additivity of the
meager ideal. $Nt(\beta\omega-\omega)$ is closely related to the existence of
special kinds of splitting families.
"
What is the PSD function used to specify seismometer performance?,"  The power spectral density (PSD) function is commonly used to specify
seismometer performance. It is derived from the FFT of acceleration and
correction is made for the transfer function of the instrument that generated
the data. As with any such spectrum of density (`per Hz') type, the noise
inherent to a PSD is large. This article illustrates the value of a function
that is derived from the PSD and for which the influence of noise is
significantly reduced. Called the cumulative spectral power (CSP), it is
obtained from the PSD through the noise-reducing process of integration. The
maximum of the CSP (corresponding to the longest graphed value of the period)
provides a means for estimating the total vibrational power of the earth. The
present author has significantly simplified the process of PSD generation. Thus
routine graphing is straightforwared-of first the FFT, followed by the
generation of both a PSD and its associated CSP. The unique properties of the
CSP make it valuable for the study of a variety of earth dynamics. For example,
the strking simplicity of a CSP graph generated from a record containing a
strong teleseismic earthquake is undoubtedly important to the development and
refinement of any viable theory of earthquake dynamics.
"
What are the implications of the DLA abundance patterns for the formation of high-redshift galaxies?,"  We obtained comprehensive sets of elemental abundances for eleven damped
Ly-alpha systems (DLAs) at z_DLA=1.7-2.5. In Paper I of this series, we showed
for three DLA galaxies that we can derive their star formation histories and
ages from a detailed comparison of their intrinsic abundance patterns with
chemical evolution models. We determine in this paper the star formation
properties of six additional DLA galaxies. The derived results confirm that no
single star formation history explains the diverse sets of abundance patterns
in DLAs. We demonstrate that the various star formation histories reproducing
the DLA abundance patterns are typical of local irregular, dwarf starburst and
quiescent spiral galaxies. Independent of the star formation history, the DLAs
have a common characteristic of being weak star forming galaxies; models with
high star formation efficiencies are ruled out. All the derived DLA star
formation rates per unit area are moderate or low, with values between -3.2 <
log SFR < -1.1 M_sol yr^{-1} kpc^{-2}. The DLA abundance patterns require a
large spread in ages ranging from 20 Myr up to 3 Gyr. The oldest DLA in our
sample is observed at z_DLA=1.864 with an age estimated to more than 3 Gyr; it
nicely indicates that galaxies were already forming at z_f>10. But, most of the
DLAs show ages much younger than that of the Universe at the epoch of
observation. Young galaxies thus seem to populate the high redshift Universe at
z>2, suggesting relatively low redshifts of formation (z~3) for most
high-redshift galaxies. The DLA star formation properties are compared with
those of other high-redshift galaxies identified in deep imaging surveys with
the aim of obtaining a global picture of high-redshift objects.
"
What is the difference between the relativistically blurred photoionized reflection model and the relativistically smeared ionized absorption model in describing the spectral variability of Mkr 841?,"  Mkr 841 is a bright Seyfert 1 galaxy known to harbor a strong soft excess and
a variable K$\alpha$ iron line. It has been observed during 3 different periods
by XMM for a total cumulated exposure time of $\sim$108 ks. We present in this
paper a broad band spectral analysis of the complete EPIC-pn data sets. We were
able to test two different models for the soft excess, a relativistically
blurred photoionized reflection (\r model) and a relativistically smeared
ionized absorption (\a model). The continuum is modeled by a simple cut-off
power law and we also add a neutral reflection. These observations reveal the
extreme and puzzling spectral and temporal behaviors of the soft excess and
iron line. The 0.5-3 keV soft X-ray flux decreases by a factor 3 between 2001
and 2005 and the line shape appears to be a mixture of broad and narrow
components. We succeed in describing this complex broad-band 0.5-10 keV
spectral variability using either \r or \a to fit the soft excess. Both models
give statistically equivalent results even including simultaneous BeppoSAX data
up to 200 keV. Both models are consistent with the presence of remote
reflection characterized by a constant narrow component in the data. However
they differ in the presence of a broad line component present in \r but not
needed in \a. This study also reveals the sporadic presence of relativistically
redshifted narrow iron lines.
"
What are the physical effects of the Gauss-Bonnet term for a black hole?,"  We show that the Gauss-Bonnet term can have physical effects in four
dimensions. Specifically, the entropy of a black hole acquires a correction
that is proportional to the Euler characteristic of the cross sections of the
horizon. While this term is constant for a single black hole, it will be a
non-trivial function for a system with dynamical topologies such as black-hole
mergers: it is shown that for certain values of the GB parameter, the second
law of black-hole mechanics can be violated.
"
What is the relationship between the ideals in the ring of Colombeau generalized numbers?,"  In this paper, the structure of the ideals in the ring of Colombeau
generalized numbers is investigated. Connections with the theories of exchange
rings, Gelfand rings and lattice-ordered rings are given. Characterizations for
prime, projective, pure and topologically closed ideals are given, answering in
particular the questions about prime ideals in [Aragona-Juriaans]. Also
z-ideals in the sense of [Mason] are characterized. The quotient rings modulo
maximal ideals are shown to be canonically isomorphic with nonstandard fields
of asymptotic numbers. Finally, a detailed study of the ideals allows us to
prove that (under some set-theoretic assumption) the Hahn-Banach extension
property does not hold for a large class of topological modules over the ring
of Colombeau generalized numbers.
"
What are the conditions on the size and shape of the initial datum for the large time asymptotics of solutions?,"  The large time behavior of zero mass solutions to the Cauchy problem for a
convection-diffusion equation. We provide conditions on the size and shape of
the initial datum such that the large time asymptotics of solutions is given
either by the derivative of the Guass-Weierstrass kernel or by a self-similar
solution or by a hyperbolic N-wave
"
What are the physical conditions that define the molecular line emission in galaxies?,"  ALMA will be able to detect a broad spectrum of molecular lines in galaxies.
Current aperture synthesis observations indicate that the molecular line
emission from galaxies is remarkably variable, even on kpc scales. Imaging
spectroscopy at resolutions of an arcsecond or better will reduce the chemical
complexity by allowing regions of physical conditions to be defined and
classified.
"
What are the results of a 2003 Chandra ACIS-I observation of SN1978K?,"  We describe the results of a 2003 Chandra ACIS-I observation of SN1978K. The
spectrum shows little flux below 0.6 keV, in contrast to the 2002 ACIS-S
observation that showed flux to 0.4 keV. Fitting the ACIS-I spectrum alone
leads to two solutions depending upon the value of the column density. A joint
fit using a dual thermal plasma model applied to the ACIS-I and a
contemporaneous XMM spectrum, which if fit alone also leads to a two-column
solution, yields a single column density fit. The fitted temperature of the
joint fit for the soft component remains constant with the errors from previous
Chandra, XMM, and ASCA data. The hard temperature recovers from its 2000-2002
decline and corresponds to an increase in the column density during that time.
The hard (2-10 keV) light curve is confirmed to be declining. The derived
number density represents a lower limit of 1e5 depending upon the adopted
filling factor of the emitting volume, leading to an estimated mass cooling
rate of 0.1-0.15 solar masses per year.
"
What is the Randall-Sundrum II model in the context of brane cosmology?,"  Assisted chaotic inflation in brane cosmology is discussed. We work in the
framework of Randall-Sundrum (RS) II model, in which adopting the RS condition
the only parameter is the five-dimensional Planck mass. Using the scalar
spectral index and the amplitude of scalar perturbations we determine both the
mass of the scalar fields responsible for inflation and the fundamental Planck
mass of the higher-dimensional theory. We find that the mass of the scalars has
the typical value of the inflaton mass in chaotic inflation ($M_I \sim 10^{13}$
GeV) and that the five-dimensional Planck mass is very close to the GUT (Grand
Unified Theories) scale ($M_5 \sim (10^{16}-10^{17})$ GeV). Furthermore, no
matter how many scalar fields we use it is not possible to have chaotic
inflation with field values below the fundamental Planck mass.
"
What is the objective of the AMADEUS experiment?,"  The change of the hadron masses and hadron interactions in the nuclear medium
and the structure of cold dense hadronic matter are hot topics of hadron
physics today. These important, yet unsolved, problems will be the research
field of AMADEUS (Antikaonic Matter At DAFNE: Experiments with Unraveling
Spectroscopy) - new experiment proposal at DAFNE accelerator at LNF-INFN.
AMADEUS will search for antikaon-mediated deeply bound nuclear states produced
in helium by stopping K- from DAFNE, both in the formation and in the decay
processes.
"
What is the comparison of the performance of ANNs and SVMs in predicting water demand?,"  Water plays a pivotal role in many physical processes, and most importantly
in sustaining human life, animal life and plant life. Water supply entities
therefore have the responsibility to supply clean and safe water at the rate
required by the consumer. It is therefore necessary to implement mechanisms and
systems that can be employed to predict both short-term and long-term water
demands. The increasingly growing field of computational intelligence
techniques has been proposed as an efficient tool in the modelling of dynamic
phenomena. The primary objective of this paper is to compare the efficiency of
two computational intelligence techniques in water demand forecasting. The
techniques under comparison are the Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and the
Support Vector Machines (SVMs). In this study it was observed that the ANNs
perform better than the SVMs. This performance is measured against the
generalisation ability of the two.
"
This paper was withdrawn due to the results of new investigations that,"  This paper had been withdrawn because the prime reported effect had not been
confirmed in further investigations (see arXiv:0812.4488 [hep-lat]).
"
What is the field-theoretical approach used to investigate vortices in two-dimensional superconductors?,"  The Beresinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) physics of vortices in
two-dimensional superconductors at finite magnetic field is investigated by
means of a field-theoretical approach based on the sine-Gordon model. This
description leads to a straightforward definition of the field-induced
magnetization and shows that the persistence of non-linear effects at low
fields above the transition is a typical signature of the fast divergence of
the correlation length within the BKT theory.
"
What is the generalized Sombrero-shaped potentials in N-dimensional space?,"  Based on an iterative method for solving the goundstate of Schroedinger
equation, it is found that a kind of generalized Sombrero-shaped potentials in
N-dimensional space has groundstates with zero eigenvalue. The restrictions on
the parameters in the potential are discussed.
"
What are the key concepts in a spherically symmetric loop quantum gravity?,"  We show that holography arises naturally in the context of spherically
symmetric loop quantum gravity. The result is not dependent on detailed
assumptions about the dynamics of the theory being considered. It ties strongly
the amount of information contained in a region of space to the tight
mathematical underpinnings of loop quantum geometry, at least in this
particular context.
"
What are the Weyl manifolds that are not conformally flat or locally symmetric?,"  This is a final step in a local classification of pseudo-Riemannian manifolds
with parallel Weyl tensor that are not conformally flat or locally symmetric.
"
What are the regions of the sky that will be surveyed by the Arecibo L-band Feed Array Zone of Avoidance Survey (ALFA ZOA)?,"  The Arecibo L-band Feed Array Zone of Avoidance Survey (ALFA ZOA) will map
1350-1800 square degrees at low Galactic latitude, providing HI spectra for
galaxies in regions of the sky where our knowledge of local large scale
structure remains incomplete, owing to obscuration from dust and high stellar
confusion near the Galactic plane. Because of these effects, a substantial
fraction of the galaxies detected in the survey will have no optical or
infrared counterparts. However, near infrared follow up observations of ALFA
ZOA sources found in regions of lowest obscuration could reveal whether some of
these sources could be objects in which little or no star formation has taken
place (""dark galaxies""). We present here the results of ALFA ZOA precursor
observations on two patches of sky totaling 140 square degrees (near l=40
degrees, and l=192 degrees). We have measured HI parameters for detections from
these observations, and cross-correlated with the NASA/IPAC Extragalactic
Database (NED). A significant fraction of the objects have never been detected
at any wavelength. For those galaxies that have been previously detected, a
significant fraction have no previously known redshift, and no previous HI
detection.
"
What is the combination of interferometer techniques used for gravitational wave detection?,"  We report on the experimental combination of three advanced interferometer
techniques for gravitational wave detection, namely power-recycling, detuned
signal-recycling and squeezed field injection. For the first time we
experimentally prove the compatibility of especially the latter two. To achieve
a broadband non-classical sensitivity improvement we applied a filter cavity
for compensation of quadrature rotation. Signal to noise ratio was improved by
up to 2.8 dB beyond the coherent state's shot noise. The complete set-up was
stably locked for arbitrary times and characterized by injected single-sideband
modulation fields.
"
Can neutrinos oscillate even if they are massless?,"  We show that the massive (or massless) neutrinos can be described as special
states of Heisenberg nonlinear spinors. As a by-product of this decomposition a
particularly attractive consequence appears: the possibility of relating the
existence of only three species of mass-less neutrinos to such internal
non-linear structure. At the same time it allows the possibility that neutrino
oscillation can occurs even for massless neutrinos.
"
What are the main implications of the basic rough set idea for handling missing data?,"  Many techniques for handling missing data have been proposed in the
literature. Most of these techniques are overly complex. This paper explores an
imputation technique based on rough set computations. In this paper,
characteristic relations are introduced to describe incompletely specified
decision tables.It is shown that the basic rough set idea of lower and upper
approximations for incompletely specified decision tables may be defined in a
variety of different ways. Empirical results obtained using real data are given
and they provide a valuable and promising insight to the problem of missing
data. Missing data were predicted with an accuracy of up to 99%.
"
What is the class of Grassmann integrals used to expand a hypergraph in terms of spanning hyperforests?,"  Given a hypergraph G, we introduce a Grassmann algebra over the vertex set,
and show that a class of Grassmann integrals permits an expansion in terms of
spanning hyperforests. Special cases provide the generating functions for
rooted and unrooted spanning (hyper)forests and spanning (hyper)trees. All
these results are generalizations of Kirchhoff's matrix-tree theorem.
Furthermore, we show that the class of integrals describing unrooted spanning
(hyper)forests is induced by a theory with an underlying OSP(1|2)
supersymmetry.
"
What are the three different exchange terms in the Born kernel of the NN interaction?,"  We calculate n alpha phase-shifts and scattering observables in the
resonating-group method, using the nuclear-matter G-matrix of an SU_6
quark-model NN interaction. The G-matrix is generated in the recent
energy-independent procedure of the quark-model NN interaction with the
continuous prescription for intermediate spectra, by assuming an appropriate
Fermi momentum k_F=1.2 fm^-1. The n alpha RGM interaction kernels are evaluated
with explicit treatments of the nonlocality and momentum dependence of
partial-wave G-matrix components. The momentum dependence of the G-matrix
components is different for each of the nucleon-exchange and interaction types.
Without introducing any artificial parameters except for k_F, the central and
spin-orbit components of the n alpha Born kernel are found to have reasonable
strengths under the assumption of a rigid translationally invariant shell-model
wave function of the alpha-cluster. The characteristic behaviors of three
different exchange terms, corresponding to knockout, heavy-particle pickup and
nucleon-rearrangement processes, are essentially the same between the case of
previous local effective NN forces and the case of nonlocal G-matrix NN
interactions.
"
What are the results of the optimal design problem related to the function $\lambda_1$?,"  In this paper we find estimates for the optimal constant in the critical
Sobolev trace inequality $\lambda_1(\Omega)\|u\|_{L^1(\partial\Omega)} \le
\|u\|_{W^{1,1}(\Omega)}$ that are independent of $\Omega$. This estimates
generalize those of \cite{BS} concerning the $p$-Laplacian to the case $p=1$.
  We apply our results to prove existence of an extremal for this embedding. We
then study an optimal design problem related to $\lambda_1$, and eventually
compute the shape derivative of the functional $\Omega\to\lambda_1(\Omega)$. As
a consequence, we obtain that a ball of $\R^n$ of radius $n$ is critical for
volume-preserving deformations.
"
What is the behavior of Ising models on random graphs that converge to a tree?,"  Consider a collection of random variables attached to the vertices of a
graph. The reconstruction problem requires to estimate one of them given `far
away' observations. Several theoretical results (and simple algorithms) are
available when their joint probability distribution is Markov with respect to a
tree. In this paper we consider the case of sequences of random graphs that
converge locally to trees. In particular, we develop a sufficient condition for
the tree and graph reconstruction problem to coincide. We apply such condition
to colorings of random graphs.
  Further, we characterize the behavior of Ising models on such graphs, both
with attractive and random interactions (respectively, `ferromagnetic' and
`spin glass').

What are the two atmospheric components in the model used to analyze wave modes in a sunspot penumbra?,"  Aims: The primary objective of this study is to search for and identify wave
modes within a sunspot penumbra.
  Methods: Infrared spectropolarimetric time series data are inverted using a
model comprising two atmospheric components in each spatial pixel. Fourier
phase difference analysis is performed on the line-of-sight velocities
retrieved from both components to determine time delays between the velocity
signals. In addition, the vertical separation between the signals in the two
components is calculated from the Stokes velocity response functions.
  Results: The inversion yields two atmospheric components, one permeated by a
nearly horizontal magnetic field, the other with a less-inclined magnetic
field. Time delays between the oscillations in the two components in the
frequency range 2.5-4.5 mHz are combined with speeds of atmospheric wave modes
to determine wave travel distances. These are compared to expected path lengths
obtained from response functions of the observed spectral lines in the
different atmospheric components. Fast-mode (i.e., modified p-mode) waves
exhibit the best agreement with the observations when propagating toward the
sunspot at an angle ~50 degrees to the vertical.
"
What are the implications of the packing anisotropy for the force network in the pentagon packing?,"  We perform a detailed analysis of the contact force network in a dense
confined packing of pentagonal particles simulated by means of the contact
dynamics method. The effect of particle shape is evidenced by comparing the
data from pentagon packing and from a packing with identical characteristics
except for the circular shape of the particles. A counterintuitive finding of
this work is that, under steady shearing, the pentagon packing develops a lower
structural anisotropy than the disk packing. We show that this weakness is
compensated by a higher force anisotropy, leading to enhanced shear strength of
the pentagon packing. We revisit ""strong"" and ""weak"" force networks in the
pentagon packing, but our simulation data provide also evidence for a large
class of ""very weak"" forces carried mainly by vertex-to-edge contacts. The
strong force chains are mostly composed of edge-to-edge contacts with a marked
zig-zag aspect and a decreasing exponential probability distribution as in a
disk packing.
"
What are the scaling properties of the intra-cluster medium in the XMM-Newton observations of RX J1347.5-1145?,"  We report on the analysis of XMM-Newton observations of RX J1347.5-1145
(z=0.451), the most X-ray-luminous galaxy cluster. We present a detailed total
and gas mass determination up to large distances (~1.7 Mpc), study the scaling
properties of the cluster, and explore the role of AGN heating in the cluster
cool core. By means of spatially resolved spectroscopy we derive density,
temperature, entropy, and cooling time profiles of the intra-cluster medium. We
compute the total mass profile of the cluster in the assumption of hydrostatic
equilibrium. If the disturbed south-east region of the cluster is excluded from
the analysis, our results on shape, normalization, scaling properties of
density, temperature, entropy, and cooling time profiles are fully consistent
with those of relaxed, cool core clusters. We compare our total and gas mass
estimates with previous X-ray, lensing, dynamical, and SZ studies. We find good
agreement with other X-ray results, dynamical mass measurements, weak lensing
masses and SZ results. We confirm a discrepancy of a factor ~2 between strong
lensing and X-ray mass determinations and find a gross mismatch between our
total mass estimate and the mass reconstructed through the combination of both
strong and weak lensing. We explore the effervescent heating scenario in the
core of RX J1347.5-1145 and find support to the picture that AGN outflows and
heat conduction are able to quenching radiative cooling.
"
What are the implications of the star-formation history in nuclear rings for the understanding of their physical conditions?,"  (Abridged) We present a study of the optical spectra of a sample of eight
star-forming nuclear rings and the nuclei of their host galaxies. The spectra
were obtained with the ISIS spectrograph on the William Herschel Telescope and
cover a wide range in wavelength, enabling the measurement of several stellar
absorption features and gas emission lines.
  We compared the strength of the absorption lines to a variety of population
synthesis models for the star-formation history in the nuclear rings, including
also the contribution of the older bulge and disc stellar components. We find
that the stars in our sample of nuclear rings have most likely formed over a
prolonged period of time characterised by episodic bursts of star-formation
activity. Constant star formation is firmly ruled out by the data, whereas a
one-off formation event is an unlikely explanation for a common galactic
component such as nuclear rings.
  We have used emission-line measurements to constrain the physical conditions
of the ionised gas within the rings. Emission in all nuclear rings originates
from HII-regions with electron densities typical for these kinds of objects,
and that the rings are characterised by values for the gas metallicity ranging
from slightly below to just above solar.
  As 20% of nearby spiral galaxies hosts nuclear rings that are currently
forming massive stars, our finding of an episodic star formation history in
nuclear rings implies that a significant population remains to be identified of
young nuclear rings that are not currently in a massive star formation phase.
"
What is the effect of an in-plane electric field on a homogeneous spin system?,"  Coupled spin-charge drift-diffusion equations are derived for a biased
two-dimensional electron gas with weak Rashba spin-orbit interaction. The basic
equations formally agree with recent results obtained for spin-orbit coupled
small polarons. It is shown that effects of an in-plane electric field on a
homogeneous spin system can completely be described by an associated in-plane
magnetic field. Exploiting this analogy, we predict among other things the
electric-field equivalent of the Hanle effect.
"
What are the effects of the favored fragmenting modes on the collective flow energy?,"  We include in statistical model calculations the facts that in the nuclear
multifragmentation process the fragments are produced within a given volume and
have a finite size. The corrections associated with these constraints affect
the partition modes and, as a consequence, other observables in the process. In
particular, we find that the favored fragmenting modes strongly suppress the
collective flow energy, leading to much lower values compared to what is
obtained from unconstrained calculations. This leads, for a given total
excitation energy, to a nontrivial correlation between the breakup temperature
and the collective expansion velocity. In particular we find that, under some
conditions, the temperature of the fragmenting system may increase as a
function of this expansion velocity, contrary to what it might be expected.

"What is the purpose of the space-based interferometry mission, SIM?","  The past two Decadal Surveys in Astronomy and Astrophysics recommended the
completion of a space-based interferometry mission, known today as SIM
PlanetQuest, for its unique ability to detect and characterize nearby rocky
planets (Bahcall 1991, McKee & Taylor 2001), as well as contributions to a
broad range of problems in astrophysics. Numerous committees of the National
Research Council as well as NASA Roadmaps have similarly highlighted SIM as the
one technology that offers detection and characterization of rocky planets
around nearby stars and which is technically ready. To date, SIM remains the
only program with the capability of detecting and confirming rocky planets in
the habitable zones of nearby solar-type stars. Moreover, SIM measures masses
and three-dimensional orbits of habitable planets around nearby stars (within
25 pc); these are the only stars for which follow-up by other techniques is
feasible, such as space-based spectroscopy, ground-based interferometry, and of
course TPF.
"
What are the characteristics of the bipolar nebulae observed with the VLA and ATCA telescopes?,"  We report our search for optically thick radio cores in sixteen narrow-waist
bipolar nebulae. Optically thick cores are a characteristic signature of
collimated ionized winds. Eleven northern nebulae were observed with the Very
Large Array (VLA) at 1.3 cm and 0.7 cm, and five southern nebulae were observed
with the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) at 6 cm and 3.6 cm. Two
northern objects, 19W32 and M 1-91, and three southern objects, He 2-25, He
2-84 and Mz 3, were found to exhibit a compact radio core with a rising
spectrum consistent with an ionized jet. Such jets have been seen in M 2-9 and
may be responsible for shaping bipolar structure in planetary nebulae.
"
What is the mechanism behind the change of the shape of the vortex core in a pinning-free superconductor?,"  With increasing applied current we show that the moving vortex lattice
changes its structure from a triangular one to a set of parallel vortex rows in
a pinning free superconductor. This effect originates from the change of the
shape of the vortex core due to non-equilibrium effects (similar to the
mechanism of vortex motion instability in the Larkin-Ovchinnikov theory). The
moving vortex creates a deficit of quasiparticles in front of its motion and an
excess of quasiparticles behind the core of the moving vortex. This results in
the appearance of a wake (region with suppressed order parameter) behind the
vortex which attracts other vortices resulting in an effective
direction-dependent interaction between vortices. When the vortex velocity $v$
reaches the critical value $v_c$ quasi-phase slip lines (lines with fast vortex
motion) appear which may coexist with slowly moving vortices between such
lines. Our results are found within the framework of the time-dependent
Ginzburg-Landau equations and are strictly valid when the coherence length
$\xi(T)$ is larger or comparable with the decay length $L_{in}$ of the
non-equilibrium quasiparticle distribution function. We qualitatively explain
experiments on the instability of vortex flow at low magnetic fields when the
distance between vortices $a \gg L_{in} \gg \xi (T)$. We speculate that a
similar instability of the vortex lattice should exist for $v>v_c$ even when
$a<L_{in}$.
"
What is the correlation energy of a dilute gas of neutral unpolarized fermionic atoms at zero temperature?,"  We consider a dilute gas of neutral unpolarized fermionic atoms at zero
temperature.The atoms interact via a short range (tunable) attractive
interaction. We demonstrate analytically a curious property of the gas at
unitarity. Namely, the correlation energy of the gas, evaluated by second order
perturbation theory, has the same density dependence as the first order
exchange energy, and the two almost exactly cancel each other at Feshbach
resonance irrespective of the shape of the potential, provided $(\mu r_s) >>
1$. Here $(\mu)^{-1}$ is the range of the two-body potential, and $r_s$ is
defined through the number density $n=3/(4\pi r_s^3)$. The implications of this
result for universality is discussed.
"
What are the benefits of using non-linear decision feedback multiuser detectors in a wireless data network?,"  This paper is focused on the cross-layer design problem of joint multiuser
detection and power control for energy-efficiency optimization in a wireless
data network through a game-theoretic approach. Building on work of Meshkati,
et al., wherein the tools of game-theory are used in order to achieve
energy-efficiency in a simple synchronous code division multiple access system,
system asynchronism, the use of bandlimited chip-pulses, and the multipath
distortion induced by the wireless channel are explicitly incorporated into the
analysis. Several non-cooperative games are proposed wherein users may vary
their transmit power and their uplink receiver in order to maximize their
utility, which is defined here as the ratio of data throughput to transmit
power. In particular, the case in which a linear multiuser detector is adopted
at the receiver is considered first, and then, the more challenging case in
which non-linear decision feedback multiuser detectors are employed is
considered. The proposed games are shown to admit a unique Nash equilibrium
point, while simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed
solutions, as well as that the use of a decision-feedback multiuser receiver
brings remarkable performance improvements.
"
What is the effect of quark fragmentation on the space-time development?,"  We propose a solution for the long standing puzzle of a too steeply falling
fragmentation function for a quark fragmenting into a pion, calculated by
Berger [1] in the Born approximation. Contrary to the simple anticipation that
gluon resummation worsens the problem, we find good agreement with data. Higher
quark Fock states slow down the quark, an effect which we call jet lag. It can
be also expressed in terms of vacuum energy loss. As a result, the space-time
development of the jet shrinks and the $z$-dependence becomes flatter than in
the Born approximation. The space-time pattern is also of great importance for
in-medium hadronization.
"
What are the threshold Reynolds numbers that can be reached in a Taylor-Couette flow?,"  We study liquid-liquid dispersions in a turbulent Taylor - Couette flow,
produced between two counterrotating coaxial cylinders. In pure Water and in
counterrotation, Reynolds numbers up to 1.4 10^5 are reached. We first
characterize the single-phase flow, in terms of threshold for transition to
turbulence, scaling of the torque and measurements of the mean flow and of the
Reynolds stress by stereoscopic PIV. We then study the increase of the
dissipation in the two-phase flows and find that the torque per unit mass can
be twice the torque for a single-phase flow. Long-time behaviours are also
reported.
"
What are the key findings of the observations of the H$_2$O and SiO maser emissions in the OH 231.8+4.2 preplanetary nebula?,"  OH 231.8+4.2 is a well studied preplanetary nebula (pPN) around a binary
stellar system that shows a remarkable bipolar outflow. To study the structure
and kinematics of the inner 10-80 AU nebular regions we performed
high-resolution observations of the H$_2$O 6$_{1,6}$--5$_{2,3}$ and $^{28}$SiO
$v$=2, $J$=1--0 maser emissions with the Very Long Baseline Array. The absolute
position of both emission distributions were recovered using the phase
referencing technique, and accurately registered in HST optical images. H$_2$O
maser clumps are found to be distributed in two areas of 20 mas in size
spatially displaced by $\sim$60 milli-arcseconds along an axis oriented nearly
north-south. SiO masers are tentatively found to be placed between the two
H$_2$O maser emitting regions, probably indicating the position of the Mira
component of the system. The SiO maser emission traces an inner equatorial
component with a diameter of 12 AU, probably a disk rotating around the M-type
star. Outwards, we detect in the H$_2$O data a pair of polar caps, separated by
80 AU. We believe that the inner regions of the nebula probably have been
altered by the presence of the companion, leading to an equator-to-pole density
contrast that may explain the lack of H$_2$O masers and strong SiO maser
emission in the denser, equatorial regions.
"
What is the connection between the observed anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background and the sub-eV neutrino masses?,"  We present a simplest inflationary scenario in the minimal left-right
symmetric model with spontaneous D-parity breaking, which is a well motivated
particle physics model for neutrino masses. This leads us to connect the
observed anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background to the sub-eV neutrino
masses. The baryon asymmetry via the leptogenesis route is also discussed
briefly.
"
What is the nature of the electronic conductivity in magnetite?,"  Magnetite (Fe$_{3}$O$_{4}$) is a mixed valent system where electronic
conductivity occurs on the B-site (octahedral) iron sublattice of the spinel
structure. Below $T_{V}=122$ K, a metal-insulator transition occurs which is
argued to arise from the charge ordering of 2+ and 3+ iron valences on the
B-sites (Verwey transition). Inelastic neutron scattering measurements show
that optical spin waves propagating on the B-site sublattice ($\sim$80 meV) are
shifted upwards in energy above $T_{V}$ due to the occurrence of B-B
ferromagnetic double exchange in the mixed valent metallic phase. The double
exchange interaction affects only spin waves of $\Delta_{5}$ symmetry, not all
modes, indicating that valence fluctuations are slow and the double exchange is
constrained by electron correlations above $T_{V}$.
"
What is the origin of a domain wall bubble in the context of a black hole?,"  We consider a model with a toroidally compactified extra dimension giving
rise to a temperature-dependent 4d effective potential with one-loop
contributions due to the Casimir effect, along with a 5d cosmological constant.
The forms of the effective potential at low and high temperatures indicates a
possibility for the formation of a domain wall bubble, formed by the modulus
scalar field, surrounding an evaporating black hole. This is viewed as an
example of a recently proposed black hole vacuum bubble arising from
matter-sourced moduli fields in the vicinity of an evaporating black hole [D.
Green, E. Silverstein, and D. Starr, Phys. Rev. D74, 024004 (2006),
arXiv:hep-th/0605047]. The black hole bubble can be highly opaque to lower
energy particles and photons, and thereby entrap them within. For high
temperature black holes, there may also be a symmetry-breaking black hole
bubble of false vacuum of the type previously conjectured by Moss [I.G. Moss,
Phys. Rev. D32,1333 (1985)], tending to reflect low energy particles from its
wall. A double bubble composed of these two different types of bubble may form
around the black hole, altering the hole's emission spectrum that reaches
outside observers. Smaller mass black holes that have already evaporated away
could have left vacuum bubbles behind that contribute to the dark matter.

"How do the observations constrain the radiation properties of the planet, such as its luminosity and beaming?","  All of the solar system gas giants produce electron cyclotron masers, driven
by the solar wind impinging on their magnetospheres. Extrapolating to the
planet orbiting tau Boo, various authors have predicted that it may be within
the detection limits of the 4-meter wavelength (74 MHz) system on the Very
Large Array. This paper reports three epochs of observations of tau Boo. In no
epoch do we detect the planet; various means of determining the upper limit to
the emission yield single-epoch limits ranging from 135 to 300 mJy. We develop
a likelihood method for multi-epoch observations and use it to constrain
various radiation properties of the planet. Assuming that the planet does
radiate at our observation wavelength, its typical luminosity must be less than
about 10^{16} W, unless its radiation is highly beamed into a solid angle Omega
<< 1 sr. While within the range of luminosities predicted by various authors
for this planet, this value is lower than recent estimates which attempt to
take into account the stellar wind of tau Boo using the known properties of the
star itself. Electron cyclotron maser emission from solar systems planets is
beamed, but with characteristic solid angles of approximately 1 sr illuminated.
Future long-wavelength instruments (e.g., the Long Wavelength Array and the Low
Frequency Array) must be able to make typical flux density measurements on
short time scales (~ 15 min.) of approximately 25 mJy in order to improve these
constraints significantly.
"
What is the relationship between the size of the alphabet and the additive error in algorithms for finding optimal codes?,"  There is a large literature devoted to the problem of finding an optimal
(min-cost) prefix-free code with an unequal letter-cost encoding alphabet of
size. While there is no known polynomial time algorithm for solving it
optimally there are many good heuristics that all provide additive errors to
optimal. The additive error in these algorithms usually depends linearly upon
the largest encoding letter size.
  This paper was motivated by the problem of finding optimal codes when the
encoding alphabet is infinite. Because the largest letter cost is infinite, the
previous analyses could give infinite error bounds. We provide a new algorithm
that works with infinite encoding alphabets. When restricted to the finite
alphabet case, our algorithm often provides better error bounds than the best
previous ones known.
"
What are the results for the density profiles in a harmonic trap?,"  A generalized Fermi-Bose mapping method is used to determine the exact ground
states of several models of mixtures of strongly interacting ultracold gases in
tight waveguides, which are generalizations of the Tonks-Girardeau (TG) gas (1D
Bose gas with point hard cores) and fermionic Tonks-Girardeau (FTG) gas (1D
spin-aligned Fermi gas with infinitely strong zero-range attractions). We
detail the case of a Bose-Fermi mixture with TG boson-boson (BB) and
boson-fermion (BF) interactions. Exact results are given for density profiles
in a harmonic trap, single-particle density matrices, momentum distributions,
and density-density correlations. Since the ground state is highly degenerate,
we analyze the splitting of the ground manifold for large but finite BB and BF
repulsions.
"
What is the effect of the antiferromagnetism on the oscillation period in the underdoped cuprates?,"  Magnetic field induced antiferromagnetic phase of the underdoped cuprates is
studied within the t-t'-J model. A magnetic field suppresses the pairing
amplitude, which in turn may induce antiferromagnetism. We apply our theory to
interpret the recently reported quantum oscillations in high magnetic field in
ortho-II YBa2Cu3O6.5 and propose that the total hole density abstracted from
the oscillation period is reduced by 50% due to the antiferromagnetism.
"
What is the critical value for interspecies attraction in a DBFM?,"  We investigate the mixing-demixing transition and the collapse in a
quasi-two-dimensional degenerate boson-fermion mixture (DBFM) with a bosonic
vortex. We solve numerically a quantum-hydrodynamic model based on a new
density functional which accurately takes into account the dimensional
crossover. It is demonstrated that with the increase of interspecies repulsion,
a mixed state of DBFM could turn into a demixed state. The system collapses for
interspecies attraction above a critical value which depends on the vortex
quantum number. For interspecies attraction just below this critical limit
there is almost complete mixing of boson and fermion components. Such mixed and
demixed states of a DBFM could be experimentally realized by varying an
external magnetic field near a boson-fermion Feshbach resonance, which will
result in a continuous variation of interspecies interaction.
"
What is the Calculating Valid Domains method for computing the solution space of valid configurations?,"  In these notes we formally describe the functionality of Calculating Valid
Domains from the BDD representing the solution space of valid configurations.
The formalization is largely based on the CLab configuration framework.
"
What are the properties of the supercluster in the ELAIS-N1 field?,"  We analyse the first publicly released deep field of the UKIDSS Deep
eXtragalactic Survey (DXS) to identify candidate galaxy over-densities at z~1
across ~1 sq. degree in the ELAIS-N1 field. Using I-K, J-K and K-3.6um colours
we identify and spectroscopically follow-up five candidate structures with
Gemini/GMOS and confirm they are all true over-densities with between five and
nineteen members each. Surprisingly, all five structures lie in a narrow
redshift range at z=0.89+/-0.01, although they are spread across 30Mpc on the
sky. We also find a more distant over-density at z=1.09 in one of the
spectroscopic survey regions. These five over-dense regions lying in a narrow
redshift range indicate the presence of a supercluster in this field and by
comparing with mock cluster catalogs from N-body simulations we discuss the
likely properties of this structure. Overall, we show that the properties of
this supercluster are similar to the well-studied Shapley and Hercules
superclusters at lower redshift.
"
How can the magnitude of the electromigration force be estimated using the statistical properties of step-edge fluctuations?,"  The temporal evolution of step-edge fluctuations under electromigration
conditions is analysed using a continuum Langevin model. If the
electromigration driving force acts in the step up/down direction, and
step-edge diffusion is the dominant mass-transport mechanism, we find that
significant deviations from the usual $t^{1/4}$ scaling of the terrace-width
correlation function occurs for a critical time $\tau$ which is dependent upon
the three energy scales in the problem: $k_{B}T$, the step stiffness, $\gamma$,
and the bias associated with adatom hopping under the influence of an
electromigration force, $\pm \Delta U$. For ($t < \tau$), the correlation
function evolves as a superposition of $t^{1/4}$ and $t^{3/4}$ power laws. For
$t \ge \tau$ a closed form expression can be derived. This behavior is
confirmed by a Monte-Carlo simulation using a discrete model of the step
dynamics. It is proposed that the magnitude of the electromigration force
acting upon an atom at a step-edge can by estimated by a careful analysis of
the statistical properties of step-edge fluctuations on the appropriate
time-scale.
"
"What is the concept of ""effective physical process"" in the context of quantum computing?","  The recent debate on hypercomputation has arisen new questions both on the
computational abilities of quantum systems and the Church-Turing Thesis role in
Physics. We propose here the idea of ""effective physical process"" as the
essentially physical notion of computation. By using the Bohm and Hiley active
information concept we analyze the differences between the standard form
(quantum gates) and the non-standard one (adiabatic and morphogenetic) of
Quantum Computing, and we point out how its Super-Turing potentialities derive
from an incomputable information source in accordance with Bell's constraints.
On condition that we give up the formal concept of ""universality"", the
possibility to realize quantum oracles is reachable. In this way computation is
led back to the logic of physical world.
"
What are the results of the calculations of the RIXS cross section in La2CuO4?,"  Recent experiments on La$_2$CuO$_4$ suggest that indirect resonant inelastic
X-ray scattering (RIXS) might provide a probe for transversal spin dynamics. We
present in detail a systematic expansion of the relevant magnetic RIXS cross
section by using the ultrashort core-hole lifetime (UCL) approximation. We
compute the scattering intensity and its momentum dependence in leading order
of the UCL expansion. The scattering is due to two-magnon processes and is
calculated within a linear spin-wave expansion of the Heisenberg spin model for
this compound, including longer range and cyclic spin interactions. We observe
that the latter terms in the Hamiltonian enhance the first moment of the
spectrum if they strengthen the antiferromagnetic ordering. The theoretical
spectra agree very well with experimental data, including the observation that
scattering intensity vanishes for the transferred momenta ${\bf q} = (0,0)$ and
${\bf q} = (\pi,\pi)$. We show that at finite temperature there is an
additional single-magnon contribution to the scattering with a spectral weight
proportional to $T^3$. We also compute the leading corrections to the UCL
approximation and find them to be small, putting the UCL results on a solid
basis. All this univocally points to the conclusion that the observed low
temperature RIXS intensity in La$_2$CuO$_4$ is due to two-magnon scattering.
"
What are the physical wavelengths of perturbations in the inflating region of a Robertson-Walker universe?,"  We observe that when a local patch in a radiation filled Robertson-Walker
universe inflates by some reason, outside perturbations can enter into the
inflating region. Generally, the physical wavelengths of these perturbations
become larger than the Hubble radius as they cross into the inflating space and
their amplitudes freeze out immediately. It turns out that the corresponding
power spectrum is not scale invariant. Although these perturbations cannot
reach out to a distance inner observer shielded by a de Sitter horizon, they
still indicate a curious boundary effect in local inflationary scenarios.
"
What are the aspects of manipulators in the direct and inverse kinematic models?,"  This article provides a formalism making it possible to manage the solutions
of the direct and inverse kinematic models of the fully parallel manipulators.
We introduce the concept of working modes to separate the solutions from the
opposite geometrical model. Then, we define, for each working mode, the aspects
of these manipulators. To separate the solutions from the direct kinematics
model, we introduce the concept of characteristic surfaces. Then, we define the
uniqueness domains, as being the greatest domains of the workspace in which
there is unicity of solutions. The principal applications of this work are the
design, the trajectory planning.
"
How can the algorithm handle a priori biological knowledge to improve its performance?,"  The important task of determining the connectivity of gene networks, and at a
more detailed level even the kind of interaction existing between genes, can
nowadays be tackled by microarraylike technologies. Yet, there is still a large
amount of unknowns with respect to the amount of data provided by a single
microarray experiment, and therefore reliable gene network retrieval procedures
must integrate all of the available biological knowledge, even if coming from
different sources and of different nature. In this paper we present a reverse
engineering algorithm able to reveal the underlying gene network by using
time-series dataset on gene expressions considering the system response to
different perturbations. The approach is able to determine the sparsity of the
gene network, and to take into account possible {\it a priori} biological
knowledge on it. The validity of the reverse engineering approach is
highlighted through the deduction of the topology of several {\it simulated}
gene networks, where we also discuss how the performance of the algorithm
improves enlarging the amount of data or if any a priori knowledge is
considered. We also apply the algorithm to experimental data on a nine gene
network in {\it Escherichia coli
"
What is the role of symbolic models in mitigating complexity in control design?,"  Symbolic models are abstract descriptions of continuous systems in which
symbols represent aggregates of continuous states. In the last few years there
has been a growing interest in the use of symbolic models as a tool for
mitigating complexity in control design. In fact, symbolic models enable the
use of well known algorithms in the context of supervisory control and
algorithmic game theory, for controller synthesis. Since the 1990's many
researchers faced the problem of identifying classes of dynamical and control
systems that admit symbolic models. In this paper we make a further progress
along this research line by focusing on control systems affected by
disturbances. Our main contribution is to show that incrementally globally
asymptotically stable nonlinear control systems with disturbances admit
symbolic models. When specializing these results to linear systems, we show
that these symbolic models can be easily constructed.
"
"What are the possible spectral signatures of hydrogen, especially the feature around 6200 Angstrom?","  We present spectral fits to five epochs of the typical Type Ib supernova
1999dn using the generalized, non-LTE, stellar atmospheres code PHOENIX. Our
goal is threefold: to determine basic physical properties of the supernova
ejecta, such as velocity, temperature, and density gradients; to reproduce He I
absorption lines by invoking non-thermal excitation; and, to investigate
possible spectral signatures of hydrogen, especially a feature around 6200
Angstrom, which has been attributed to high velocity $H_\alpha$. Our models
assume an atmosphere with uniform composition devoid of any hydrogen. Our model
spectra fit the observed spectra well, successfully reproducing most of the
features, including the prominent He I absorptions. The most plausible
alternative to $H_\alpha$ as the source of the 6200 Angstrom feature is a blend
of Fe II and Si II lines, which can be made stronger to fit the observed
feature better by increasing the metallicity of the ejecta. High-metallicity
models fit well at early epochs, but not as well as solar-metallicity models
after maximum light. While this blend of metal lines is a reasonable
explanation of the source of the 6200 Angstrom feature, it is still important
to investigate hydrogen as the source; therefore, a second paper will present
models that include a thin shell of hydrogen around the main composition
structure.
"
What is the key factor that affects the evolution of the ionization state of the Intergalactic Medium (IGM) around high-redshift quasars?,"  Absorption spectra of high redshift quasars exhibit an increasingly thick
Ly-alpha forest towards z~6. However, the interpretation of these spectra is
complicated by the fact that the Ly-alpha optical depth is already large for
neutral hydrogen fractions in excess of 10^-4, and also because quasars are
expected to reside in dense regions of the IGM. We present a model for the
evolution of the ionization state of the IGM which is applicable to the dense,
biased regions around high-redshift quasars as well as more typical regions in
the IGM, and combine this with numerical radiative transfer simulations. Our
model is able to simultaneously reproduce the observed Ly-alpha forest opacity
at 4<z<6, the ionizing photon mean-free-path at z~4 and the rapid evolution of
highly ionized near-zone sizes around high-redshift quasars at 5.8<z<6.4. We
find that within 5 physical Mpc of a high redshift quasar, the evolution of the
ionization state of the IGM precedes that in more typical regions by around 0.3
redshift units. More importantly, when combined with the rapid increase in the
ionizing photon mean-free-path expected shortly after overlap, this offset
results in an ionizing background near the quasar which exceeds the value in
the rest of the IGM by a factor of ~2-3. We further find that in the
post-overlap phase of reionization the size of the observed quasar near-zones
is not directly sensitive to the neutral hydrogen fraction of the IGM. Instead,
these sizes probe the level of the background ionization rate and the
temperature of the surrounding IGM. The observed rapid evolution of the quasar
near-zone sizes at 5.8<z<6.4 can thus be explained by the rapid evolution of
the ionizing background, which in our model is caused by the completion of
overlap at the end of reionization by 6<z<7.

What is the classical occupancy scheme with a refining sequence of random probability measures?,"  In the classical occupancy scheme, one considers a fixed discrete probability
measure ${\bf p}=(p_i: {i\in{\cal I}})$ and throws balls independently at
random in boxes labeled by ${\cal I}$, such that $p_i$ is the probability that
a given ball falls into the box $i$. In this work, we are interested in
asymptotic regimes of this scheme in the situation induced by a refining
sequence $({\bf p}(k) : k\in\N)$ of random probability measures which arise
from some multiplicative cascade. Our motivation comes from the study of the
asymptotic behavior of certain fragmentation chains
"
What is the Cowling resistivity and its effect on the emergence of a magnetic flux tube into the Solar corona?,"  For a magnetic flux tube, or indeed any flux, to emerge into the Solar corona
from the convection zone it must pass through the partially ionised layers of
the lower atmosphere: the photosphere and the chromosphere. In such regions the
ion-neutral collisions lead to an increased resistivity for currents flowing
across magnetic field lines. This Cowling resistivity can exceed the Spitzer
resistivity by orders of magnitude and in 2.5D simulations has been shown to be
sufficient to remove all cross field current from emerging flux. Here we extend
this modelling into 3D. Once again it is found that the Cowling resistivity
removes perpendicular current. However the presence of 3D structure prevents
the simple comparison possible in 2.5D simulations. With a fully ionised
atmosphere the flux emergence leads to an unphysically low temperature region
in the overlying corona, lifting of chromospheric material and the subsequent
onset of the Rayleigh-Taylor instability. Including neutrals removes the low
temperature region, lifts less chromospheric matter and shows no signs of the
Rayleigh-Taylor instability. Simulations of flux emergence therefore should
include such a neutral layer in order to obtain the correct perpendicular
current, remove the Rayleigh-Taylor instability and get the correct temperature
profile. In situations when the temperature is not important, i.e. when no
simulated spectral emission is required, a simple model for the neutral layer
is demonstrated to adequately reproduce the results of fully consistent
simulations.
"
What is the structure of BV-algebra on the singular homology of a 1-connected closed manifold?,"  Let $M$ be a 1-connected closed manifold and $LM$ be the space of free loops
on $M$. In \cite{C-S} M. Chas and D. Sullivan defined a structure of BV-algebra
on the singular homology of $LM$, $H_\ast(LM; \bk)$. When the field of
coefficients is of characteristic zero, we prove that there exists a BV-algebra
structure on $\hH^\ast(C^\ast (M); C^\ast (M))$ which carries the canonical
structure of Gerstenhaber algebra. We construct then an isomorphism of
BV-algebras between $\hH^\ast (C^\ast (M); C^\ast (M)) $ and the shifted $
H_{\ast+m} (LM; {\bk})$. We also prove that the Chas-Sullivan product and the
BV-operator behave well with the Hodge decomposition of $H_\ast (LM) $.
"
What is the Hartree-Fock method used to study an interacting one-dimensional electron system?,"  We use the Hartree-Fock method to study an interacting one-dimensional
electron system on a finite wire, partially depleted at the center by a smooth
potential barrier. A uniform one-Tesla Zeeman field is applied throughout the
system. We find that with the increase in the potential barrier, the low
density electrons under it go from a non-magnetic state to an antiferromagnetic
state, and then to a state with a well-localized spin-aligned region isolated
by two antiferromagnetic regions from the high density leads. At this final
stage, in response to a continuously increasing barrier potential, the system
undergoes a series of abrupt density changes, corresponding to the successive
expulsion of a single electron from the spin-aligned region under the barrier.
Motivated by the recent momentum-resolved tunneling experiments in a parallel
wire geometry, we also compute the momentum resolved tunneling matrix elements.
Our calculations suggest that the eigenstates being expelled are spatially
localized, consistent with the experimental observations. However, additional
mechanisms are needed to account for the experimentally observed large spectral
weight at near $k=0$ in the tunneling matrix elements.

"What are the generalizations of the case of a vector with independent, identically distributed components?","  In this paper, explicit error bounds are derived in the approximation of rank
$k$ projections of certain $n$-dimensional random vectors by standard
$k$-dimensional Gaussian random vectors. The bounds are given in terms of $k$,
$n$, and a basis of the $k$-dimensional space onto which we project. The random
vectors considered are two generalizations of the case of a vector with
independent, identically distributed components. In the first case, the random
vector has components which are independent but need not have the same
distribution. The second case deals with finite exchangeable sequences of
random variables.
"
What is the effective Lagrangian model used to describe the short-distance behavior of the Dirac sea?,"  We study pion propagation in asymmetric nuclear matter (ANM). One of the
interesting consequences of pion propagation in ANM is the mode splitting for
the different charged states of pions. First we describe the pion-nucleon
dynamics using the non-chiral model where one starts with pseudoscalar (PS)
$\pi$N coupling and the pseudovector (PV) representation is obtained via
suitable non-linear field transformations. For both of these cases the effect
of the Dirac sea is estimated. Subsequently, we present results using the
chiral effective Lagrangian where the short-distance behavior (Dirac vacuum) is
included by re-defining the field parameters as done in the modern effective
field theory approach developed recently. The results are compared with the
previous calculations for the case of symmetric nuclear matter (SNM). Closed
form analytical results are presented for the effective pion masses and
dispersion relations by making hard nucleon loop (HNL) approximation and
suitable density expansion.
"
What are the changes observed in the outer thermal X-ray lobe-jets and radio jets in the symbiotic star R Aqr over a four year interval?,"  Chandra and VLA observations of the symbiotic star R Aqr in 2004 reveal
significant changes over the three to four year interval between these
observations and previous observations taken with the VLA in 1999 and with
Chandra in 2000. This paper reports on the evolution of the outer thermal X-ray
lobe-jets and radio jets. The emission from the outer X-ray lobe-jets lies
farther away from the central binary than the outer radio jets, and comes from
material interpreted as being shock heated to ~10^6 K, a likely result of
collision between high speed material ejected from the central binary and
regions of enhanced gas density. Between 2000 and 2004, the Northeast (NE)
outer X-ray lobe-jet moved out away from the central binary, with an apparent
projected motion of ~580 km s^-1. The Southwest (SW) outer X-ray lobe-jet
almost disappeared between 2000 and 2004, presumably due to adiabatic expansion
and cooling. The NE radio bright spot also moved away from the central binary
between 2000 and 2004, but with a smaller apparent velocity than of the NE
X-ray bright spot. The SW outer lobe-jet was not detected in the radio in
either 1999 or 2004. The density and mass of the X-ray emitting material is
estimated. Cooling times, shock speeds, pressure and confinement are discussed.
"
What are the conditions under which a function on GL(n) is G-invariant?,"  In the paper, it is proved that any $C^{1}$-function on GL(n) which is
locally $P$-invariant (here $P$ is the affine (sub)group of GL(n)) is locally
$G$-invairant. There is also a statement for distributions (a very weak form of
Baruch's results).
"
What are the decay rates of the spin-triplet bottomonium states chi_{bJ} in hadronic decays?,"  We calculate the inclusive decay rate of the spin-triplet bottomonium states
chi_{bJ} into charm hadrons, including the leading-order color-singlet and
color-octet bb-bar annihilation mechanisms. We also calculate the momentum
distribution of the charm quark from the decay of chi_{bJ}. The infrared
divergences from the color-singlet process bb-bar -> cc-bar g are factored into
the probability density at the origin for a bb-bar pair in a color-octet state.
That probability density can be determined phenomenologically from the fraction
of decays of chi_{bJ} that include charm hadrons. It can then be used to
predict the partial widths into light hadrons for all four states in the P-wave
bottomonium multiplet.
"
What are the radial and non-radial oscillations of the Delta Scuti stars 7 Aql and 8 Aql?,"  We present an analysis of the pulsation behaviour of the Delta Scuti stars 7
Aql (HD 174532) and 8 Aql (HD 174589) -- a new variable star -- observed in the
framework of STEPHI XII campaign during 2003 June--July. 183 hours of high
precision photometry were acquired by using four-channel photometers at three
sites on three continents during 21 days. The light curves and amplitude
spectra were obtained following a classical scheme of multi-channel photometry.
Observations in different filters were also obtained and analyzed. Six and
three frequencies have been unambiguously detected above a 99% confidence level
in the range 0.090 mHz--0.300 mHz and 0.100 mHz-- 0.145 mHz in 7 Aql and 8 Aql
respectively. A comparison of observed and theoretical frequencies shows that 7
Aql and 8 Aql may oscillate with p modes of low radial orders, typical among
Delta Scuti stars. In terms of radial oscillations the range of 8 Aql goes from
n=1 to n=3 while for 7 Aql the range spans from n=4 to n=7. Non-radial
oscillations have to be present in both stars as well. The expected range of
excited modes according to a non adiabatic analysis goes from n=1 to n=6 in
both stars.

What is the relationship between the relativistic effects and the decay of correlation for a stationary stochastic process?,"  Starting with basic axioms of quantum theory I revisit ""Relative State
Interpretation'' set out 50 years ago by Hugh Everett.
"
What is the relationship between the strength of synapses and the storage capacity of the network?,"  We complement our previous work [arxiv: 0707.0565] with the full (non
diluted) solution describing the stable states of an attractor network that
stores correlated patterns of activity. The new solution provides a good fit of
simulations of a network storing the feature norms of McRae and colleagues
[McRae et al, 2005], experimentally obtained combinations of features
representing concepts in semantic memory. We discuss three ways to improve the
storage capacity of the network: adding uninformative neurons, removing
informative neurons and introducing popularity-modulated hebbian learning. We
show that if the strength of synapses is modulated by an exponential decay of
the popularity of the pre-synaptic neuron, any distribution of patterns can be
stored and retrieved with approximately an optimal storage capacity - i.e, C ~
I.p, the minimum number of connections per neuron needed to sustain the
retrieval of a pattern is proportional to the information content of the
pattern multiplied by the number of patterns stored in the network.
"
What is the cosmological constant in the context of the Hartle-Hawking boundary conditions?,"  In the last years the traditional scenario of Big Bang has been deeply
modified by the study of the quantum features of the Universe evolution,
proposing again the problem of using local physical laws on cosmic scale, with
particular regard to the cosmological constant role. The group extention method
shows that the De Sitter group univocally generalizes the Poincare group,
formally justifies the cosmological constant use and suggests a new
interpretation for Hartle-Hawking boundary conditions in Quantum Cosmology.
"
What is the new predominant nonlocal viscous term in the bottom kinematic boundary condition?,"  It is shown how to model weakly dissipative free-surface flows using the
classical potential flow approach. The Helmholtz-Leray decomposition is applied
to the linearized 3D Navier-Stokes equations. The governing equations are
treated using Fourier--Laplace transforms. We show how to express the vortical
component of the velocity only in terms of the potential and free-surface
elevation. A new predominant nonlocal viscous term is derived in the bottom
kinematic boundary condition. The resulting formulation is simple and does not
involve any correction procedure as in previous viscous potential flow theories
[Joseph2004]. Corresponding long wave model equations are derived.
"
What is the relationship between the Ising model and the socio-economic models?,"  I review three socio-economic models of economic opinions, urban segregation,
and language change and show that the well known two-dimensional Ising model
gives about the same results in each case.
"
What are the implications of the dependence of the concurrence and fidelity on the parameters of the spin-bath in the two cases N → ∞ and N = 40?,"  The dynamics of entanglement and fidelity for a subsystem of two separate
spin-1/2 qubits prepared in Bell states is investigated. One of the subsystem
qubit labelled $A$ is under the influence of a Heisenberg XY spin-bath, while
another one labelled $B$ is uncoupled with that. We discuss two cases: (i) the
number of bath spins $N\to\infty$; (ii) $N$ is finite: N=40. In both cases, the
bath is initially prepared in a thermal equilibrium state. It is shown that the
time dependence of the concurrence and the fidelity of the two subsystem qubits
can be controlled by tuning the parameters of the spin-bath, such as the
anisotropic parameter, the temperature and the coupling strength with qubit
$A$. It is interesting to find the dynamics of the concurrence is independent
of four different initial Bell states and that of the fidelity is divided into
two groups.
"
What is the relationship between relativistic Brownian motion and the second law of thermodynamics?,"  To reveal how nonequilibrium physics and relativity theory intertwine, this
articles studies relativistic Brownian motion under cosmic expansion. Two
fluctuation theorems for the entropy ds, which is locally produced in this
extreme nonequilibrium situation, are presented and proven. The first,
<exp(-ds)>=1, is a generalization of the second law of thermodynamics, that
remains valid at relativistic particle energies and under high cosmic expansion
rates. From this relation follows, that the probability to observe a local
reduction of entropy is exponentially small even if the universe was to
recollapse. For the special case of the Einstein-de Sitter universe an
additional relation, <exp(-ds-dh)>=1, is derived which holds simultaneously
with the first relation and where dh is proportional to the Hubble constant.
Furthermore, the fluctuation theorems are shown to provide a physical criterion
to resolve the known discretization dilemma arising in special-relativistic
Brownian motion. Explicit examples and a general method for the computation of
non-Gaussian entropy fluctuations are provided.
"
What are the global oracle inequalities for the selection rule?,"  In this paper we study the problem of adaptive estimation of a multivariate
function satisfying some structural assumption. We propose a novel estimation
procedure that adapts simultaneously to unknown structure and smoothness of the
underlying function. The problem of structural adaptation is stated as the
problem of selection from a given collection of estimators. We develop a
general selection rule and establish for it global oracle inequalities under
arbitrary $\rL_p$--losses. These results are applied for adaptive estimation in
the additive multi--index model.

"What are the errors in the argumentation of the paper ""On the Existence of Hadamard Matrices in J. Combinatorial Theory"" 21, 1976?","  In the paper On the Existence of Hadamard Matrices in J. Combinatorial Theory
21, 1976, it is shown that for a natural number q > 3, we can construct an
Hadamard Matrix of order 2^s q for s \geq t where t = [2 log_2(q-3)]. I will
show that this bound is not a consequence of the proof given in the paper and
explain the error in the argumentation.
"
What is the formula for the rate of pair production per unit area for massless fermions in a macroscopic electric field?,"  The Schwinger mechanism, the production of charged particle-antiparticle
pairs in a macroscopic external electric field, is derived for 2+1 dimensional
theories. The rate of pair production per unit area for four species of
massless fermions, with charge $q$, in a constant electric field $E$ is given
by $ \pi^{-2} \hbar^{-3/2} \tilde{c}^{-1/2} (q E)^{3/2} $ where $\tilde{c}$ is
the speed of light for the two-dimensional system. To the extent undoped
graphene behaves like the quantum field-theoretic vacuum for massless fermions
in 2+1 dimensions, the Schwinger mechanism should be testable experimentally. A
possible experimental configuration for this is proposed. Effects due to
deviations from this idealized picture of graphene are briefly considered. It
is argued that with present day samples of graphene, tests of the Schwinger
formula may be possible.
"
What is the relationship between the MIR dust emission and the AGN activities in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey?,"  Using a sample of the $Spitzer$ SWIRE-field galaxies whose optical spectra
are taken from the Data Release 4 of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, we study
possible correlations between the Mid-InfraRed (MIR) dust emission from these
galaxies and both their metallicities and AGN activities. We find that both
metallicity and AGN activity are well correlated with the following ratios:
PAH(Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon)-to-star, VSG(Very Small Grain)-to-star and
PAH-to-VSG, which can be characterized by $\nu L_{\nu}[8\mu m({\rm dust})]/\nu
L_{\nu}[3.6\mu m]$, $\nu L_{\nu}[24\mu m]/\nu L_{\nu}[3.6\mu m]$, and$\nu
L_{\nu}[8\mu m({\rm dust})]/\nu L_{\nu}[24\mu m]$ respectively. We argue that
our MIR-metallicity correlation could be explained by either the amount of dust
(ongoing dust formation) or dust destruction (PAHs and VSGs could be destroyed
by hard and intense radiation fields), and that the MIR-AGN correlation could
arise due to either PAH destruction or an enhanced VSG continuum by the central
AGN.
"
What are the implications of using a two-stage search for the detection of black holes?,"  Using recent results from numerical relativity simulations of non-spinning
binary black hole mergers we revisit the problem of detecting ringdown
waveforms and of estimating the source parameters, considering both LISA and
Earth-based interferometers. We find that Advanced LIGO and EGO could detect
intermediate-mass black holes of mass up to about 1000 solar masses out to a
luminosity distance of a few Gpc. For typical multipolar energy distributions,
we show that the single-mode ringdown templates presently used for ringdown
searches in the LIGO data stream can produce a significant event loss (> 10%
for all detectors in a large interval of black hole masses) and very large
parameter estimation errors on the black hole's mass and spin. We estimate that
more than 10^6 templates would be needed for a single-stage multi-mode search.
Therefore, we recommend a ""two stage"" search to save on computational costs:
single-mode templates can be used for detection, but multi-mode templates or
Prony methods should be used to estimate parameters once a detection has been
made. We update estimates of the critical signal-to-noise ratio required to
test the hypothesis that two or more modes are present in the signal and to
resolve their frequencies, showing that second-generation Earth-based detectors
and LISA have the potential to perform no-hair tests.
"
What is the relation between the dynamic dielectric constant and the perturbation of the superconducting phase in response to a high-frequency c-axis electric field?,"  We studied response of the Josephson vortex lattice in layered
superconductors to the high-frequency c-axis electric field. We found a simple
relation connecting the dynamic dielectric constant with the perturbation of
the superconducting phase, induced by oscillating electric field. Numerically
solving equations for the oscillating phases, we computed the frequency
dependences of the loss function at different magnetic fields, including
regions of both dilute and dense Josephson vortex lattices. The overall
behavior is mainly determined by the c-axis and in-plane dissipation
parameters, which is inversely proportional to the anisotropy. The cases of
weak and strong dissipation are realized in
$\mathrm{Bi_{2}Sr_{2}CaCu_{2}O_{x}}$ and underdoped $\mathrm{YBa_{2}Cu_{3}
O_{x}}$ correspondingly. The main feature of the response is the
Josephson-plasma-resonance peak. In the weak-dissipation case additional
satellites appear in the dilute regime mostly in the higher-frequency region
due to excitation of the plasma modes with the wave vectors set by the lattice
structure. In the dense-lattice limit the plasma peak moves to higher frequency
and its intensity rapidly decreases, in agreement with experiment and
analytical theory. Behavior of the loss function at low frequencies is well
described by the phenomenological theory of vortex oscillations. In the case of
very strong in-plane dissipation an additional peak in the loss function
appears below the plasma frequency. Such peak has been observed experimentally
in underdoped $\mathrm{YBa_{2}Cu_{3} O_{x}}$. It is caused by frequency
dependence of in-plane contribution to losses rather then a definite mode of
phase oscillations.
"
What are the requirements to write a good proposal for the ESO telescopes?,"  Preparing observing proposals is a classical exercise in an observational
astronomer's life. In this paper, we summarize the general requirements to
write a good proposal for the ESO telescopes, and eventually obtain telescope
time. We detail in particular the different proposal types, how they are
evaluated by ESO, what they should contain and what to avoid. The advice given
in the present paper are applicable to observing proposals for the AMBER and
MIDI instruments of the VLTI, but also to other ESO instruments, and to some
extent to other observatories.
"
What are the implications of the Standard Model background reduction on the radiative production of neutralinos?,"  We study the impact of beam polarization on radiative neutralino production
e+e- \to \chi^0_1 \chi^0_1 photon at the International Linear Collider. We show
that longitudinal polarized beams significantly enhance the signal and
simultaneously reduce the Standard Model background from radiative neutrino
production e+e- \to \nu \bar\nu photon. We point out that the radiative
production of neutralinos could be the only accessible SUSY particles, if
neutralinos, charginos, sleptons, as well as squarks and gluinos are too heavy
to be pair-produced in the first stage of the ILC at sqrt{s} = 500 GeV.
"
"What are the relationships to $(p,q)$-strings?","  We develop methods by which cosmic superstring interactions can be studied in
detail. These include the reconnection probability and emission of radiation
such as gravitons or small string loops. Loop corrections to these are
discussed, as well as relationships to $(p,q)$-strings. These tools should
allow a phenomenological study of string models in anticipation of upcoming
experiments sensitive to cosmic string radiation.
"
What is the dust-to-gas mass ratio of the LSB galaxies in the study?,"  Abridged: We present analysis of Spitzer Space Telescope observations of the
three low surface brightness (LSB) optical giant galaxies Malin 1, UGC 6614 and
UGC 9024. Mid- and far-infrared morphology, spectral energy distributions, and
integrated colors are used to derive the dust mass, dust-to-gas mass ratio,
total infrared luminosity, and star formation rate (SFR). The 8 micron images
indicate that polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon molecules are present in the
central regions of all three metal-poor LSB galaxies. The diffuse optical disks
of Malin 1 and UGC 9024 remain undetected at mid- and far-infrared wavelengths.
The dustiest of the three LSB galaxies, UGC 6614, has infrared morphology that
varies significantly with wavelength. The 8 and 24 micron emission is
co-spatial with H\alpha emission previously observed in the outer ring of UGC
6614. The estimated dust-to-gas ratios, from less than 10^{-3} to 10^{-2},
support previous indications that the LSB galaxies are relatively dust poor
compared to the HSB galaxies. The total infrared luminosities are approximately
1/3 to 1/2 the blue band luminosities, suggesting that old stellar populations
are the primary source of dust heating in these LSB objects. The SFR estimated
from the infrared data ranges ~0.01-0.88 M_sun yr^{-1}, consistent with results
from optical studies.
"
What are the factors influencing the location of the hump and dip structure in the plateau region of the harmonic spectrum?,"  In the present paper, we investigate the high-order harmonic generation (HHG)
from diatomic molecules with large internuclear distance using a strong field
approximation (SFA) model. We find that the hump and dip structure emerges in
the plateau region of the harmonic spectrum, and the location of this striking
structure is sensitive to the laser intensity. Our model analysis reveals that
two-center interference as well as the interference between different
recombination electron trajectories are responsible for the unusual enhanced or
suppressed harmonic yield at a certain order, and these interference effects
are greatly influenced by the laser parameters such as intensity.
"
What are the key components of the HHG spectra that can be extracted from the Lewenstein model?,"  We demonstrate a simple method to improve the Lewenstein model for the
description of high-order harmonic generation (HHG). It is shown that HHG
spectra can be expressed as the product of a returning electron wave packet and
the photo-recombination cross sections, where the former can be extracted from
the Lewenstein model. By replacing plane waves with scattering waves in the
calculation of recombination matrix elements, we showed that the resulting HHG
spectra agree well with those from solving the time-dependent Schr\""odinger
equation. The improved model can be used for quantitative calculations of high
harmonics generated by molecules.
"
What is the recursion relation for the Feynman diagrams of the CJT effective action?,"  We derive a new recursion relation to obtain the Feynman diagrams of the
Cornwall-Jackiw-Toumboulis(CJT) effective action by using the functional
derivative identities. By using this recursion relation we show the
two-particle-irreducibility of the Feynman diagrams of the CJT effective action
by induction. We apply the recursion relation to obtain the Feynman diagrams of
the CJT effective action up to the four-loop order in case of the bosonic field
theory.

What is the discontinuous effect of a light source moving through an observer at rest?,"  Extending physics/0701092, a light source of monochromatic radiation, in

What are the results of the analysis of the gamma^* p --> rho^0 p cross section and the distribution of the squared-four-momentum transfer to the proton at HERA?,"  Exclusive rho^0 electroproduction at HERA has been studied with the ZEUS
detector using 120 pb^{-1} of integrated luminosity collected during 1996-2000.
The analysis was carried out in the kinematic range of photon virtuality 2 <
Q^2 < 160 GeV$^2, and gamma^* p centre-of-mass energy 32 < W < 180 GeV. The
results include the Q^2 and W dependence of the gamma^* p --> rho^0 p cross
section and the distribution of the squared-four-momentum transfer to the
proton. The helicity analysis of the decay-matrix elements of the rho^0 was
used to study the ratio of the gamma^* p cross section for longitudinal and
transverse photon as a function of Q^2 and W. Finally, an effective Pomeron
trajectory was extracted. The results are compared to various theoretical
predictions.

What are the sufficient conditions for the boundedness of fractional integral operators on the modulation spaces?,"  In this paper, we give the necessary and sufficient conditions for the
boundedness of fractional integral operators on the modulation spaces.
"
What are the probabilistic properties of inverted and mirror repeats in model sequences of nucleic acids?,"  We analytically and numerically study the probabilistic properties of
inverted and mirror repeats in model sequences of nucleic acids. We consider
both perfect and non-perfect repeats, i.e. repeats with mismatches and gaps.
The considered sequence models are independent identically distributed (i.i.d.)
sequences, Markov processes and long range sequences. We show that the number
of repeats in correlated sequences is significantly larger than in i.i.d.
sequences and that this discrepancy increases exponentially with the repeat
length for long range sequences.
"
What is the relationship between general relativity and Modified Newtonian dynamics?,"  Bekenstein's alternative to general relativity, TeVeS, reduces to Modified
Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) in the galactic limit. On cosmological scales, the
(potential well <-> overdensity) relationship is quite different than in
standard general relativity. Here we investigate the possibility of
cross-correlating galaxies with the cosmic microwave background (CMB) to probe
this relationship. At redshifts of order 2, the sign of the CMB-galaxy
correlation differs in TeVeS from that in general relativity. We show that this
effect is detectable and hence can serve as a powerful discriminator of these
two models of gravity.
"
What is the wreath product of a group of order 2 with the derived subgroup of the group G?,"  Let $K$ be field of characteristic 2 and let $G$ be a finite non-abelian
2-group with the cyclic derived subgroup $G'$, and there exists a central
element $z$ of order 2 in $Z(G) \backslash G'$. We prove that the unit group of
the group algebra $KG$ possesses a section isomorphic to the wreath product of
a group of order 2 with the derived subgroup of the group $G$, giving for such
groups a positive answer to the question of A. Shalev.
"
What are the equations for the eigenfunction included in the defining boundary-value problem?,"  We propose new methods for the numerical continuation of point-to-cycle
connecting orbits in 3-dimensional autonomous ODE's using projection boundary
conditions. In our approach, the projection boundary conditions near the cycle
are formulated using an eigenfunction of the associated adjoint variational
equation, avoiding costly and numerically unstable computations of the
monodromy matrix. The equations for the eigenfunction are included in the
defining boundary-value problem, allowing a straightforward implementation in
AUTO, in which only the standard features of the software are employed.
Homotopy methods to find connecting orbits are discussed in general and
illustrated with several examples, including the Lorenz equations. Complete
AUTO demos, which can be easily adapted to any autonomous 3-dimensional ODE
system, are freely available.
"
How do the simulations of cosmic rays in the Galaxy help to assess the role of various effects in the complex problem of propagation?,"  We present the results of a numerical simulation of propagation of cosmic
rays with energy above $10^{15}$ eV in a complex magnetic field, made in
general of a large scale component and a turbulent component. Several
configurations are investigated that may represent specific aspects of a
realistic magnetic field of the Galaxy, though the main purpose of this
investigation is not to achieve a realistic description of the propagation in
the Galaxy, but rather to assess the role of several effects that define the
complex problem of propagation. Our simulations of Cosmic Rays in the Galaxy
will be presented in Paper II. We identified several effects that are difficult
to interpret in a purely diffusive approach and that play a crucial role in the
propagation of cosmic rays in the complex magnetic field of the Galaxy. We
discuss at length the problem of the extrapolation of our results to much lower
energies where data are available on the confinement time of cosmic rays in the
Galaxy. The confinement time and its dependence on particles' rigidity are
crucial ingredients for 1) relating the source spectrum to the observed cosmic
ray spectrum; 2) quantifying the production of light elements by spallation; 3)
predicting the anisotropy as a function of energy.

What is the equivariant derived category of the affine Grassmannian described in terms of coherent sheaves on the Langlands dual Lie algebra equivariant with respect to the adjoint action?,"  We explain (following V. Drinfeld) how the equivariant derived category of
the affine Grassmannian can be described in terms of coherent sheaves on the
Langlands dual Lie algebra equivariant with respect to the adjoint action, due
to some old results of V. Ginzburg. The global cohomology functor corresponds
under this identification to restricti on to the Kostant slice. We extend this
description to loop rotation equivariant derived category, linking it to
Harish-Chandra bimodules for the Langlands dual Lie algebra, so that the global
cohomology functor corresponds to the quantum Kostant-Whittaker reduction of a
Harish-Chandra bimodule. We derive a conjecture from math.AG/0306413 which
identifies the loop-rotation equivariant homology of the affine Grassmannian
with quantized completed Toda lattice.
"
What are the strange quark contributions to the neutrino scattering in the nucleon?,"  Strange quark contributions to the neutral current reaction in the neutrino
scattering are investigated on the nucleon level and extended to the $^{12}$C
target nucleus through the neutrino-induced knocked-out nucleon process in the
quasi-elastic region within the framework of a relativistic single particle
model. The incident energy range between 500 MeV and 1.0 GeV is used for the
neutrino(antineutrino) scattering. Effects of the final state interaction for
the knocked-out nucleon are included by a relativistic optical potential. We
found that the sensitivity of the strange quark contents could be salient on
the asymmetry between neutrino and antineutrino scattering cross sections. In
specific, $A (\nu ({\bar \nu}), \nu^{'} ({\bar \nu}^{'}) N)$ reaction is shown
to be very sensitive test in the searches of the strangeness.
"
What is the upper limit on the integrated gamma-ray flux of the BL Lac object 1ES2344+514?,"  We have observed the BL Lac object 1ES2344+514 (z = 0.044) in Very High
Energy (VHE) gamma-ray and near-infrared wavelength bands with TACTIC and MIRO
telescopes respectively. The observations were made from 18th October to 9th
December 2004 and 27th October 2005 to 1st January 2006. Detailed analysis of
the TACTIC data indicates absence of a statistically significant gamma-ray
signal both in overall data and on a nightly basis from the source direction.
We estimate an upper limit of I($\geq$1.5 TeV)$\leq 3.84 \times 10^{-12}$
photons cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ at a 3$\sigma$ confidence level on the integrated
$\gamma$-ray flux. In addition, we have also compared TACTIC TeV light curves
with those of the RXTE ASM (2-12keV) for the contemporary period and find that
there are no statistically significant increases in the signal strengths from
the source in both these energy regions. During 2004 IR observations,
1ES2344+514 shows low level (~0.06 magnitude) day-to-day variation in both, J &
H bands. However, during 2005 observation epoch, the source brightens up by
about 0.41 magnitude from its October 2005 level J magnitude= 12.64 to J =
12.23 on December 6, 2005. It then fades by about 0.2 magnitude during 6 to 10
December, 2005. The variation is seen in both, J & H, bands simultaneously. The
light travel time arguments suggest that the emission region size is of the
order of $10^{17}$ cms.
"
What is the importance of metal-free and metal cooling in the universe?,"  Cooling is the main process leading to the condensation of gas in the dark
matter potential wells and consequently to star and structure formation. In a
metal-free environment, the main available coolants are H, He, H$_2$ and HD;
once the gas is enriched with metals, these also become important in defining
the cooling properties of the gas. We discuss the implementation in Gadget-2 of
molecular and metal cooling at temperatures lower that $\rm10^4 K$, following
the time dependent properties of the gas and pollution from stellar evolution.
We have checked the validity of our scheme comparing the results of some test
runs with previous calculations of cosmic abundance evolution and structure
formation, finding excellent agreement. We have also investigated the relevance
of molecule and metal cooling in some specific cases, finding that inclusion of
HD cooling results in a higher clumping factor of the gas at high redshifts,
while metal cooling at low temperatures can have a significant impact on the
formation and evolution of cold objects.
"
What is the Lanczos algorithm used to solve the Dirac equation for a relativistic electron in an external Coulomb potential?,"  Covergent eigensolutions of the Dirac Equation for a relativistic electron in
an external Coulomb potential are obtained using the Lanczos Algorithm. A
tri-diagonal matrix representation of the Dirac Hamiltonian operator is
constructed iteratively and diagonalized after each iteration step to form a
sequence of convergent eigenvalue solutions. Any spurious solutions which arise
from the presence of continuum states can easily be identified.
"
What are the oscillatory magnetic field dependence of the oscillations in the arrays of semiconductor rings?,"  In a recent Letter, Bergsten and co-authors have studied the resistance
oscillations with gate voltage and magnetic field in arrays of semiconductor
rings and interpreted the oscillatory magnetic field dependence as
Altshuler-Aronov-Spivak (AAS) oscillations and oscillatory dependence on gate
voltage as the Aharonov-Casher (AC) effect. This Comment shows that Bergsten
and co-authors incorrectly identified AAS effect as a source of resistance
oscillations in magnetic field, that spin relaxation in their experimental
setting is strong enough to destroy oscillatory effects of spin origin, and
that the oscillations are caused by changes in carrier density and the Fermi
energy by gate, and are unrelated to spin.
"
What is the dependence of the ground-state energy on the number of polaritons?,"  In this work, we present a theoretical study of a quantum dot-microcavity
system which includes a constant magnetic field in the growth direction of the
micropillar. First, we study the zero temperature case by means of a
selfconsistent procedure with a trial function composed by a coherent photon
field and a BCS function for the electron-hole pairs. The dependence of the
ground-state energy on the magnetic field and the number of polaritons is
found. We show that the magnetic field can be used as a control parameter of
the photon number, and we make explicit the scaling of the total energy with
the number of polaritons. Next, we study this problem at finite temperatures
and obtain the scaling of the critical temperature with the number of
polaritons.
"
What is the significance of the GEM tracker for the STAR experiment at RHIC?,"  The planned tracking upgrade of the STAR experiment at RHIC includes a
large-area GEM tracker used to determine the charge sign of electrons and
positrons produced from W+(-) decays. For such a large-scale project commercial
availability of GEM foils is necessary. We report first results obtained with a
triple GEM detector using GEM foils produced by Tech-Etch Inc. of Plymouth, MA,
USA. Measurements of gain uniformity, long-term stability as well as
measurements of the energy resolution for X-Rays are compared to results
obtained with an identical detector using GEM foils produced at CERN. A quality
assurance procedure based on optical tests using an automated high-resolution
scanner has been established, allowing a study of the correlation of the
observed behavior of the detector and the geometrical properties of the GEM
foils. Detectors based on Tech-Etch and CERN produced foils both show good
uniformity of the gain over the active area and stable gain after an initial
charge-up period, making them well suited for precision tracking applications.
"
What is the nature of the cyclotron instability in the RX J1856.5-3754 pulsar?,"  A spectral analysis of the nearby isolated neutron star RX J1856.5-3754 is
presented. Applying the kinetic approach, the distribution functions of
emitting electrons are derived and the entire spectra is fitted. It is found
that waves excited by the cyclotron mechanism, come in the radio domain. We
confirm that the cyclotron instability is quite efficient, since the
estimations show that the time of wave-particle interaction is long enough for
particles to acquire perpendicular momentum and generate observed radiation.
The lack of rotational modulation is discussed and the pulsar spin period is
estimated.
"
What is the relationship between observable and ancillary qubits in measurement-based quantum computation?,"  We improve the upper bound on the minimal resources required for
measurement-based quantum computation. Minimizing the resources required for
this model is a key issue for experimental realization of a quantum computer
based on projective measurements. This new upper bound allows also to reply in
the negative to the open question about the existence of a trade-off between
observable and ancillary qubits in measurement-based quantum computation.
"
What is the relationship between dark matter temperature and direction in the universe?,"  The Universe contains approximately 6 times more dark matter than normal
baryonic matter, and a directly observed fundamental difference between dark
matter and baryons would both be significant for our understanding of dark
matter structures and provide us with information about the basic
characteristics of the dark matter particle. We discuss one distinctive feature
of dark matter structures in equilibrium, namely the property that a local dark
matter temperature may depend on direction. This is in stark contrast to
baryonic gases. We used X-ray observations of two nearby, relaxed galaxy
clusters, under the assumptions of hydrostatic equilibrium and identical dark
matter and gas temperatures in the outer cluster region, to measure this dark
matter temperature anisotropy beta_dm, with non-parametric Monte Carlo methods.
We find that beta_dm is greater than the value predicted for baryonic gases,
beta_gas=0, at more than 3 sigma confidence. The observed value of the
temperature anisotropy is in fair agreement with the results of cosmological
N-body simulations and shows that the equilibration of the dark matter
particles is not governed by local point-like interactions in contrast to
baryonic gases.
"
What are the implications of the photon momentum-energy vector in dielectrics?,"  The definition of the photon in the vacuum of general relativity provided by
Kermack et al. and by Synge is extended to nondispersive, nonhomogeneous,
isotropic dielectrics in arbitrary motion by Hamiltonian methods that rely on
Gordon's effective metric. By these methods the old dilemma, whether the
momentum-energy vector of the photon in dielectrics is timelike or spacelike in
character, is shown to reappear under a novel guise.
"
What is the theory of spinal decompositions of discrete and continuous fragmentation trees?,"  We develop some theory of spinal decompositions of discrete and continuous
fragmentation trees. Specifically, we consider a coarse and a fine spinal
integer partition derived from spinal tree decompositions. We prove that for a
two-parameter Poisson--Dirichlet family of continuous fragmentation trees,
including the stable trees of Duquesne and Le Gall, the fine partition is
obtained from the coarse one by shattering each of its parts independently,
according to the same law. As a second application of spinal decompositions, we
prove that among the continuous fragmentation trees, stable trees are the only
ones whose distribution is invariant under uniform re-rooting.
"
How is the quantum algorithm used to estimate parameters at the quantum metrology limit?,"  We present a quantum algorithm to estimate parameters at the quantum
metrology limit using deterministic quantum computation with one bit. When the
interactions occurring in a quantum system are described by a Hamiltonian $H=
\theta H_0$, we estimate $\theta$ by zooming in on previous estimations and by
implementing an adaptive Bayesian procedure. The final result of the algorithm
is an updated estimation of $\theta$ whose variance has been decreased in
proportion to the time of evolution under H. For the problem of estimating
several parameters, we implement dynamical-decoupling techniques and use the
results of single parameter estimation. The cases of discrete-time evolution
and reference-frame alignment are also discussed within the adaptive approach.
"
What are the prospects of measuring the cross section for inclusive b production in events containing jets and at least one muons are presented?,"  The LHC provides new opportunities to improve our understanding of the b
quark using high statistics data samples and the 14 TeV center-of-mass energy.
The prospects to measure the cross section for inclusive b production in events
containing jets and at least one muon are presented. Studies of detector
systematic effects and theoretical uncertainties are included. QCD aspects of
the beauty production are discussed.
"
What is the relationship between the mean time a polymer takes to leave a pore and the force applied to one end?,"  We study the passage times of a translocating polymer of length $N$ in three
dimensions, while it is pulled through a narrow pore with a constant force $F$
applied to one end of the polymer. At small to moderate forces, satisfying the
condition $FN^{\nu}/k_BT\lesssim1$, where $\nu\approx0.588$ is the Flory
exponent for the polymer, we find that $\tau_N$, the mean time the polymer
takes to leave the pore, scales as $N^{2+\nu}$ independent of $F$, in agreement
with our earlier result for F=0. At strong forces, i.e., for
$FN^{\nu}/k_BT\gg1$, the behaviour of the passage time crosses over to
$\tau_N\sim N^2/F$. We show here that these behaviours stem from the polymer
dynamics at the immediate vicinity of the pore -- in particular, the memory
effects in the polymer chain tension imbalance across the pore.
"
What is the DAMA observatory used for observing rare processes?,"  DAMA is an observatory for rare processes and it is operative deep
underground at the Gran Sasso National Laboratory of the I.N.F.N. (LNGS). Here
some arguments will be presented on the investigation on dark matter particles
by annual modulation signature and on some of the realized double beta decay
searches.
"
What is the observed phenomenon of repulsion between spikes in chaotic semiconductor lasers?,"  We analyze the time resolved spike statistics of a solitary and two mutually
interacting chaotic semiconductor lasers whose chaos is characterized by
apparently random, short intensity spikes. Repulsion between two successive
spikes is observed, resulting in a refractory period which is largest at laser
threshold. For time intervals between spikes greater than the refractory
period, the distribution of the intervals follows a Poisson distribution. The
spiking pattern is highly periodic over time windows corresponding to the
optical length of the external cavity, with a slow change of the spiking
pattern as time increases. When zero-lag synchronization between the two lasers
is established, the statistics of the nearly perfectly matched spikes are not
altered. The similarity of these features to those found in complex interacting
neural networks, suggests the use of laser systems as simpler physical models
for neural networks.
"
What are the initial state of quantum dots that can be obtained and the voltage pulses that should be applied to achieve a desired final product?,"  We propose using semiconductor quantum dots for a simulation of chemical
reactions as electrons are redistributed among such artificial atoms. We show
that it is possible to achieve various reaction regimes and obtain different
reaction products by varying the speed of voltage changes applied to the gates
forming quantum dots. Considering the simplest possible reaction, $H_2+H\to
H+H_2$, we show how the necessary initial state can be obtained and what
voltage pulses should be applied to achieve a desirable final product. Our
calculations have been performed using the Pechukas gas approach, which can be
extended for more complicated reactions.
"
What are the stages in the lifetime of a cosmic ray particle?,"  The detection of high-energy particles, cosmic rays (CRs), deep inside the
heliosphere implies that there are, at least, three distinctly different stages
in the lifetime of a CR particle: acceleration, propagation in the interstellar
medium (ISM), and propagation in the heliosphere. Gamma rays produced by
interactions of CRs with gas, radiation, and magnetic fields can be used to
study their spectra in different locations. Still, accurate direct measurements
of CR species inside the heliosphere (such as their spectra and abundances) are
extremely important for the understanding of their origin and propagation. In
this paper, an emphasis is made on very recent advances and especially on those
where GLAST and PAMELA observations can lead to further progress in our
understanding of CRs.
"
What are the factors that drive the increase in the resistance noise in the underdoped regime?,"  The resistance noise in a Bi_2Sr_2CaCu_2O$_{8+\delta}$ thin film is found to
increase strongly in the underdoped regime. While the increase of the raw
resistance noise with decreasing temperature appears to roughly track the
previously reported pseudogap temperature for this material, standard noise
analysis rather suggests that the additional noise contribution is driven by
the proximity of the superconductor-insulator transition.
"
What is the toric version of the Abel-inverse theorem?,"  We extend the usual projective Abel-Radon transform to the larger context of
a smooth complete toric variety X. We define and study toric concavity attached
to an algebraic splitting vector bundle on X and we prove a toric version of
the Abel-inverse theorem.
"
What are the parameters of the Zakharov model used to simulate Langmuir turbulence in the Earth's ionosphere?,"  We have performed a simulation study of Langmuir turbulence in the Earth's
ionosphere by means of a Zakharov model with parameters relevant for the F
layer. The model includes dissipative terms to model collisions and Landau
damping of the electrons and ions, and a linear density profile, which models
the ionospheric plasma inhomogeneity whose length scale is of the order 10--100
km. The injection of energy into the system is modeled by a constant source
term in the Zakharov equation. Langmuir turbulence is excited ``on-demand'' in
controlled ionospheric modification experiments where the energy is provided by
an HF radio beam injected into the overhead ionospheric plasma. The ensuing
turbulence can be studied with radars and in the form of secondary radiation
recorded by ground-based receivers. We have analyzed spectral signatures of the
turbulence for different sets of parameters and different altitudes relative to
the turning point of the linear Langmuir mode where the Langmuir frequency
equals the local plasma frequency. By a parametric analysis, we have derived a
simple scaling law, which links the spectral width of the turbulent frequency
spectrum to the physical parameters in the ionosphere. The scaling law provides
a quantitative relation between the physical parameters (temperatures, electron
number density, ionospheric length scale, etc.) and the observed frequency
spectrum. This law may be useful for interpreting experimental results.
"
What are the results of the analysis of the microscopic irregular dynamics in finite networks of arbitrary connectivity?,"  For infinitely large sparse networks of spiking neurons mean field theory
shows that a balanced state of highly irregular activity arises under various
conditions. Here we analytically investigate the microscopic irregular dynamics
in finite networks of arbitrary connectivity, keeping track of all individual
spike times. For delayed, purely inhibitory interactions we demonstrate that
the irregular dynamics is not chaotic but rather stable and convergent towards
periodic orbits. Moreover, every generic periodic orbit of these dynamical
systems is stable. These results highlight that chaotic and stable dynamics are
equally capable of generating irregular activity.
"
What are the critical energies for the continuous Dirac case with positive mass?,"  Quantum dynamical lower bounds for continuous and discrete one-dimensional
Dirac operators are established in terms of transfer matrices. Then such
results are applied to various models, including the Bernoulli-Dirac one and,
in contrast to the discrete case, critical energies are also found for the
continuous Dirac case with positive mass.
"
What is the phase diagram of a pseudo-ternary compound CoMnGe_{1-x}Sn_{x}?,"  We propose the phase diagram of a new pseudo-ternary compound,
CoMnGe_{1-x}Sn_{x}, in the range x less than or equal to 0.1. Our phase diagram
is a result of magnetic and calometric measurements. We demonstrate the
appearance of a hysteretic magnetostructural phase transition in the range
x=0.04 to x=0.055, similar to that observed in CoMnGe under hydrostatic
pressure. From magnetisation measurements, we show that the isothermal entropy
change associated with the magnetostructural transition can be as high as 4.5
J/(K kg) in a field of 1 Tesla. However, the large thermal hysteresis in this
transition (~20 K) will limit its straightforward use in a magnetocaloric
device.
"
What is the impact of increasing the number of cluster atoms on the accuracy of measurements of nearby qubits?,"  One of the fundamental conditions for one-way quantum computation (1WQC) is
the ability to make sequential measurements on isolated qubits that comprise
the highly entangled resource for 1WQC, the cluster state. This has been a
significant impediment in the implementation of 1WQC with ultracold atoms
confined in optical lattices, because the width of the measuring lasers is
generally much greater than the atomic (qubit) spacing. We demonstrate that
deterministic 1WQC is nevertheless possible, with a polynomial increase in the
number of operations, as long as the center of the beams can be positioned with
high accuracy. Extending the number of cluster atoms, the scheme is also able
to compensate for accidental measurements of an arbitrary number of nearby
qubits.
"
What is the configuration space method used for computing propagators of a scalar field in Minkowski and Anti de Sitter spacetime?,"  In this master thesis a configuration space method presented by C. Dullemond
and E. van Beveren for computing all propagators of a scalar field (Wightman,
Hadamard and Schwinger functions,retarded, advanced and Feynman propagator) is
reviewed for four-dimensional Minkowski and Anti de Sitter spacetime AdS_4.
This method is then applied for AdS_d as well as de Sitter spacetime dS_d of
arbitrary dimension d, obtaining results in agreement with the literature. The
advantages of the method are that it needs neither mode summation nor analytic
continuation from euclidean time, while delivering the propagators above
including (i-epsilon)-prescription, plus as a nice bonus the conformal
dimension of a corresponding CFT field. General properties of the considered
spacetimes (namely various coordinate systems and their metrics, chordal
distances, relations between conformal dimensions \Delta and the mass m of the
scalar field, geodesics and the invariance of time ordering) are also examined
and compiled from various sources, providing an overview of geometrical
properties of AdS and dS spacetimes.
"
What is the brane scenario with anti de Sitter bulk?,"  The usual brane world scenario with anti de Sitter bulk has been generalized
by considering a general form of energy momentum tensor in the bulk. The
modified Einstein equation on the brane has been constructed. Two examples have
been cited of which, the first one shows the usual brane equations when matter
in the bulk is a negative cosmological constant. In the second example, the
bulk matter is in the form of perfect fluid and as a result, an effective
perfect fluid is obtained in the brane. Also it is noted that the effect of the
dust bulk on the brane shows a dark energy behaviour and may be a possible
explanation of the dark energy from the present day observational point of
view.
"
What is the decentralized relay selection protocol based on opportunistic feedback in wireless networks?,"  It has been shown that a decentralized relay selection protocol based on
opportunistic feedback from the relays yields good throughput performance in
dense wireless networks. This selection strategy supports a hybrid-ARQ
transmission approach where relays forward parity information to the
destination in the event of a decoding error. Such an approach, however,
suffers a loss compared to centralized strategies that select relays with the
best channel gain to the destination. This paper closes the performance gap by
adding another level of channel feedback to the decentralized relay selection
problem. It is demonstrated that only one additional bit of feedback is
necessary for good throughput performance. The performance impact of varying
key parameters such as the number of relays and the channel feedback threshold
is discussed. An accompanying bit error rate analysis demonstrates the
importance of relay selection.
"
What is the formula used to express the expectation value of a quantum system?,"  Given a physical quantum system described by a Hilbert H, for any bounded
quantum observable (a bounded self-adjoint operator) T it is possible to define
several ''hidden observable'' functions f:H->R associated to T and for any
quantum mixed state (a density matrix) D it is possible to define several
''hidden mixed states'' (probability measures) m on H associated to D in such a
way that the following equality is verified:
  Trace[ b(T). D] =integral[b(f(psi)).dm(psi) whatever is the continuous
function b:R->R. This formula gives a general way to express any expectation
value computable in a quantum theory as a classical statistical mean value.
"
What are the microscopic origins of heavy-tailed probability density distributions for the price variation of financial instruments?,"  In this paper we study the possible microscopic origin of heavy-tailed
probability density distributions for the price variation of financial
instruments. We extend the standard log-normal process to include another
random component in the so-called stochastic volatility models. We study these
models under an assumption, akin to the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, in
which the volatility has already relaxed to its equilibrium distribution and
acts as a background to the evolution of the price process. In this
approximation, we show that all models of stochastic volatility should exhibit
a scaling relation in the time lag of zero-drift modified log-returns. We
verify that the Dow-Jones Industrial Average index indeed follows this scaling.
We then focus on two popular stochastic volatility models, the Heston and
Hull-White models. In particular, we show that in the Hull-White model the
resulting probability distribution of log-returns in this approximation
corresponds to the Tsallis (t-Student) distribution. The Tsallis parameters are
given in terms of the microscopic stochastic volatility model. Finally, we show
that the log-returns for 30 years Dow Jones index data is well fitted by a
Tsallis distribution, obtaining the relevant parameters.
"
What are the bounds for the eigenratio of the network structural matrix?,"  In this paper, subgraphs and complementary graphs are used to analyze the
network synchronizability. Some sharp and attainable bounds are provided for
the eigenratio of the network structural matrix, which characterizes the
network synchronizability, especially when the network's corresponding graph
has cycles, chains, bipartite graphs or product graphs as its subgraphs.
"
What is the gauge group in the supersymmetric standard model that corresponds to a left-right symmetric Pati-Salam model?,"  We show how gauge coupling unification near the Planck scale $M_P\sim
10^{19}$ GeV can be achieved in the framework of supersymmetry, facilitating a
full unification of all forces with gravity. Below the conventional GUT scale
$M_{GUT}\sim 10^{16}$ GeV physics is described by a Supersymmetric Standard
Model whose particle content is that of three complete $\mathbf{27}$
representations of the gauge group $E_6$. Above the conventional GUT scale the
gauge group corresponds to a left-right symmetric Supersymmetric Pati-Salam
model, which may be regarded as a ``surrogate SUSY GUT'' with all the nice
features of SO(10) but without proton decay or doublet-triplet splitting
problems. At the TeV scale the extra exotic states may be discovered at the
LHC, providing an observable footprint of an underlying $E_6$ gauge group
broken at the Planck scale. Assuming an additional low energy $U(1)_X$ gauge
group, identified as a non-trivial combination of diagonal $E_6$ generators,
the $\mu$ problem of the MSSM can be resolved.
"
What is the effect of the electron dissipation region on the two-scale structure in a collisionless magnetic reconnection?,"  Particle in cell (PIC) simulations of collisionless magnetic reconnection are
presented that demonstrate that the electron dissipation region develops a
distinct two-scale structure along the outflow direction. The length of the
electron current layer is found to decrease with decreasing electron mass,
approaching the ion inertial length for a proton-electron plasma. A surprise,
however, is that the electrons form a high-velocity outflow jet that remains
decoupled from the magnetic field and extends large distances downstream from
the x-line. The rate of reconnection remains fast in very large systems,
independent of boundary conditions and the mass of electrons.
"
What are the implications of the discovery of a nova in the M31 system?,"  We analyse a series of pilot observations in order to study microlensing of
(unresolved) stars in M31 with the 1.5m Loiano telescope, including
observations on both identified variable source stars and reported microlensing
events. We also look for previously unknown variability and discover a nova. We
discuss an observing strategy for an extended campaign with the goal of
determining whether MACHOs exist or whether all microlensing events are
compatible with lens stars in M31.
"
What are the charged hadrons identified in the final state?,"  We present new sets of pion, kaon, proton and inclusive charged hadron
fragmentation functions obtained in NLO combined analyses of single-inclusive
hadron production in electron-positron annihilation, proton-proton collisions,
and deep-inelastic lepton-proton scattering with either particles identified in
the final state. At variance with all previous fits, the present analyses take
into account data where hadrons of different electrical charge are identified,
which allow to discriminate quark from anti-quark fragmentation functions.
"
What is the relationship between the Raman peaks and the number of pentagon defects in SWNT IMJs?,"  The vibrational modes of some single wall carbon nanotube (SWNT)
intramolecular junctions (IMJs) have been calculated using the newest Brenner
reactive empirical bond order (REBO) potential, based upon which their
nonresonant Raman spectra have been further calculated using the empirical bond
polarizability model. It is found that the Raman peaks induced by pentagon
defects lie out of the $G$-band of the SWNTs, so the high-frequency part of the
Raman spectra of the SWNT IMJs can be used to determine experimentally their
detailed geometrical structures. Also, the intensity of the Raman spectra has a
close relation with the number of pentagon defects in the SWNT IMJs. Following
the Descartes-Euler Polyhedral Formula (DEPF), the number of heptagon defects
in the SWNT IMJs can also be determined. The first-principle calculations are
also performed, verifying the results obtained by the REBO potential. The $G$
band width of the SWNT IMJ can reflect the length of its transition region
between the pentagon and heptagon rings.
"
What are the quantum critical points in the quantum phase transitions in a ferromagnet with finite size?,"  We present results of extensive finite-temperature Quantum Monte Carlo
simulations on a SU(2) symmetric S=1/2 quantum antiferromagnet with a four-spin
interaction [Sandvik, Phys. Rev. Lett. 98, 227202 (2007)]. Our simulations,
which are free of the sign-problem and carried out on lattices containing in
excess of 1.6 X 10^4 spins, indicate that the four-spin interaction destroys
the N\'eel order at an unconventional z=1 quantum critical point, producing a
valence-bond solid paramagnet. Our results are consistent with the `deconfined
quantum criticality' scenario.
"
What is the method for extracting generalized parton distributions from lattice moments?,"  We propose a physically motivated parametrization for the unpolarized
generalized parton distributions, H and E, valid at both zero and non-zero
values of the skewness variable, \zeta. Our approach follows a previous
detailed study of the \zeta=0 case where H and E were determined using
constraints from simultaneous fits of the experimental data on both the nucleon
elastic form factors and the deep inelastic structure functions in the non
singlet sector. Additional constraints at \zeta \neq 0 are provided by lattice
calculations of the higher moments of generalized parton distributions. We
illustrate a method for extracting generalized parton distributions from
lattice moments based on a reconstruction using sets of orthogonal polynomials.
The inclusion in our fit of data on Deeply Virtual Compton Scattering is also
discussed. Our method provides a step towards a model independent extraction of
generalized distributions from the data. It also provides an alternative to
double distributions based phenomenological models in that we are able to
satisfy the polynomiality condition by construction, using a combination of
experimental data and lattice, without resorting to any specific mathematical
construct.
"
How does the wind termination shock influence the neutrino-heated ejecta from a nascent neutron star?,"  Recent hydrodynamic studies of core-collapse supernovae imply that the
neutrino-heated ejecta from a nascent neutron star develops to supersonic
outflows. These supersonic winds are influenced by the reverse shock from the
preceding supernova ejecta, forming the wind termination shock. We investigate
the effects of the termination shock in neutrino-driven winds and its roll on
the r-process. Supersonic outflows are calculated with a semi-analytic
neutrino-driven wind model. Subsequent termination-shocked, subsonic outflows
are obtained by applying the Rankine-Hugoniot relations. We find a couple of
effects that can be relevant for the r-process. First is the sudden slowdown of
the temperature decrease by the wind termination. Second is the entropy jump by
termination-shock heating, up to several 100NAk. Nucleosynthesis calculations
in the obtained winds are performed to examine these effects on the r-process.
We find that 1) the slowdown of the temperature decrease plays a decisive roll
to determine the r-process abundance curves. This is due to the strong
dependences of the nucleosynthetic path on the temperature during the r-process
freezeout phase. Our results suggest that only the termination-shocked winds
with relatively small shock radii (~500km) are relevant for the bulk of the
solar r-process abundances (A~100-180). The heaviest part in the solar
r-process curve (A~180-200), however, can be reproduced both in shocked and
unshocked winds. These results may help to constrain the mass range of
supernova progenitors relevant for the r-process. We find, on the other hand,
2) negligible roles of the entropy jump on the r-process. This is a consequence
that the sizable entropy increase takes place only at a large shock radius
(~10,000km) where the r-process has already ceased.
"
What is the construction of deformation quantizations of Poisson structures on E*?,"  In the present paper we explicitly construct deformation quantizations of
certain Poisson structures on E^*, where E -> M is a Lie algebroid. Although
the considered Poisson structures in general are far from being regular or even
symplectic, our construction gets along without Kontsevich's formality theorem
but is based on a generalized Fedosov construction. As the whole construction
merely uses geometric structures of E we also succeed in determining the
dependence of the resulting star products on these data in finding appropriate
equivalence transformations between them. Finally, the concreteness of the
construction allows to obtain explicit formulas even for a wide class of
derivations and self-equivalences of the products. Moreover, we can show that
some of our products are in direct relation to the universal enveloping algebra
associated to the Lie algebroid. Finally, we show that for a certain class of
star products on E^* the integration with respect to a density with vanishing
modular vector field defines a trace functional.
"
What are the finite element methods used to solve the nonlinear coupled equations?,"  We consider a problem of nuclear waste contamination. It takes into account
the thermal effects. The temperature and the contaminant's concentration
fulfill convection-diffusion-reaction equations. The velocity and the pressure
in the flow satisfy the Darcy equation, with a viscosity depending on both
concentration and temperature. The equations are nonlinear and strongly
coupled. Using both finite volume and nonconforming finite element methods, we
introduce a scheme adapted to this problem. We prove the stability and
convergence of this scheme and give some error estimates.
"
Can the Fisher matrix analysis of weak lensing surveys constrain the parameter gamma in dark energy models?,"  We consider the extent to which future imaging surveys of galaxies can
distinguish between dark energy and modified gravity models for the origin of
the cosmic acceleration. Dynamical dark energy models may have similar
expansion rates as models of modified gravity, yet predict different growth of
structure histories. We parameterize the cosmic expansion by the two
parameters, $w_0$ and $w_a$, and the linear growth rate of density fluctuations
by Linder's $\gamma$, independently. Dark energy models generically predict
$\gamma \approx 0.55$, while the DGP model $\gamma \approx 0.68$. To determine
if future imaging surveys can constrain $\gamma$ within 20 percent (or
$\Delta\gamma<0.1$), we perform the Fisher matrix analysis for a weak lensing
survey such as the on-going Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) project. Under the
condition that the total observation time is fixed, we compute the Figure of
Merit (FoM) as a function of the exposure time $\texp$. We find that the
tomography technique effectively improves the FoM, which has a broad peak
around $\texp\simeq {\rm several}\sim 10$ minutes; a shallow and wide survey is
preferred to constrain the $\gamma$ parameter. While $\Delta\gamma < 0.1$
cannot be achieved by the HSC weak-lensing survey alone, one can improve the
constraints by combining with a follow-up spectroscopic survey like WFMOS
and/or future CMB observations.
"
What are the implications of the corrected formula for the implied volatility in time to maturity?,"  In this small note we use results derived in Berestycki et al. to correct the
celebrated formulae of Hagan et al. We derive explicitly the correct zero order
term in the expansion of the implied volatility in time to maturity. The new
term is consistent as $\beta\to 1$. Furthermore, numerical simulations show
that it reduces or eliminates known pathologies of the earlier formula.
"
What is the inductive approach to the lace expansion?,"  We extend the inductive approach to the lace expansion, previously developed
to study models with critical dimension 4, to be applicable more generally. In
particular, the result of this note has recently been used to prove Gaussian
asymptotic behaviour for the Fourier transform of the two-point function for
sufficiently spread-out lattice trees in dimensions d>8, and it is potentially
also applicable to percolation in dimensions d>6.
"
What is the optical CNOT gate used to transform the triple photon input states?,"  We propose an experimental setup that is capable of unambiguously
discriminating any pair of linearly independent single photon polarization
qubits, about which we don't have any knowledge except that an extra pair of
these unknown states are provided as the reference. This setup, which is
constructed with optical CNOT gates, weak cross Kerr non-linearities, Bell
state analysers and other linear optical elements, transforms the unknown
triple photon input states to the corresponding single photon states to be
deterministically processed by linear optics circuit. The optimal
discrimination of the unknown states is achieved by this setup.
"
What is the role of X-ray magnetic circular dichroism in the study of perovskite manganites?,"  Surface magnetic properties of perovskite manganites have been a recurrent
topic during last years since they play a major role in the implementation of
magnetoelectronic devices. Magneto-optical techniques, such as X-ray magnetic
circular dichroism, turn out to be a very efficient tool to study surface
magnetism due to their sensitivity to magnetic and chemical variations across
the sample depth. Nevertheless, the application of the sum rules for the
determination of the spin magnetic moment might lead to uncertainties as large
as 40% in case of Mn ions. To overcome this problem we present an alternative
approach consisting of using X-ray magnetic circular dichroism in reflection
geometry. Fit of the data by using a computer code based in a 4X4 matrix
formalism leads to realistic results. In particular, we show that surface and
interface roughness are of major relevance for a proper description of the
experimental data and a correct interpretation of the results. By using such an
approach we demonstrate the presence of a narrow surface region with strongly
depressed magnetic properties in La2/3Ca1/3MnO3 thin films.
"
What is the moduli space of exponentially asymptotically cylindrical torsion-free G_2 structures?,"  We prove that for a 7-dimensional manifold M with cylindrical ends the moduli
space of exponentially asymptotically cylindrical torsion-free G_2 structures
is a smooth manifold (if non-empty), and study some of its local properties. We
also show that the holonomy of the induced metric of an exponentially
asymptotically cylindrical G_2 manifold M is exactly G_2 if and only if its
fundamental group is finite and neither M nor any double cover of M is
homeomorphic to a cylinder.
"
What are the implications of the IVC nonlinearity exceeding the intrinsic ones at high heat loads?,"  The recent PRB, henceforth referred as Ref.[1], experimentally resolves the
intrinsic shape of the c-axis current-voltage characteristics (IVC) of HTSC and
demonstrates that at sufficiently high heat loads the heating-induced IVC
nonlinearities exceed the intrinsic ones so radically that the latter might be
safely ignored.
  The author of the comment fails to take account of the experimental findings
by Ref.[1] and seeks to cast doubt on all its conclusions through reference to
a brush-like IVC, which is claimed to be free of heating. I will show that this
claim lacks substantiation; indeed it can be stated with certainty that the IVC
is not free from heating. I will further show that the data selected for this
comment make it possible to explore for the first time the effect of
temperature on a range of loads where the genuine response is not hidden by
heating and to demonstrate for the first time that $R(T)$ of the same sample is
responsible for a rich variety of IVC behaviours taken above and below $T_c$ at
bath temperatures spanned over 180K. Thus these data in fact provide strong
novel evidence in favour of the major conclusions by Ref.[1], in particular the
extrinsic cause of the key findings by intrinsic tunnelling spectroscopy.
"
What is the mechanism of electroweak bosons in the Standard Model?,"  The top quark and electroweak bosons (W and Z) represent the most massive
fundamental particles yet discovered, and as such refer directly to the
Standard Model's greatest remaining mystery: the mechanism by which all
particles gained mass. This report summarizes the work done within the top-ew
group of the Tevatron-for-LHC workshop. It represents a collection of both
Tevatron results, and LHC predictions. The hope is that by considering and
comparing both machines, the LHC program can be improved and aided by knowledge
from the Tevatron, and that particle physics as a whole can be enriched. The
report includes measurements of the top quark mass, searches for single top
quark production, and physics of the electroweak bosons at hadron colliders.
"
What is the definition of $N_n(\al)$?,"  Let $\{X(v), v \in \Bbb Z^d \times \Bbb Z_+\}$ be an i.i.d. family of random
variables such that $P\{X(v)= e^b\}=1-P\{X(v)= 1\} = p$ for some $b>0$. We
consider paths $\pi \subset \Bbb Z^d \times \Bbb Z_+$ starting at the origin
and with the last coordinate increasing along the path, and of length $n$.
Define for such paths $W(\pi) = \text{number of vertices $\pi_i, 1 \le i \le
n$, with}X(\pi_i) = e^b$. Finally let $N_n(\al) = \text{number of paths $\pi$
of length $n$ starting at $\pi_0 = \bold 0$ and with $W(\pi) \ge \al n$.}$ We
establish several properties of $\lim_{n \to \infty} [N_n]^{1/n}$.
"
What is the Euler characteristic of a cell complex?,"  The Euler characteristic of a cell complex is often thought of as the
alternating sum of the number of cells of each dimension. When the complex is
infinite, the sum diverges. Nevertheless, it can sometimes be evaluated; in
particular, this is possible when the complex is the nerve of a finite
category. This provides an alternative definition of the Euler characteristic
of a category, which is in many cases equivalent to the original one
(math.CT/0610260).
"
What is the nature of the transition from extended to floppy bilayer?,"  Two kinds of simulated bilayers are described and the results are reported
for lateral tension and for partial contributions of intermolecular forces to
it.Data for a widest possible range of areas per surfactant head, from tunnel
formation through tensionless state, transition to floppy bilayer,to its
disintegration, are reported and discussed. The significance of the tensionless
state, is discussed. Conclusions: (1) the tensionless state is a
coincidence;(2) the transition from extended to floppy bilayer occurs nearby
and has hallmarks of a phase transition (3) there is no theory of that
transition.(4)The lateral tension of the floppy bilayer scales with size; that
of the extended bilayer does not depend on size. (4) The drumhead model not
appropriate for interfaces as these fluctuate via diffusion.(5) The radius of
gyration also! shows a discontinuity.
"
What is the localization-delocalization (LD) transition in the lowest Landau level?,"  We investigate, analytically and numerically, the effects of disorder on the
density of states and on the localization properties of the relativistic two
dimensional fermions in the lowest Landau level. Employing a supersymmetric
technique, we calculate the exact density of states for the Cauchy (Lorentzian)
distribution for various types of disorders. We use a numerical technique to
establish the localization-delocalization (LD) transition in the lowest Landau
level. For some types of disorder the LD transition is shown to belong to a
different universality class, as compared to the corresponding nonrelativistic
problem. The results are relevant to the integer quantum Hall plateau
transitions observed in graphene.
"
What are the advantages of the maximum likelihood method for estimating the spherical-harmonic power spectrum?,"  We address the problem of estimating the spherical-harmonic power spectrum of
a statistically isotropic scalar signal from noise-contaminated data on a
region of the unit sphere. Three different methods of spectral estimation are
considered: (i) the spherical analogue of the one-dimensional (1-D)
periodogram, (ii) the maximum likelihood method, and (iii) a spherical analogue
of the 1-D multitaper method. The periodogram exhibits strong spectral leakage,
especially for small regions of area $A\ll 4\pi$, and is generally unsuitable
for spherical spectral analysis applications, just as it is in 1-D. The maximum
likelihood method is particularly useful in the case of nearly-whole-sphere
coverage, $A\approx 4\pi$, and has been widely used in cosmology to estimate
the spectrum of the cosmic microwave background radiation from spacecraft
observations. The spherical multitaper method affords easy control over the
fundamental trade-off between spectral resolution and variance, and is easily
implemented regardless of the region size, requiring neither non-linear
iteration nor large-scale matrix inversion. As a result, the method is ideally
suited for most applications in geophysics, geodesy or planetary science, where
the objective is to obtain a spatially localized estimate of the spectrum of a
signal from noisy data within a pre-selected and typically small region.
"
What are the conditions under which self-dual vertex operator super algebras (SVOAs) exist?,"  We investigate self-dual vertex operator algebras (VOAs) and super algebras
(SVOAs). Using the genus one correlation functions, it is shown that self-dual
SVOAs exist only for half-integral central charges. It is described how
self-dual SVOAs can be constructed from self-dual VOAs of larger central
charge. The analogy with integral lattices and binary codes is emphasized.
  One main result is the construction of the shorter Moonshine module, a
self-dual SVOA of central charge 23.5 on which the Baby monster - the second
largest sporadic simple group - acts by automorphisms. The shorter Moonshine
module has the character q^(-47/48)*(1+ 4371q^(3/2)+ 96256q^2+ 1143745q^(5/2)
+...) and is the ""shorter cousin"" of the Moonshine module. Its lattice and code
analog are the shorter Leech lattice and shorter Golay code. We conjecture that
the shorter Moonshine module is the unique SVOA with this character.
  The final chapter introduces the notion of extremal VOAs and SVOAs. These are
self-dual (S)VOAs with character having the same first few coefficients as the
vacuum representation of the Virasoro algebra of the same central charge. We
show that extremal VOAs exist at least for the central charges 8, 16, 24, 32,
40 and that extremal SVOAs exist only for the central charges c=0.5, 1, ...,
7.5, 8, 12, 14, 15, 15.5, 23.5 and 24. Examples for c=24 (resp. 23.5) are the
(shorter) Moonshine module. Again, our results are similar to results known for
codes and lattices.
"
What are the prospects for future applications of these methods and techniques?,"  Methods and techniques of the theory of nonlinear dynamical systems and
patterns can be useful in astrophysical applications. Some works on the
subjects of dynamical astronomy, stellar pulsation and variability, as well as
spatial complexity in extended systems, in which such approaches have already
been utilized, are reviewed. Prospects for future directions in applications of
this kind are outlined.
"
What is the crossover behavior of the Fermi liquid as a function of the Fermi energy?,"  The X-ray edge problem of graphene with the Dirac fermion spectrum is
studied. At half-filling the linear density of states suppresses the singular
response of the Fermi liquid, while away from half-filling the singular
features of the Fermi liquid reappear. The crossover behavior as a function of
the Fermi energy is examined in detail. The exponent of the power-law
absorption rate depends both on the intra- and inter-valley scattering, and it
changes as a function of the Fermi energy, which may be tested experimentally.
"
What are the implications of the Schur-Weyl duality for Brauer algebras and classical groups?,"  After reviewing classical Schur-Weyl duality, we present some other contexts
which enjoy similar features, relating to Brauer algebras and classical groups.
"
Is the Wigner-Yanase entropy subadditivity property general for quantum systems?,"  It was recently shown by Hansen that the Wigner-Yanase entropy is, for
general states of quantum systems, not subadditive with respect to
decomposition into two subsystems, although this property is known to hold for
pure states. We investigate the question whether the weaker property of
subadditivity for pure states with respect to decomposition into more than two
subsystems holds. This property would have interesting applications in quantum
chemistry. We show, however, that it does not hold in general, and provide a
counterexample.
"
What is the impact of the inclusion of CP violating scattering asymmetry on the final value of the lepton asymmetry?,"  We obtain the Boltzmann equations for leptogenesis including decay and
scattering processes with two and three body initial or final states. We
present an explicit computation of the CP violating scattering asymmetries. We
analyze their possible impact in leptogenesis, and we discuss the validity of
their approximate expressions in terms of the decay asymmetry. In scenarios in
which the initial heavy neutrino density vanishes, the inclusion of CP
asymmetries in scatterings can enforce a cancellation between the lepton
asymmetry generated at early times and the asymmetry produced at later times.
We argue that a sizeable amount of washout is crucial for spoiling this
cancellation, and we show that in the regimes in which the washouts are
particularly weak, the inclusion of CP violation in scatterings yields a
reduction in the final value of the lepton asymmetry. In the strong washout
regimes the inclusion of CP violation in scatterings still leads to a
significant enhancement of the lepton asymmetry at high temperatures; however,
due to the independence from the early conditions that is characteristic of
these regimes, the final value of the lepton asymmetry remains approximately
unchanged.
"
What are the implications of the base manifold having a negative constant Ricci scalar in the Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theory?,"  An exhaustive classification of certain class of static solutions for the
five-dimensional Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theory in vacuum is presented. The class
of metrics under consideration is such that the spacelike section is a warped
product of the real line with a nontrivial base manifold. It is shown that for
generic values of the coupling constants the base manifold must be necessarily
of constant curvature, and the solution reduces to the topological extension of
the Boulware-Deser metric. It is also shown that the base manifold admits a
wider class of geometries for the special case when the Gauss-Bonnet coupling
is properly tuned in terms of the cosmological and Newton constants. This
freedom in the metric at the boundary, which determines the base manifold,
allows the existence of three main branches of geometries in the bulk. For
negative cosmological constant, if the boundary metric is such that the base
manifold is arbitrary, but fixed, the solution describes black holes whose
horizon geometry inherits the metric of the base manifold. If the base manifold
possesses a negative constant Ricci scalar, two different kinds of wormholes in
vacuum are obtained. For base manifolds with vanishing Ricci scalar, a
different class of solutions appears resembling ""spacetime horns"". There is
also a special case for which, if the base manifold is of constant curvature,
due to certain class of degeneration of the field equations, the metric admits
an arbitrary redshift function. For wormholes and spacetime horns, there are
regions for which the gravitational and centrifugal forces point towards the
same direction. All these solutions have finite Euclidean action, which reduces
to the free energy in the case of black holes, and vanishes in the other cases.
Their mass is also obtained from a surface integral.
"
What are the peculiar features of quantum imaging?,"  One of the most surprising consequences of quantum mechanics is the
entanglement of two or more distant particles. Although questions regarding
fundamental issues of quantum theory still exist, quantum entanglement has
started to play important roles in practical engineering applications. Quantum
imaging is one of these exciting areas. Quantum imaging has demonstrated two
peculiar features: (1) reproducing ""ghost"" images in a ""nonlocal"" manner, and
(2) enhancing the spatial resolution of imaging beyond the diffraction limit.
In this article, we start with the review of classical imaging to establish the
basic concepts and formalisms of imaging. We then analyze two-photon imaging
with particular emphasis on the physics of spatial resolution enhancement and
the ""ghost"" imaging phenomenon.
"
What is the parameterized Robertson-Walker geometry in the Robertson-Walker Universe?,"  Using a novel, string theory-inspired formalism based on a Hamiltonian
constraint, we obtain a conformal mechanical system for the spatially flat
four-dimensional Robertson-Walker Universe. Depending on parameter choices,
this system describes either a relativistic particle in the Robertson-Walker
background, or metric fluctuations of the Robertson-Walker geometry. Moreover
we derive a tree-level M-theory matrix model in this time-dependent background.
Imposing the Hamiltonian constraint forces the spacetime geometry to be fuzzy
near the big bang, while the classical Robertson-Walker geometry emerges as the
Universe expands. From our approach we also derive the temperature of the
Universe interpolating between the radiation and matter dominated eras.
"
What is the impact of the CLAS and COMPASS data on polarized parton densities and higher twist effects?,"  The impact of the recent very precise CLAS and COMPASS g_1/F_1 data on
polarized parton densities and higher twist effects is discussed. We
demonstrate that the low Q^2 CLAS data improve essentially our knowledge of
higher twist corrections to the spin structure function g1, while the large Q^2
COMPASS data influence mainly the strange quark and gluon polarizations which
slightly decrease. We find also that the present inclusive DIS data cannot rule
out a negative polarized and changing in sign gluon densities.
"
What is the superpotential in a supersymmetric gauge theory for a generic choice of a point on the Coulomb branch?,"  We show that, for a generic choice of a point on the Coulomb branch of any
N=2 supersymmetric gauge theory, it is possible to find a superpotential
perturbation which generates a metastable vacuum at the point. For theories
with SU(N) gauge group, such a superpotential can be expressed as a sum of
single-trace terms for N=2 and 3. If the metastable point is chosen at the
origin of the moduli space, we can show that the superpotential can be a
single-trace operator for any N. In both cases, the superpotential is a
polynomial of degree 3N of the vector multiplet scalar field.
"
How can coherence and phase synchronization between time series be generalized to pairs of multivariate time series?,"  Coherence and phase synchronization between time series corresponding to
different spatial locations are usually interpreted as indicators of the
connectivity between locations. In neurophysiology, time series of electric
neuronal activity are essential for studying brain interconnectivity. Such
signals can either be invasively measured from depth electrodes, or computed
from very high time resolution, non-invasive, extracranial recordings of scalp
electric potential differences (EEG: electroencephalogram) and magnetic fields
(MEG: magnetoencephalogram) by means of a tomography such as sLORETA
(standardized low resolution brain electromagnetic tomography). There are two
problems in this case. First, in the usual situation of unknown cortical
geometry, the estimated signal at each brain location is a vector with three
components (i.e. a current density vector), which means that coherence and
phase synchronization must be generalized to pairs of multivariate time series.
Second, the inherent low spatial resolution of the EEG/MEG tomography
introduces artificially high zero-lag coherence and phase synchronization. In
this report, solutions to both problems are presented. Two additional
generalizations are briefly mentioned: (1) conditional coherence and phase
synchronization; and (2) non-stationary time-frequency analysis. Finally, a
non-parametric randomization method for connectivity significance testing is
outlined. The new connectivity measures proposed here can be applied to pairs
of univariate EEG/MEG signals, as is traditional in the published literature.
However, these calculations cannot be interpreted as connectivity, since it is
in general incorrect to associate an extracranial electrode or sensor to the
underlying cortex.
"
What are the methodological contributions to resource allocation for system reliability assessment?,"  The systems that statisticians are asked to assess, such as nuclear weapons,
infrastructure networks, supercomputer codes and munitions, have become
increasingly complex. It is often costly to conduct full system tests. As such,
we present a review of methodology that has been proposed for addressing system
reliability with limited full system testing. The first approaches presented in
this paper are concerned with the combination of multiple sources of
information to assess the reliability of a single component. The second general
set of methodology addresses the combination of multiple levels of data to
determine system reliability. We then present developments for complex systems
beyond traditional series/parallel representations through the use of Bayesian
networks and flowgraph models. We also include methodological contributions to
resource allocation considerations for system relability assessment. We
illustrate each method with applications primarily encountered at Los Alamos
National Laboratory.
"
What is the relationship between the Hartree-Fock-Kohn-Sham equations and the Hartree-Fock-Kohn-Sham equations?,"  Following a recent work [Gal, Phys. Rev. A 64, 062503 (2001)], a simple
derivation of the density-functional correction of the Hartree-Fock equations,
the Hartree-Fock-Kohn-Sham equations, is presented, completing an integrated
view of quantum mechanical theories, in which the Kohn-Sham equations, the
Hartree-Fock-Kohn-Sham equations and the ground-state Schrodinger equation
formally stem from a common ground: density-functional theory, through its
Euler equation for the ground-state density. Along similar lines, the Kohn-Sham
formulation of the Hartree-Fock approach is also considered. Further, it is
pointed out that the exchange energy of density-functional theory built from
the Kohn-Sham orbitals can be given by degree-two homogeneous N-particle
density functionals (N=1,2,...), forming a sequence of degree-two homogeneous
exchange-energy density functionals, the first element of which is minus the
classical Coulomb-repulsion energy functional.
"
How do the quark-antiquark annihilation processes affect the quark and antiquark fragmentation functions in a nucleus?,"  Modifications to quark and antiquark fragmentation functions due to
quark-quark (antiquark) double scattering in nuclear medium are studied
systematically up to order \cal{O}(\alpha_{s}^2)$ in deeply inelastic
scattering (DIS) off nuclear targets. At the order $\cal{O}(\alpha_s^2)$,
twist-four contributions from quark-quark (antiquark) rescattering also exhibit
the Landau-Pomeranchuck-Midgal (LPM) interference feature similar to gluon
bremsstrahlung induced by multiple parton scattering. Compared to quark-gluon
scattering, the modification, which is dominated by $t$-channel quark-quark
(antiquark) scattering, is only smaller by a factor of $C_F/C_A=4/9$ times the
ratio of quark and gluon distributions in the medium. Such a modification is
not negligible for realistic kinematics and finite medium size. The
modifications to quark (antiquark) fragmentation functions from quark-antiquark
annihilation processes are shown to be determined by the antiquark (quark)
distribution density in the medium. The asymmetry in quark and antiquark
distributions in nuclei will lead to different modifications of quark and
antiquark fragmentation functions inside a nucleus, which qualitatively
explains the experimentally observed flavor dependence of the leading hadron
suppression in semi-inclusive DIS off nuclear targets. The quark-antiquark
annihilation processes also mix quark and gluon fragmentation functions in the
large fractional momentum region, leading to a flavor dependence of jet
quenching in heavy-ion collisions.
"
What is the interaction between a small quantum system and a large system described by unknown stochastic variables?,"  A small quantum scattering system (the microsystem) is studied in interaction
with a large system (the macrosystem) described by unknown stochastic
variables. The interaction between the two systems is diagonal for the
microsystem in a certain orthonormal basis, and the interaction gives an
imprint on the macrosystem. Moreover, the interaction is assumed to involve
only small transfers of energy and momentum between the two systems (as
compared to typical energies/momenta within the microsystem). The analysis is
carried out within scattering theory. Calculated in the conventional way, the
transition amplitude for the whole system factorizes. The interaction taking
place within the macrosystem is assumed to depend on the stochastic variables
in such a way that, on the average, no particular basis vector state of the
microsystem is favoured. The density matrix is studied in a formalism which
includes generation of the ingoing state and absorption of the final state.
Then the dependence of the final state on the conventional scattering amplitude
for the microsystem is highly non-linear.
  In the thermodynamic limit of the macrosystem, the density matrix of the
ensemble (of microsystem plus macrosystem) develops into a final state which
involves a set of macroscopically distinguishable states, each with the
microsystem in one of the basis vector states and the macrosystem in an
entangled state.
  For an element of the ensemble, i.e., for a single measurement, the result is
instead a random walk, where the microsystem ends up in one of the basis vector
states (reduction of the wave packet).
"
What is the technique used to estimate the expectation of certain functionals in the Black and Scholes model?,"  Taking advantage of the recent litterature on exact simulation algorithms
(Beskos, Papaspiliopoulos and Roberts) and unbiased estimation of the
expectation of certain fonctional integrals (Wagner, Beskos et al. and
Fearnhead et al.), we apply an exact simulation based technique for pricing
continuous arithmetic average Asian options in the Black and Scholes framework.
Unlike existing Monte Carlo methods, we are no longer prone to the
discretization bias resulting from the approximation of continuous time
processes through discrete sampling. Numerical results of simulation studies
are presented and variance reduction problems are considered.
"
What is the main challenge in creating optomechanical systems that couple quantum and classical physics?,"  Macroscopic mechanical objects and electromagnetic degrees of freedom couple
to each other via radiation pressure. Optomechanical systems with sufficiently
strong coupling are predicted to exhibit quantum effects and are a topic of
considerable interest. Devices reaching this regime would offer new types of
control of the quantum state of both light and matter and would provide a new
arena in which to explore the boundary between quantum and classical physics.
Experiments to date have achieved sufficient optomechanical coupling to
laser-cool mechanical devices but have not yet reached the quantum regime. The
outstanding technical challenge in this field is integrating sensitive
micromechanical elements (which must be small, light, and flexible) into high
finesse cavities (which are typically much more rigid and massive) without
compromising the mechanical or optical properties of either. A second, and more
fundamental, challenge is to read out the mechanical element's quantum state:
displacement measurements (no matter how sensitive) cannot determine the energy
eigenstate of an oscillator, and measurements which couple to quantities other
than displacement have been difficult to realize. Here we present a novel
optomechanical system which seems to resolve both these challenges. We
demonstrate a cavity which is detuned by the motion of a thin dielectric
membrane placed between two macroscopic, rigid, high-finesse mirrors. This
approach segregates optical and mechanical functionality to physically distinct
structures and avoids compromising either. It also allows for direct
measurement of the square of the membrane's displacement, and thus in principle
the membrane's energy eigenstate. We estimate it should be practical to use
this scheme to observe quantum jumps of a mechanical system.
"
What are the properties of quasi-linear regimes of the nonlinear Schrödinger equation?,"  It is shown that the tight-binding approximation of the nonlinear
Schr\""odinger equation with a periodic linear potential and periodic in space
nonlinearity coefficient gives rise to a number of nonlinear lattices with
complex, both linear and nonlinear, neighbor interactions. The obtained
lattices present non-standard possibilities, among which we mention a
quasi-linear regime, where the pulse dynamics obeys essentially the linear
Schr{\""o}dinger equation. We analyze the properties of such models both in
connection with their modulational stability, as well as in regard to the
existence and stability of their localized solitary wave solutions.
"
What are the Lie algebras F4 and E8?,"  We present a geometric construction of the exceptional Lie algebras F4 and E8
starting from the round 8- and 15-spheres, respectively, inspired by the
construction of the Killing superalgebra of a supersymmetric supergravity
background. (There is no supergravity in the paper.)
"
What is the relationship between the ideal coherent state and the effects of departure from coherence of a wave packet in a nonlinear medium?,"  Treating the ideal coherent state as a reference state, the effects due to
departure from coherence of an initial wave packet propagating through a
nonlinear medium, were examined, specifically in the context of non-classical
effects such as revivals, fractional revivals, squeezing and higher-order
squeezing during its temporal evolution. Further, these studies were extended
to examine the role of quantum entanglement in bipartite systems. The dynamics
of quantum expectation values were tracked carefully in various cases and the
conditions under which a wave packet spreads chaotically, were investigated.
"
What is the relationship between the definite integral of the function x^p cos^n x and the sum of the definite integral of the function x^p cos^n x?,"  We present evalauations and provide proofs of definite integrals involving
the function x^p cos^n x. These formulae are generalizations of 3.761.11 and
3.822.1, among others, in the classical table of integrals by I. S. Gradshteyn
and I. M. Ryzhik.
"
What are the distinct and opposite phenomena of friction observed in the high temperature regime for NaCl(100)?,"  Alkali halide (100) crystal surfaces are poorly wetted by their own melt at
the triple point. We carried out simulations for NaCl(100) within the well
tested BMHFT model potential. Calculations of the solid-vapor, solid-liquid and
liquid-vapor free energies showed that solid NaCl(100) is a non-melting
surface, and explain its bad wetting in detail.
  The extreme stability of NaCl(100) is ideal for a study of the nanofriction
in the high temperature regime, close to and even above the bulk melting
temperature (T_M). Our simulations reveal in this regime two distinct and
opposite phenomena for plowing and for grazing friction. We found a frictional
drop close to T_M for deep ploughing and wear, but on the contrary a frictional
rise for grazing, wearless sliding. For both phenomena we obtain a fresh
microscopic understanding, relating the former to ``skating'' through a local
liquid cloud, the latter to softening of the free substrate surface. It is
argued that both phenomena, to be pursued experimentally, should be much more
general than the specific NaCl surface case. Most metals in particular
possessing one or more close packed non-melting surface, such as Pb, Al or
Au(111), should behave quite similarly.
"
What is the Robbins-Monro type SDE used for the semimartingale stochastic approximation?,"  The semimartingale stochastic approximation procedure, namely, the
Robbins-Monro type SDE is introduced which naturally includes both generalized
stochastic approximation algorithms with martingale noises and recursive
parameter estimation procedures for statistical models associated with
semimartingales. General results concerning the asymptotic behaviour of the
solution are presented. In particular, the conditions ensuring the convergence,
rate of convergence and asymptotic expansion are established. The results
concerning the Polyak weighted averaging procedure are also presented.
"
What is the evolution of the core radius of a droplet of atoms?,"  We present a diffusion Monte Carlo study of a vortex line excitation attached
to the center of a $^4$He droplet at zero temperature. The vortex energy is
estimated for droplets of increasing number of atoms, from N=70 up to 300
showing a monotonous increase with $N$. The evolution of the core radius and
its associated energy, the core energy, is also studied as a function of $N$.
The core radius is $\sim 1$ \AA in the center and increases when approaching
the droplet surface; the core energy per unit volume stabilizes at a value 2.8
K$\sigma^{-3}$ ($\sigma=2.556$ \AA) for $N \ge 200$.
"
What are the three independent frequencies with amplitudes below 0.01mag detected in the uvby passbands of V2104Cyg?,"  We obtained the first long, homogenous time-series of V2104Cyg, consisting of
679 datapoints, with the uvbybeta photometers of Sierra Nevada and San Pedro
Martir Observatories with the aim to detect and subsequently interpret the
intrinsic frequencies of this previously unstudied variable star, which turned
out to be a Be star. We try to figure out its place among the variable B stars
on the upper Main Sequence. In order to obtain additional information on
physical parameters we collected a few spectra with the ELODIE and FIES
instruments. We searched for frequencies in the uvby passbands using 2
different frequency analysis methods and used the S/N>4 criterion to select the
significant periodicities. We obtained an estimate of the physical parameters
of the underlying B star of spectral type between B5 and B7, by correcting for
the presence of a circumstellar disk, using a formalism based on the strenght
of the Halpha line emission. We detected 3 independent frequencies with
amplitudes below 0.01mag, f1 = 4.7126 c/d, f2 = 2.2342 c/d and f3 = 4.671 c/d,
and discovered that V2104Cyg is a Be star. The fast rotation (vsini=290+/-10
km/s, and 27<i<45) hampered the investigation of the associated pulsational
parameters l. Nevertheless, the most plausible explanation for the observed
variability of this mid-late type Be star is a non-radial pulsation model. This
paper is based on observations obtained at the Observatorio Astronomico
Nacional San Pedro Martir (Mexico), Observatorio de Sierra Nevada (Spain),
Observatoire de Haute Provence (France), and on observations made with the
Nordic Optical Telescope, Observatorio Roque de los Muchachos, La Palma, Spain.
"
What is the corresponding local well-posed result for a semilinear wave equation?,"  We get a local existence result in $H^s$ with $s>3/2$ for second order
quasilinear wave equation with radial initial data in 2+1 dimensions, based on
an improvement of Strichartz estimate in the radial case. Moreover, we get the
corresponding local well-posed result for semilinear wave equation. The
required index of regularity here is 1/4 less than the index 7/4, which is
essentially sharp in general.
"
What are the signatures of the Higgs decay $H \to \nu \nu$ in the model that includes a lepton number violating singlet scalar field?,"  We present and explore the Higgs physics of a model that in addition to the
Standard Model fields includes a lepton number violating singlet scalar field.
Based on the fact that the only experimental data we have so far for physics
beyond the Standard Model is that of neutrino physics, we impose a constraint
for any addition not to introduce new higher scales. As such, we introduce
right-handed neutrinos with an Electroweak Scale mass. We study the Higgs decay
$H \to \nu \nu$ and show that it leads to different signatures compared to
those in the Standard Model, making it possible to detect them and to probe the
nature of their couplings.
"
What are the benefits of the DUSEL laboratory site in the Mt. Stuart batholith?,"  One of the options for creating a Deep Underground Science and Engineering
Laboratory (DUSEL) is a site in the Mt. Stuart batholith, a granodiorite and
tonalite rock mass in the Cascade mountain range in Washington State. The
batholith's 100-year history in hard-rock tunneling includes the construction
of the longest and deepest tunnels in the U.S., the parallel Cascade and
Pioneer tunnels. The laboratory plan would utilize these two tunnels to produce
a laboratory that has many desirable features, including dedicated, clean,
horizontal access, container-module transport, and low operations costs.
Various aspects of the site help to reduce geotechnical, environmental, and
safety risks.
"
What are the K-π form-factor parameters measured for the decay?,"  We present a measurement of the K-$\pi$ form-factor parameters for the decay
  \klpmn. We use 328 pb^{-1} of data collected in 2001 and 2002, corresponding
to
  $\sim $ 1.8 million \semil events.
  Measurements of semileptonic form factors provide information about the
dynamics of the strong interaction and are necessary for evaluation of the
phase-space integral $I^\mu_K$ needed to measure the CKM matrix element
$|V_{us}|$ for \klpmn decays and to test lepton universality in kaon decays.
Using a new parameterization for the vector and scalar form factors we find
$\lambda_+$=\pt(25.6\pm 0.4_{\rm{stat.}}\pm 0.3_{\rm{syst.}}),-3, and
$\lambda_0$=\pt(14.3\pm 1.7_{\rm{stat.}}\pm 1.1_{\rm{stat.}}),-3,. In the more
usual quadratic expansion of the form factor the above result is corresponds to
$\lambda'_+=\lambda_+$, $\lambda''_+=2\lambda^2_+$, $\lambda'_0=\lambda_0$ and
$\lambda''_0=(\lambda^2_0+0.000416)/2$. Our results, together with recent
lattice calculations of $f_\pi$, $f_K$ and $f(0)$, satisfy the Callan-Trieman
relation.
"
What is the nature of the flattened molecular gas distribution around the YSO HW2?,"  Due to its relatively small distance (725 pc), the Cepheus A East
star-forming region is an ideal laboratory to study massive star formation
processes. Based on its morphology, it has been suggested that the flattened
molecular gas distribution around the YSO HW2 may be a 350-AU-radius massive
protostellar disk. Goal of our work is to ascertain the nature of this
structure. We have employed the Plateau de Bure Interferometer to acquire
(sub-)arcsecond-resolution imaging of high-density and shock tracers, such as
methyl cyanide (CH3CN) and silicon monoxide (SiO), towards the HW2 position. On
the 1-arcsecond (about 725 AU) scale, the flattened distribution of molecular
gas around HW2 appears to be due to the projected superposition, on the plane
of the sky, of at least three protostellar objects, of which at least one is
powering a molecular outflow at a small angle with respect to the line of
sight. The presence of a protostellar disk around HW2 is not ruled out, but
such structure is likely to be detected on a smaller spatial scale, or using
different molecular tracers.
"
What is the relationship between the entanglement of formation and the distillable entanglement in a bipartite system?,"  It is shown that, if the loss of entanglement along a quantum channel is
sufficiently small, then approximate quantum error correction is possible,
thereby generalizing what happens for coherent information. Explicit bounds are
obtained for the entanglement of formation and the distillable entanglement,
and their validity naturally extends to other bipartite entanglement measures
in between. Robustness of derived criteria is analyzed and their tightness
compared. Finally, as a byproduct, we prove a bound quantifying how large the
gap between entanglement of formation and distillable entanglement can be for
any given finite dimensional bipartite system, thus providing a sufficient
condition for distillability in terms of entanglement of formation.
"
What is the coherent excitation of a quantum dot with simultaneous collection of non-classical photon emission?,"  Narrow line-widths and the possibility of enhanced spontaneous emission via
coupling to microcavities make semiconductor quantum dots ideal for harnessing
coherent quantum phenomena at the single photon level. So far, however, all
approaches have relied on incoherent pumping, which limits the desirable
properties of the emission. In contrast, coherent excitation was recognized to
be necessary for providing both improved photon indistinguishability and high
efficiency, and offers the quantum control capabilities required for basic
qubit manipulations. Here we achieve, for the first time, resonant and coherent
excitation of a quantum dot with simultaneous collection of the non-classical
photon emission. Second-order correlation measurements show the unique
signature of a coherently-driven two-level quantum emitter: the photon
statistics become oscillatory at high driving fields, reflecting the coherent
evolution of the excitonic ground state of the quantum dot.
"
What are the conditions for a finite set of orthogonal quantum states to be distinguishable by separable operations?,"  We study the distinguishability of multipartite quantum states by separable
operations. We first present a necessary and sufficient condition for a finite
set of orthogonal quantum states to be distinguishable by separable operations.
An analytical version of this condition is derived for the case of $(D-1)$ pure
states, where $D$ is the total dimension of the state space under
consideration. A number of interesting consequences of this result are then
carefully investigated. Remarkably, we show there exists a large class of
$2\otimes 2$ separable operations not being realizable by local operations and
classical communication. Before our work only a class of $3\otimes 3$ nonlocal
separable operations was known [Bennett et al, Phys. Rev. A \textbf{59}, 1070
(1999)]. We also show that any basis of the orthogonal complement of a
multipartite pure state is indistinguishable by separable operations if and
only if this state cannot be a superposition of 1 or 2 orthogonal product
states, i.e., has an orthogonal Schmidt number not less than 3, thus generalize
the recent work about indistinguishable bipartite subspaces [Watrous, Phys.
Rev. Lett. \textbf{95}, 080505 (2005)]. Notably, we obtain an explicit
construction of indistinguishable subspaces of dimension 7 (or 6) by
considering a composite quantum system consisting of two qutrits (resp. three
qubits), which is slightly better than the previously known indistinguishable
bipartite subspace with dimension 8.
"
What is the average number of molecular clouds along the line of sight towards the majority of the sources observed?,"  Abridged: The Red MSX Source (RMS) survey is an ongoing multi-wavelength
observational programme designed to return a large, well-selected sample of
massive young stellar objects (MYSOs). Here we present 13CO observations made
towards 854 MYSOs candidates located in the 3rd and 4th quadrants. We detected
13CO emission towards a total of 751 of the 854 RMS sources observed (~88%). In
total 2185 emission components are detected above 3$\sigma$ level. Multiple
emission profiles are observed towards the majority of these sources - 455
sources (~60%) - with an average of ~4 molecular clouds along the line of
sight. These multiple emission features make it difficult to assign a kinematic
velocity to many of our sample. We have used archival CS (J=2-1) and maser
velocities to resolved the component multiplicity towards 82 sources and have
derived a criterion which is used to identify the most likely component for a
further 202 multiple component sources. Combined with the single component
detections we have obtained unambiguous kinematic velocities towards 580
sources (~80% of the detections). The 171 sources for which we have not been
able to determine the kinematic velocity will require additional line data.
Using the rotation curve of Brand and Blitz (1993) and their radial velocities
we calculate kinematic distances for all components detected.
"
What is the proposed scheme for one-way quantum computing based on the use of information encoded qubits in an effective cluster state resource?,"  We introduce a novel scheme for one-way quantum computing (QC) based on the
use of information encoded qubits in an effective cluster state resource. With
the correct encoding structure, we show that it is possible to protect the
entangled resource from phase damping decoherence, where the effective cluster
state can be described as residing in a Decoherence-Free Subspace (DFS) of its
supporting quantum system. One-way QC then requires either single or two-qubit
adaptive measurements. As an example where this proposal can be realized, we
describe an optical lattice setup where the scheme provides robust quantum
information processing. We also outline how one can adapt the model to provide
protection from other types of decoherence.
"
What is the vortex state of the pair potentials in the FFLO modulations?,"  We investigate the vortex state with Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO)
modulations suggested for a high field phase of CeCoIn_5. On the basis of the
quasiclassical Eilenberger theory, we calculate the three dimensional structure
of pair potentials, internal magnetic fields, paramagnetic moments, and
electronic states, for the s-wave and the d-wave pairings comparatively. The
\pi-phase shift of the pair potential at the FFLO nodal plane or at the vortex
core induces sharp peak states in the local density of states, and enhances the
local paramagnetic moment. We also discuss the NMR spectrum and the neutron
scattering as methods to detect the FFLO structure.
"
What are the pairing field used to describe the formation of Cooper pairs in ultracold Fermi-gases?,"  We study the exact renormalisation group flow for ultracold Fermi-gases in
unitary regime. We introduce a pairing field to describe the formation of the
Cooper pairs, and take a simple ansatz for the effective action. Set of
approximate flow equations for the effective couplings including boson and
fermionic fluctuations is derived. At some value of the running scale, the
system undergoes a phase transition to a gapped phase. The values of the energy
density, chemical potential, pairing gap and the corresponding proportionality
constants relating the interacting and non-interacting Fermi gases are
calculated. Standard mean field results are recovered if we omit the boson
loops.
"
What are the relevant parameters of the launched atoms in the MOT?,"  We present a compact $^{87}$Rb atomic source for high precision dual atom
interferometers. The source is based on a double-stage magneto-optical trap
(MOT) design, consisting of a 2-dimensional (2D)-MOT for efficient loading of a
3D-MOT. The accumulated atoms are precisely launched in a horizontal moving
molasses. Our setup generates a high atomic flux ($>10^{10}$ atoms/s) with
precise and flexibly tunable atomic trajectories as required for high
resolution Sagnac atom interferometry. We characterize the performance of the
source with respect to the relevant parameters of the launched atoms, i.e.
temperature, absolute velocity and pointing, by utilizing time-of-flight
techniques and velocity selective Raman transitions.
"
What is the effect of the abundance changes on the estimated Teff of giant stars?,"  We provide a grid of PHOENIX spectra of red giant and supergiant stars, that
extend through optical and near-IR wavelengths. For the first time, models are
also provided with modified surface abundances of C, N and O, as a step towards
accounting for the changes known to occur due to convective dredge-up (and to
be enhanced in the case of rotation). The aims are (i) to assess how well
current models reproduce observed spectra, (ii) to quantify the effects of the
abundance changes on the spectra, and (iii) to determine how these changes
affect estimates of fundamental stellar parameters.
  Observed giant star spectra can be fitted very well at solar metallicity down
to about 3400K. Modified surface abundances are preferred in only a minority of
cases for luminosity class II, possibly indicating mixing in excess of standard
first dredge-up.
  Supergiant stars show a larger variety of near-IR spectra, and good fits are
currently obtained for about one third of the observations only. Modified
surface abundances help reproducing strong CN bands, but do not suffice to
resolve all the difficulties. The effect of the abundance changes on the
estimated Teff depends on the wavelength range of observation and can amount
several 100K. Reasons for the remaining discrepancies are discussed.
"
How do the fluctuations of the largest eigenvalue of M_N vary with the distribution of the entries of W_N?,"  In this paper, we investigate the asymptotic spectrum of complex or real
Deformed Wigner matrices $(M_N)_N$ defined by $M_N=W_N/\sqrt{N}+A_N$ where
$W_N$ is an $N\times N$ Hermitian (resp., symmetric) Wigner matrix whose
entries have a symmetric law satisfying a Poincar\'{e} inequality. The matrix
$A_N$ is Hermitian (resp., symmetric) and deterministic with all but finitely
many eigenvalues equal to zero. We first show that, as soon as the first
largest or last smallest eigenvalues of $A_N$ are sufficiently far from zero,
the corresponding eigenvalues of $M_N$ almost surely exit the limiting
semicircle compact support as the size $N$ becomes large. The corresponding
limits are universal in the sense that they only involve the variance of the
entries of $W_N$. On the other hand, when $A_N$ is diagonal with a sole simple
nonnull eigenvalue large enough, we prove that the fluctuations of the largest
eigenvalue are not universal and vary with the particular distribution of the
entries of $W_N$.
"
What is the generalization of the result of B. Schwarz for analytic functions?,"  Quantitative estimates are obtained for the (finite) valence of functions
analytic in the unit disk with Schwarzian derivative that is bounded or of slow
growth. A harmonic mapping is shown to be uniformly locally univalent with
respect to the hyperbolic metric if and only if it has finite Schwarzian norm,
thus generalizing a result of B. Schwarz for analytic functions. A numerical
bound is obtained for the Schwarzian norms of univalent harmonic mappings.
"
What is the Ginzburg-Landau equation used to model the complex parameter regions of amplification and viscosity?,"  We study spatio-temporal chaos in the complex Ginzburg-Landau equation in
parameter regions of weak amplification and viscosity. Turbulent states
involving many soliton-like pulses appear in the parameter range, because the
complex Ginzburg-Landau equation is close to the nonlinear Schr\""odinger
equation. We find that the distributions of amplitude and wavenumber of pulses
depend only on the ratio of the two parameters of the amplification and the
viscosity. This implies that a one-parameter family of soliton turbulence
states characterized by different distributions of the soliton parameters
exists continuously around the completely integrable system.
"
What are the two categories of FUors based on the appearance of the 10 micron silicate feature?,"  (abridged) We present spectroscopy data for a sample of 14 FUors and 2 TTauri
stars observed with the Spitzer Space Telescope or with the Infrared Space
Observatory (ISO). Based on the appearance of the 10 micron silicate feature we
define 2 categories of FUors. Objects showing the silicate feature in
absorption (Category 1) are still embedded in a dusty and icy envelope. The
shape of the 10 micron silicate absorption bands is compared to typical dust
compositions of the interstellar medium and found to be in general agreement.
Only one object (RNO 1B) appears to be too rich in amorphous pyroxene dust, but
a superposed emission feature can explain the observed shape. We derive optical
depths and extinction values from the silicate band and additional ice bands at
6.0, 6.8 and 15.2 micron. In particular the analysis of the CO_2 ice band at
15.2 micron allows us to search for evidence for ice processing and constrains
whether the absorbing material is physically linked to the central object or in
the foreground. For objects showing the silicate feature in emission (Category
2), we argue that the emission comes from the surface layer of accretion disks.
Analyzing the dust composition reveals that significant grain growth has
already taken place within the accretion disks, but no clear indications for
crystallization are present. We discuss how these observational results can be
explained in the picture of a young, and highly active accretion disk. Finally,
a framework is proposed as to how the two categories of FUors can be understood
in a general paradigm of the evolution of young, low-mass stars. Only one
object (Parsamian 21) shows PAH emission features. Their shapes, however, are
often seen toward evolved stars and we question the object's status as a FUor
and discuss other possible classifications.
"
"What is the limiting distribution of the sequence $M_n=\max\{X_0,...,X_{n-1}\}$ for $n\geq0$?","  We consider the quadratic family of maps given by $f_{a}(x)=1-a x^2$ with
$x\in [-1,1]$, where $a$ is a Benedicks-Carleson parameter. For each of these
chaotic dynamical systems we study the extreme value distribution of the
stationary stochastic processes $X_0,X_1,...$, given by $X_{n}=f_a^n$, for
every integer $n\geq0$, where each random variable $X_n$ is distributed
according to the unique absolutely continuous, invariant probability of $f_a$.
Using techniques developed by Benedicks and Carleson, we show that the limiting
distribution of $M_n=\max\{X_0,...,X_{n-1}\}$ is the same as that which would
apply if the sequence $X_0,X_1,...$ was independent and identically
distributed. This result allows us to conclude that the asymptotic distribution
of $M_n$ is of Type III (Weibull).
"
What are the conceptual issues that arise when quasi-Hermitian framework is used to analyze scattering from localized non-Hermitian potentials?,"  We highlight the conceptual issues that arise when one applies the
quasi-Hermitian framework to analyze scattering from localized non-Hermitian
potentials, in particular complex square-wells or delta-functions. When treated
in the framework of conventional quantum mechanics, these potentials are
generally considered as effective theories, in which probability is not
conserved because of processes that have been ignored. However, if they are
treated as fundamental theories, the Hilbert-space metric must be changed. In
order for the newly-defined probability to be conserved, it must differ from
the standard one, even at asymptotically large distances from the scattering
centre, and the mechanism for this is the non-locality of the new metric, as we
show in detail in the model of a single complex delta function. However,
properties of distant bound-state systems, which do not interact physically
with the non-Hermitian scattering potential, should not be affected. We analyze
a model Hamiltonian that supports this contention.
"
How does the sparsity of the multipath channel impact the ergodic capacity in the UWB regime?,"  This paper studies the ergodic capacity of time- and frequency-selective
multipath fading channels in the ultrawideband (UWB) regime when training
signals are used for channel estimation at the receiver. Motivated by recent
measurement results on UWB channels, we propose a model for sparse multipath
channels. A key implication of sparsity is that the independent degrees of
freedom (DoF) in the channel scale sub-linearly with the signal space dimension
(product of signaling duration and bandwidth). Sparsity is captured by the
number of resolvable paths in delay and Doppler. Our analysis is based on a
training and communication scheme that employs signaling over orthogonal
short-time Fourier (STF) basis functions. STF signaling naturally relates
sparsity in delay-Doppler to coherence in time-frequency. We study the impact
of multipath sparsity on two fundamental metrics of spectral efficiency in the
wideband/low-SNR limit introduced by Verdu: first- and second-order optimality
conditions. Recent results by Zheng et. al. have underscored the large gap in
spectral efficiency between coherent and non-coherent extremes and the
importance of channel learning in bridging the gap. Building on these results,
our results lead to the following implications of multipath sparsity: 1) The
coherence requirements are shared in both time and frequency, thereby
significantly relaxing the required scaling in coherence time with SNR; 2)
Sparse multipath channels are asymptotically coherent -- for a given but large
bandwidth, the channel can be learned perfectly and the coherence requirements
for first- and second-order optimality met through sufficiently large signaling
duration; and 3) The requirement of peaky signals in attaining capacity is
eliminated or relaxed in sparse environments.
"
What are the two cosmological models used to model the universe's large scale structures with non-spherical symmetry?,"  We explore the effects of background cosmology on large scale structures with
non-spherical symmetry by using the concept of quasi-equilibrium which allows
certain internal properties (e.g. angular velocity) of the bodies to change
with time. In accordance with the discovery of the accelerated phase of the
universe we model the cosmological background by two representative models: the
$\Lambda$CDM Model and the Chaplygin Gas Model. We compare the effects of the
two models on various properties of large astrophysical objects. Different
equations of state are also invoked in the investigation.
"
What are the key concepts of the Netsukuku Domain Name Anarchy system?,"  We present the Abnormal Netsukuku Domain Name Anarchy system. ANDNA is the
distributed, non hierarchical and decentralised system of hostname management
used in the Netsukuku network.
"
"What is the role of bremsstrahlung, cyclotron, and blackbody source terms in the emergent photon spectrum?","  Accretion-powered X-ray pulsars are among the most luminous X-ray sources in
the Galaxy. However, despite decades of theoretical and observational work
since their discovery, no satisfactory model for the formation of the observed
X-ray spectra has emerged. In this paper, we report on a self-consistent
calculation of the spectrum emerging from a pulsar accretion column that
includes an explicit treatment of the bulk and thermal Comptonization occurring
in the radiation-dominated shocks that form in the accretion flows. Using a
rigorous eigenfunction expansion method, we obtain a closed-form expression for
the Green's function describing the upscattering of monochromatic radiation
injected into the column. The Green's function is convolved with
bremsstrahlung, cyclotron, and blackbody source terms to calculate the emergent
photon spectrum. We show that energization of photons in the shock naturally
produces an X-ray spectrum with a relatively flat continuum and a high-energy
exponential cutoff. Finally, we demonstrate that our model yields good
agreement with the spectra of the bright pulsar Her X-1 and the low luminosity
pulsar X Per.
"
What is the origin of neutrino emission from gamma-ray bursts?,"  The high energy neutrino emission from gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) has been
expected in various scenarios. In this paper, we study the neutrino emission
from early afterglows of GRBs, especially under the reverse-forward shock model
and late prompt emission model. In the former model, the early afterglow
emission occurs due to dissipation made by an external shock with the
circumburst medium (CBM). In the latter model, internal dissipation such as
internal shocks produces the shallow decay emission in early afterglows. We
also discuss implications of recent Swift observations for neutrino signals in
detail. Future neutrino detectors such as IceCube may detect neutrino signals
from early afterglows, especially under the late prompt emission model, while
the detection would be difficult under the reverse-forward shock model.
Contribution to the neutrino background from the early afterglow emission may
be at most comparable to that from the prompt emission unless the outflow
making the early afterglow emission loads more nonthermal protons, and it may
be important in the very high energies. Neutrino-detections are inviting
because they could provide us with not only information on baryon acceleration
but also one of the clues to the model of early afterglows. Finally, we compare
various predictions for the neutrino background from GRBs, which are testable
by future neutrino-observations.
"
What is the condition for the boundedness of maximal operators associated with smooth hypersurfaces in 3-dimensional Euclidean space?,"  We study the boundedness problem for maximal operators $\M$ associated to
smooth hypersurfaces $S$ in 3-dimensional Euclidean space. For $p>2,$ we prove
that if no affine tangent plane to $S$ passes through the origin and $S$ is
analytic, then the associated maximal operator is bounded on $L^p(\RR^3)$ if
and only if $p>h(S),$ where $h(S)$ denotes the so-called height of the surface
$S.$ For non-analytic finite type $S$ we obtain the same statement with the
exception of the exponent $p=h(S).$ Our notion of height $h(S)$ is closely
related to A. N. Varchenko's notion of height $h(\phi)$ for functions $\phi$
such that $S$ can be locally represented as the graph of $\phi$ after a
rotation of coordinates.
  Several consequences of this result are discussed. In particular we verify a
conjecture by E.M. Stein and its generalization by A. Iosevich and E. Sawyer on
the connection between the decay rate of the Fourier transform of the surface
measure on $S$ and the $L^p$-boundedness of the associated maximal operator
$\M$, and a conjecture by Iosevich and Sawyer which relates the
$L^p$-boundedness of $\M$ to an integrability condition on $S$ for the distance
function to tangential hyperplanes, in dimension three.
  In particular, we also give ess. sharp uniform estimates for the Fourier
transform of the surface measure on $S,$ thus extending a result by V.N.
Karpushkin from the analytic to the smooth setting and implicitly verifying a
conjecture by V.I. Arnol'd in our context.
"
What is the conformal technique used to solve the Cauchy problem of 3+1 general relativity?,"  This lecture is devoted to the problem of computing initial data for the
Cauchy problem of 3+1 general relativity. The main task is to solve the
constraint equations. The conformal technique, introduced by Lichnerowicz and
enhanced by York, is presented. Two standard methods, the conformal
transverse-traceless one and the conformal thin sandwich, are discussed and
illustrated by some simple examples. Finally a short review regarding initial
data for binary systems (black holes and neutron stars) is given.
"
What is the temperature dependence of charge order in Fe2O3 characterized by coexisting mobile and immobile carriers?,"  The temperature dependence of charge order in Fe2OBO3 was investigated by
resistivity and differential scanning calorimetry measurements, Mossbauer
spectroscopy, and synchrotron x-ray scattering, revealing an intermediate phase
between room temperature and 340 K, characterized by coexisting mobile and
immobile carriers, and by incommensurate superstructure modulations with
temperature-dependent propagation vector (1/2,0,tau). The incommensurate
modulations arise from specific anti-phase boundaries with low energy cost due
to geometrical charge frustration.
"
What is the relationship between the diffusion coefficient of a probe particle and the concentration of a polymer solution?,"  The experimental literature on the motion of mesoscopic probe particles
through polymer solutions is systematically reviewed. The primary focus is the
study of diffusive motion of small probe particles. Comparison is made with
measurements of solution viscosities. A coherent description was obtained,
namely that the probe diffusion coefficient generally depends on polymer
concentration as D_p = D_0 exp(-alpha c^nu). One finds that alpha depends on
polymer molecular weights as alpha ~ M^0.8, and \nu appears to have large-M and
small-M values with a crossover linking them. The probe diffusion coefficient
does not simply track the solution viscosity; instead, D_p eta typically
increases markedly with increasing polymer concentration and molecular weight.
In some systems, e.g., hydroxypropylcellulose:water, the observed probe spectra
are bi- or tri-modal. Extended analysis of the full probe phenomenology implies
that hydroxypropylcellulose solutions are characterized by a single,
concentration-independent, length scale that is approximately the size of a
polymer coil. In a very few systems, one sees re-entrant or
low-concentration-plateau behaviors of uncertain interpretation; from their
rarity, these behaviors are reasonably interpreted as corresponding to specific
chemical effects. True microrheological studies examining the motion of
mesoscopic particles under the influence of a known external force are also
examined. Viscosity from true microrheological measurements is in many cases
substantially smaller than the viscosity measured with a macroscopic
instrument.
"
What are the critical exponents of the specific heat and susceptibility for the two-component spinor Bose gas?,"  We investigate the low temperature behaviour of the integrable 1D
two-component spinor Bose gas using the thermodynamic Bethe ansatz. We find
that for strong coupling the characteristics of the thermodynamics at low
temperatures are quantitatively affected by the spin ferromagnetic states,
which are described by an effective ferromagnetic Heisenberg chain. The free
energy, specific heat, susceptibility and local pair correlation function are
calculated for various physical regimes in terms of temperature and interaction
strength. These thermodynamic properties reveal spin effects which are
significantly different than those of the spinless Bose gas. The zero-field
susceptibility for finite strong repulsion exceeds that of a free spin
paramagnet. The critical exponents of the specific heat $c_v \sim T^{1/2}$ and
the susceptibility $\chi \sim T^{-2}$ are indicative of the ferromagnetic
signature of the two-component spinor Bose gas. Our analytic results are
consistent with general arguments by Eisenberg and Lieb for polarized spinor
bosons.
"
What are the anisotropic metamaterials that magnify two-dimensional planar images beyond the diffraction limit?,"  The coordinate transformation technique is applied to the design of perfect
lenses and superlenses. In particular, anisotropic metamaterials that magnify
two-dimensional planar images beyond the diffraction limit are designed by the
use of oblate spheroidal coordinates. The oblate spheroidal perfect lens or
superlens can naturally be used in reverse for lithography of planar
subwavelength patterns.
"
What is the crossover between the chiral and diquark condensates in a color superconductor?,"  Using a general Ginzburg-Landau effective Lagrangian, we study the
topological structure and low-lying collective modes of dense QCD having both
chiral and diquark condensates, for two and three massless flavors. As we found
earlier, the QCD axial anomaly acts as an external field applied to the chiral
condensate in a color superconductor and, as a new critical point emerges,
leads to a crossover between the broken chiral symmetry and color
superconducting phases. At intermediate densities where both chiral and diquark
condensates are present, we derive a generalized Gell-Mann- Oakes-Renner
relation between the masses of pseudoscalar bosons and the magnitude of the
chiral and diquark-condensates. We show explicitly the continuity of the
ordinary pion at low densities to a generalized pion at high densities.
"
What are the results of the cosmic ray particle phase space distributions?,"  We present results of time evolution of oblique MHD plane shocks including
diffusive cosmic ray acceleration with backreaction on the plasma flows. The
simulations include self-consistent effects of finite Alfven wave propagation
and dissipation. From the computed cosmic ray particle phase space
distributions we calculate expected leptonic and hadronic emissions resulting
from interactions between the cosmic rays, magnetic fields, the thermal
particle population and relevant astrophysical photon fields.
"
What are the key findings of the experiments of hysteresis in phase transitions?,"  Models undergoing a phase transition to an absorbing state weakly broken by
the addition of a very low spontaneous nucleation rate are shown to exhibit
hysteresis loops whose width $\Delta\lambda$ depends algebraically on the ramp
rate $r$. Analytical arguments and numerical simulations show that
$\Delta\lambda \sim r^{\kappa}$ with $\kappa = 1/(\beta'+1)$, where $\beta'$ is
the critical exponent governing the survival probability of a seed near
threshold. These results explain similar hysteresis scaling observed before in
liquid crystal convection experiments. This phenomenon is conjectured to occur
in a variety of other experimental systems.
"
How were the precise relative positions of the triplet levels with respect to the singlet levels achieved in the spectroscopic data analysis?,"  We report on high resolution Fourier-transform spectroscopy of fluorescence
to the a^3\Sigma_u^+ state excited by two-photon or two-step excitation from
the X^1\Sigma_g^+ state to the 2^3\Pi_g state in the molecule K_2. These
spectroscopic data are combined with recent results of Feshbach resonances and
two-color photoassociation spectra for deriving the potential curves of
X^1\Sigma_g^+ and a^3\Sigma_u^+ up to the asymptote. The precise relative
position of the triplet levels with respect of the singlet levels was achieved
by including the excitation energies from the X^1\Sigma_g^+ state to the
2^3\Pi_g state and down to the a^3\Sigma_u^+ state in the simultaneous fit of
both potentials. The derived precise potential curves allow for reliable
modeling of cold collisions of pairs of potassium atoms in their ^2S ground
state.
"
What are the cryptographic exponent of the Jacobians of supersingular curves of genus 2 over a finite field?,"  We compute in a direct (not algorithmic) way the zeta function of all
supersingular curves of genus 2 over a finite field k, with many geometric
automorphisms. We display these computations in an appendix where we select a
family of representatives of all these curves up to geometric isomorphism and
we exhibit equations and the zeta function of all their twists. As an
application we obtain a direct computation of the cryptographic exponent of the
Jacobians of these curves.
"
What is the time complexity of the polynomial dynamic programming algorithm for the MRSO problem?,"  In this paper we consider the problem of computing an mRNA sequence of
maximal similarity for a given mRNA of secondary structure constraints,
introduced by Backofen et al. in [BNS02] denoted as the MRSO problem. The
problem is known to be NP-complete for planar associated implied structure
graphs of vertex degree at most 3. In [BFHV05] a first polynomial dynamic
programming algorithms for MRSO on implied structure graphs with maximum vertex
degree 3 of bounded cut-width is shown. We give a simple but more general
polynomial dynamic programming solution for the MRSO problem for associated
implied structure graphs of bounded clique-width. Our result implies that MRSO
is polynomial for graphs of bounded tree-width, co-graphs, $P_4$-sparse graphs,
and distance hereditary graphs. Further we conclude that the problem of
comparing two solutions for MRSO is hard for the class of problems which can be
solved in polynomial time with a number of parallel queries to an oracle in NP.
"
What are the classical solutions of the world-volume theory for non-BPS D(p+1)-brane?,"  We study properties of non-BPS D(p+1)-brane in the background of k
NS5-branes, with one transverse direction compactified on a circle, from the
point of view of Dirac-Born-Infeld action. We present the analysis of two
different embedding of non-BPS D(p+1)-brane in given background and study the
classical solutions of given world-volume theory. We argue for the
configuration of a non-BPS D(p+1)-brane which allows us to find solutions of
the equations of motion that give unified descriptions of G and U-type branes.
"
What are the chiral transformation properties of baryons with three quarks?,"  We study the chiral transformation properties of all possible local
(non-derivative) interpolating field operators for baryons consisting of three
quarks with two flavors, assuming good isospin symmetry. We derive and use the
relations/identities among the baryon operators with identical quantum numbers
that follow from the combined colour, Dirac and isospin Fierz transformations.
These relations reduce the number of independent baryon operators with any
given spin and isospin. The Fierz identities also effectively restrict allowed
baryon chiral multiplets. It turns out that the chiral multiplets of the
baryons are equivalent to their Lorentz representation. For the two independent
nucleon operators the only permissible chiral multiplet is the fundamental one
$(\frac12,0)\oplus(0,\frac12)$. For the $\Delta$, admissible Lorentz
representations are $(1,\frac12)\oplus (\frac12,1)$ and
$(\frac32,0)\oplus(0,\frac32)$. In the case of the $(1,\frac12)\oplus
(\frac12,1)$ chiral multiplet the $I(J)=\frac32(\frac32)$ $\Delta$ field has
one $I(J)=\frac12(\frac32)$ chiral partner; otherwise it has none. We also
consider the Abelian ($U_A(1)$) chiral transformation properties of fields and
show that each baryon comes in two varieties: 1) with Abelian axial charge +3;
and 2) with Abelian axial charge -1. In case of the nucleon these are the two
Ioffe's fields; in case of the $\Delta$, the $(1,\frac12)\oplus (\frac12,1)$
multiplet has Abelian axial charge -1 and the $(\frac32,0)\oplus(0,\frac32)$
multiplet has Abelian axial charge +3.
"
What are the new applications of quantum properties of light for sources?,"  Lasers and LEDs display a statistical distribution in the number of photons
emitted in a given time interval. New applications exploiting the quantum
properties of light require sources for which either individual photons, or
pairs, are generated in a regulated stream. Here we review recent research on
single-photon sources based on the emission of a single semiconductor quantum
dot. In just a few years remarkable progress has been made in generating
indistinguishable single-photons and entangled photon pairs using such
structures. It suggests it may be possible to realise compact, robust, LED-like
semiconductor devices for quantum light generation.
"
What is the explicit error due to the non-commutivity of the updating operators in Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithms?,"  We introduce a simple general method for finding the equilibrium distribution
for a class of widely used inexact Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithms. The
explicit error due to the non-commutivity of the updating operators when
numerically integrating Hamilton's equations can be derived using the
Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff formula. This error is manifest in the conservation of
a ``shadow'' Hamiltonian that lies close to the desired Hamiltonian. The fixed
point distribution of inexact Hybrid algorithms may then be derived taking into
account that the fixed point of the momentum heatbath and that of the molecular
dynamics do not coincide exactly. We perform this derivation for various
inexact algorithms used for lattice QCD calculations.
"
What are the classical contraction parameters in the commutation relations of the contracted Lie algebras?,"  We present a systematic procedure to obtain singular solutions of the
constant quantum Yang-Baxter equation in arbitrary dimension. This approach,
inspired in the Lie (super)algebra structure, is explicitly applied to the
particular case of (graded) contractions of the orthogonal real algebra
${\mathfrak{so}}(N+1)$. In this way we show that ""classical"" contraction
parameters which appear in the commutation relations of the contracted Lie
algebras, become quantum deformation parameters, arising as entries of the
resulting quantum $R$-matrices.
"
What are the different master equations analyzed in view of the related symmetry group?,"  The general formalism of quantum mechanics for the description of statistical
experiments is briefly reviewed, introducing in particular position and
momentum observables as POVM characterized by their covariance properties with
respect to the isochronous Galilei group. Mappings describing state
transformations both as a consequence of measurement and of dynamical evolution
for a closed or open system are considered with respect to the general
constraints they have to obey and their covariance properties with respect to
symmetry groups. In particular different master equations are analyzed in view
of the related symmetry group, recalling the general structure of mappings
covariant under the same group. This is done for damped harmonic oscillator,
two-level system and quantum Brownian motion. Special attention is devoted to
the general structure of translation-covariant master equations. Within this
framework a recently obtained quantum counterpart of the classical linear
Boltzmann equation is considered, as well as a general theoretical framework
for the description of different decoherence experiments, pointing to a
connection between different possible behaviours in the description of
decoherence and the characteristic functions of classical L\'evy processes.
"
What is the polarization-entangled photons used in the depolarization process?,"  We employed an electrically-driven polarization controller to implement
anisotropic depolarizing quantum channels for the polarization state of single
photons. The channels were characterized by means of ancilla-assisted quantum
process tomography using polarization-entangled photons generated in the
process of spontaneous parametric down-conversion. The demonstrated
depolarization method offers good repeatability, low cost, and compatibility
with fiber-optic setups. It does not perturb the modal structure of single
photons, and therefore can be used to verify experimentally protocols for
managing decoherence effects based on multiphoton interference.
"
What is the algebraic theory of infinite classical lattices?,"  This is the third in a series of papers dealing with the algebraic theory of
infinite classical lattices. This paper presents a theory of single
measurements on a lattice which we represent as comprising a finite
subvolume--the system of measurement--immersed in an infinite surround or
``heat bath'' which determines the system's state. We consider the class of all
stationary distributions on the set of microcanonical states of the infinite
lattice. The theory addresses the question, ``For a lattice initially in state
A, say, what is the probability that measurement of a certain quantity will
take a value in (a,b)?'' Discussion includes description of the source of
randomness in a measurement as well as characterization of the given states A.
"
What are the detailed solutions to many of the octal games discussed in the paper?,"  We provide supplementary appendices to the paper Misere quotients for
impartial games. These include detailed solutions to many of the octal games
discussed in the paper, and descriptions of the algorithms used to compute most
of our solutions.
"
What is the significance of the polynomial time algorithm in relation to the factorization of RSA moduli?,"  In this article, we give evidence that computing Fourier coefficients of the
Hecke eigenforms for composite indices is no easier than factoring integers. In
particular, we show that the existence of a polynomial time algorithm that,
given n, computes the n-th Fourier coefficient of a (fixed) Hecke eigenform
implies that we can factor most RSA moduli (numbers that are products of two
distinct primes) in polynomial time.
"
How are CFOs in a MIMO system estimated using blind CFO estimation and symbol recovery?,"  Multiple carrier-frequency offsets (CFO) arise in a distributed antenna
system, where data are transmitted simultaneously from multiple antennas. In
such systems the received signal contains multiple CFOs due to mismatch between
the local oscillators of transmitters and receiver. This results in a
time-varying rotation of the data constellation, which needs to be compensated
for at the receiver before symbol recovery. This paper proposes a new approach
for blind CFO estimation and symbol recovery. The received base-band signal is
over-sampled, and its polyphase components are used to formulate a virtual
Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) problem. By applying blind MIMO system
estimation techniques, the system response is estimated and used to
subsequently transform the multiple CFOs estimation problem into many
independent single CFO estimation problems. Furthermore, an initial estimate of
the CFO is obtained from the phase of the MIMO system response. The Cramer-Rao
Lower bound is also derived, and the large sample performance of the proposed
estimator is compared to the bound.
"
What is the behavior of the magnetization of the Ising model after a sudden quench?,"  We study numerically the nonequilibrium dynamical behavior of an Ising model
with mixed two-spin and four-spin interactions after a sudden quench from the
high-temperature phase to the first-order phase transition point. The
autocorrelation function is shown to approach its limiting value, given by the
magnetization in the ordered phase at the transition point, m_c, through a
stretched exponential decay. On the other hand relaxation of the magnetization
starting with an uncorrelated initial state with magnetization, m_i, approaches
either m_c, for m_i>0.5, or zero, for m_i<0.5. For small m_i and for m_i
slightly larger than 0.5 the relaxation of the magnetization shows an
asymptotic power-law time dependence, thus from a nonequilibrium point of view
the transition is continuous.
"
What is a level algebra and how is it defined in the context of polynomial rings?,"  Let $R=k[x_1,..., x_r]$ be the polynomial ring in $r$ variables over an
infinite field $k$, and let $M$ be the maximal ideal of $R$. Here a \emph{level
algebra} will be a graded Artinian quotient $A$ of $R$ having socle
$Soc(A)=0:M$ in a single degree $j$. The Hilbert function $H(A)=(h_0,h_1,...
,h_j)$ gives the dimension $h_i=\dim_k A_i$ of each degree-$i$ graded piece of
$A$ for $0\le i\le j$. The embedding dimension of $A$ is $h_1$, and the
\emph{type} of $A$ is $\dim_k \Soc (A)$, here $h_j$. The family $\Levalg (H)$
of level algebra quotients of $R$ having Hilbert function $H$ forms an open
subscheme of the family of graded algebras or, via Macaulay duality, of a
Grassmannian.
  We show that for each of the Hilbert functions $H=H_1=(1,3,4,4)$ and
$H=H_2=(1,3,6,8,9,3)$ the family $LevAlg (H)$ parametrizing level Artinian
algebras of Hilbert function $H$ has several irreducible components. We show
also that these examples each lift to points. However, in the first example, an
irreducible Betti stratum for Artinian algebras becomes reducible when lifted
to points. These were the first examples we obtained of multiple components for
$\Levalg(H)$ in embedding dimension three.
  We also show that the second example is the first in an infinite sequence of
examples of type three Hilbert functions $H(c)$ in which also the number of
components of LevAlg(H) gets arbitrarily large.
  The first case where the phenomenon of multiple components can occur (i.e.
the lowest embedding dimension and then the lowest type) is that of dimension
three and type two. Examples of this first case have been obtained by the
authors and also by J.-O. Kleppe.
"
What are the implications of the anti-correlation between the BSS frequency and the galaxy Mv for understanding the nature of BSS in dwarf galaxies?,"  Abridged... Blue stragglers (BSS) are thought to be the product of either
primordial or collisional binary systems. In the context of dwarf spheroidal
galaxies it is hard to firmly disentangle a genuine BSS population from young
main sequence (MS) stars tracing a ~1-2 Gyr old star forming episode. Assuming
that their blue plume populations are made of BSS, we estimate the BSS
frequency for 8 Local Group non star-forming dwarf galaxies, using a
compilation of ground and space based photometry.
  Our results can be summarized as follows: (i) The BSS frequency in dwarf
galaxies, at any given Mv, is always higher than that in globular clusters of
similar luminosities; (ii) the BSS frequency for the lowest luminosity dwarf
galaxies is in excellent agreement with that observed in the Milky Way halo;
and most interestingly (iii) derive a statistically significant
anti-correlation between the BSS frequency and the galaxy Mv.
  The low density, almost collision-less, environments of our dwarf galaxy
sample allow us to infer (i) their very low dynamical evolution; (ii) a
negligible production of collisional BSS; and consequently (iii) that their
blue plumes are mainly made of primordial binaries. The dwarf galaxies
anti-correlation can be used as a discriminator: galaxies obeying the
anti-correlation are more likely to possess genuine primordial BSS rather than
young main sequence stars.
"
What are the key concepts of the stabilizer formalism used to construct the minimal code?,"  Using the stabilizer formalism we construct the minimal code into a
D-dimensional Hilbert space (qudit) to protect a qubit against phase damping.
The effectiveness of this code is then studied by means of input-output
fidelity.
"
What is the relationship between the pressure of tilings and the smoothness of tilings?,"  We consider tiles of some fixed size, with an associated weighting on the
shapes of tile, of total mass 1. We study the pressure, $p$, of tilings with
those tiles; the pressure, one over the volume times the logarithm of the
partition function. (The quantity we define as ""pressure"" could, perhaps
equally harmoniously with physics notation, be called ""entropy per volume"",
neither nomenclature is ""correct"".) We let $\hat p^0$ (easy to compute) be the
pressure in the limit of absolute smoothness (the weighting function is
constant). Then as smoothness, suitably defined, increases, $p$ converges to
$\hat p^0$, uniformly in the volume. It is the uniformity requirement that
makes the result non-trivial. This seems like a very basic result in the theory
of pressure of tilings. Though at the same time, perhaps non-glamorous, being
bereft of geometry and not very difficult. The problem arose for us out of
study of a problem in mathematical physics, associated to a model of
ferromagnetism.
"
What is the purpose of the achromatic four-quadrant phase mask stellar coronagraph?,"  CONTEXT: The four-quadrant phase mask stellar coronagraph, introduced by D.
Rouan et al., is capable of achieving very high dynamical range imaging and was
studied in the context of the direct detection of extra-solar planets.
Achromatic four-quadrant phase mask is currently being developed for broadband
IR applications. AIMS: We report on laboratory and on-sky tests of a prototype
coronagraph in the visible. This prototype, the achromatic hybrid phase knife
coronagraph, was derived from the four-quadrant phase mask principle. METHODS:
The instrumental setup implementing the coronagraph itself was designed to
record the pre- and post-coronagraphic images simultaneously so that an
efficient real-time image selection procedure can be performed. We describe the
coronagraph and the associated tools that enable robust and repeatable
observations. We present an algorithm of image selection that has been tested
against the real on-sky data of the binary star HD80081 (* 38 Lyn). RESULTS
Although the observing conditions were poor, the efficiency of the proposed
method is proven. From this experiment, we derive procedures that can apply to
future focal instruments associating adaptive optics and coronagraphy,
targeting high dynamic range imaging in astronomy, such as detecting
extra-solar planets.
"
"How can charged matter be geometrically engineered by the deformation of ADE-type orbifold singularities in type IIa, M-theory, and F-theory compactifications?","  Katz and Vafa showed how charged matter can arise geometrically by the
deformation of ADE-type orbifold singularities in type IIa, M-theory, and
F-theory compactifications. In this paper we use those same basic ingredients,
used there to geometrically engineer specific matter representations, here to
deform the compactification manifold itself in a way which naturally
compliments many features of unified model building. We realize this idea
explicitly by deforming a manifold engineered to give rise to an $SU_5$ grand
unified model into a one giving rise to the Standard Model. In this framework,
the relative local positions of the singularities giving rise to Standard Model
fields are specified in terms of the values of a small number of complex
structure moduli which deform the original manifold, greatly reducing the
arbitrariness of their relative positions.
"
What is the NN FSI effect in the reaction K^+d->K^+pn?,"  The Kd reactions are considered in the impulse approximation with NN
final-state interactions (NN FSI) taken into account. The realistic parameters
for the KN phase shifts are used. The ""quasi-elastic"" energy region, in which
the elementary KN interaction is predominantly elastic, is considered. The
theoretical predictions are compared with the data on the K^+d->K^+pn,
K^+d->K^0pp, K^+d->K^+d and K^+d total cross sections. The NN FSI effect in the
reaction K^+d->K^+pn has been found to be large. The predictions for the Kd
cross sections are also given for slow kaons, produced from phi(1020) decays,
as the functions of the isoscalar KN scattering length a_0. These predictions
can be used to extract the value of a_0 from the data.
"
What is the Weyl's function used to reconstruct a CMV matrix from its spectra?,"  For finite dimensional CMV matrices the classical inverse spectral problems
are considered. We solve the inverse problem of reconstructing a CMV matrix by
its Weyl's function, the problem of reconstructing the matrix by two spectra of
CMV matrices with different ""boundary conditions"", and the problem of
reconstructing the CMV matrix by its spectrum and the spectrum of the CMV
matrix obtained from it by truncation.
"
What is the role of the second class constraints in the covariant BRST quantization?,"  To exhibit the possible origin of the inner complexity of the Berkovits's
pure spinor approach, we consider the covariant BRST quantization of the D=11
massless superparticle (M0-brane) in its spinor moving frame or twistor-like
Lorentz harmonics formulation. The presence of additional twistor-like
variables (spinor harmonics) allows us to separate covariantly the first and
the second class constraints. After taking into account the second class
constraints by means of Dirac brackets and after further reducing the first
class constraints algebra, the dynamical system is described by the cohomology
of a simple BRST charge associated to the d=1, n=16 supersymmetry algebra. The
calculation of the cohomology of this BRST operator requires a regularization
which implies the complexification of the bosonic ghost associated to the
kappa-symmetry and further leads to a complex (non-Hermitian) BRST charge which
is essentially the `pure spinor' BRST operator by Berkovits, but with a
composite pure spinor.
"
What are the relative probabilities of electric and magnetic dipole transitions?,"  We study the branching ratios of the allowed and forbidden radiative
transitions among the first few (9) fine structure levels of O VI using
relativistic coupled cluster theory. We find irregular patterns for a number of
transitions with in $n$-complexes with $n\le4$. We have used the exisiting
values of the allowed electric dipole ($E1$) transition as a benchmark of our
theory. Good agreement with the existing values establish accuracies of not
only the theoretical method but the basis function as well. In general the
electric quadrupole ($E2$) transition probabilities are greater in magnitude
than magnetic dipole ($M1$) transition probabilities, whereas for medium atomic
transition frequencies they are of the same order of magnitude. On the other
hand if the transitions involved are between two fine structure components of
the same term, then the $M1$ transition probability is more probable than that
of $E2$. We have analyzed these trends with physical arguments and order of
magnitude estimations. The results presented here in tabular and graphical
forms are compared with the available theoretical and observed data. Graphical
analysis helps to understand the trends of electric and magnetic transitions
for the decay channels presented here. Our calculated values of the lifetimes
of the excited states are in very good agreement with the available results.
"
What are the Lorentzian-shaped current-voltage curves for resonant-tunneling field emission from three-dimensional substrates and two-dimensional accumulation layers?,"  We have performed theoretical and experimental studies of field emission from
nanostructured semiconductor cathodes. Resonant tunneling through
electric-field-induced interface bound states is found to strongly affect the
field-emission characteristics. Our analytical theory predicts power-law and
Lorentzian-shaped current-voltage curves for resonant-tunneling field emission
from three-dimensional substrates and two-dimensional accumulation layers,
respectively. These predicted line shapes are observed in field emission
characteristics from self-assembled silicon nanostructures. A simple model
describes formation of an accumulation layer and of the resonant level in these
systems.
"
What is the phenomenon of flexoelectricity in centrosymmetric crystals?,"  Piezoelectricity is inherent only in noncentrosymmetric materials, but a
piezoelectric response can also be obtained in centrosymmetric crystals if
subjected to inhomogeneous deformation. This phenomenon, known as
flexoelectricity, affects the functional properties of insulators, particularly
thin films of high permittivity materials. We have measured
strain-gradient-induced polarization in single crystals of paraelectric
SrTiO$_3$ as a function of temperature and orientation down to and below the
105 K phase transition. Estimates were obtained for all the components of the
flexoelectric tensor, and calculations based on these indicate that local
polarization around defects in SrTiO$_3$ may exceed the largest ferroelectric
polarizations. A sign reversal of the flexoelectric response detected below the
phase transition suggests that the ferroelastic domain walls of SrTiO$_3$ may
be polar.
"
What is the relationship between the energy gap in the DOS and electron pairing in superconductors?,"  Pairing of electrons in conventional superconductors occurs at the
superconducting transition temperature Tc, creating an energy gap D in the
electronic density of states (DOS). In the high-Tc superconductors, a partial
gap in the DOS exists for a range of temperatures above Tc. A key question is
whether the gap in the DOS above Tc is associated with pairing, and what
determines the temperature at which incoherent pairs form. Here we report the
first spatially resolved measurements of gap formation in a high-Tc
superconductor, measured on Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+d samples with different Tc values
(hole concentration of 0.12 to 0.22) using scanning tunnelling microscopy. Over
a wide range of doping from 0.16 to 0.22 we find that pairing gaps nucleate in
nanoscale regions above Tc. These regions proliferate as the temperature is
lowered, resulting in a spatial distribution of gap sizes in the
superconducting state. Despite the inhomogeneity, we find that every pairing
gap develops locally at a temperature Tp, following the relation 2D/kBTp = 8.
At very low doping (<0.14), systematic changes in the DOS indicate the presence
of another phenomenon, which is unrelated and perhaps competes with electron
pairing. Our observation of nanometre-sized pairing regions provides the
missing microscopic basis for understanding recent reports of fluctuating
superconducting response above Tc in hole-doped high-Tc copper oxide
superconductors.
"
Can maximally entangled states remain the most entangled ones after a unilocal noise channel?,"  A set of all states of a bi-partite quantum system can be divided into
subsets each of which contains states with the same degree of entanglement. In
this paper we address a question whether local operations (without classical
communication) affect the entanglement-induced state ordering. We show that
arbitrary unilocal channel (i.e., a channel that acts on one sub-system of a
bi-partite system only) might change the ordering for an arbitrary nontrivial
measure of entanglement. A slightly weaker result holds for the maximally
entangled states. In particular, the maximally entangled states might not
remain the most entangled ones at the output of a unilocal noise channel.
"
What is the Eisenbud-Griffith theorem for a subcoalgebra?,"  We study serial coalgebras by means of their valued Gabriel quivers. In
particular, Hom-computable and representation-directed coalgebras are
characterized. The Auslander-Reiten quiver of a serial coalgebra is described.
Finally, a version of Eisenbud-Griffith theorem is proved, namely, every
subcoalgebra of a prime, hereditary and strictly quasi-finite coalgebra is
serial.
"
What are the implications of the phase transition in many-body systems?,"  Four-body interaction plays an important role in many-body systems, and it
can exhibit interesting phase transition behaviors. Historically it was the
need to efficiently simulate quantum systems that lead the idea of a quantum
computer. In this Letter, we report the experimental demonstration of a
four-body interaction in a four- qubit nuclear magnetic resonance quantum
information processor. The strongly modulating pulse is used to implement spin
selective excitation. The results show a good agreement between theory and
experiment.
"
What are the indices of the elementary subfactors of a non-commuting quadrilateral of factors?,"  A quadrilateral of factors is an irreducible inclusion of factors $N \subset
M$ with intermediate subfactors $P$ and $Q$ such that $P$ and $Q$ generate $M$
and the intersection of $P$ and $Q$ is $N$. We investigate the structure of a
non-commuting quadrilateral of factors with all the elementary inclusions
$P\subset M$, $Q\subset M$, $N\subset P$, and $N\subset Q$ 2-supertransitive.
In particular we classify such quadrilaterals with the indices of the
elementary subfactors less than or equal to 4. We also compute the angles
between $P$ and $Q$ for quadrilaterals coming from $\alpha$-induction and
asymptotic inclusions.
"
What is the new model for studying mobile entities in networks subject to transient faults?,"  Self-stabilization is a versatile technique to withstand any transient fault
in a distributed system. Mobile robots (or agents) are one of the emerging
trends in distributed computing as they mimic autonomous biologic entities. The
contribution of this paper is threefold. First, we present a new model for
studying mobile entities in networks subject to transient faults. Our model
differs from the classical robot model because robots have constraints about
the paths they are allowed to follow, and from the classical agent model
because the number of agents remains fixed throughout the execution of the
protocol. Second, in this model, we study the possibility of designing
self-stabilizing algorithms when those algorithms are run by mobile robots (or
agents) evolving on a graph. We concentrate on the core building blocks of
robot and agents problems: naming and leader election. Not surprisingly, when
no constraints are given on the network graph topology and local execution
model, both problems are impossible to solve. Finally, using minimal hypothesis
with respect to impossibility results, we provide deterministic and
probabilistic solutions to both problems, and show equivalence of these
problems by an algorithmic reduction mechanism.
"
What are the applications of Morita $\alpha$-contexts to $\ast$-modules?,"  This paper is an exposition of the so-called injective Morita contexts (in
which the connecting bimodule morphisms are injective) and Morita
$\alpha$contexts (in which the connecting bimodules enjoy some local
projectivity in the sense of Zimmermann-Huisgen). Motivated by situations in
which only one trace ideal is in action, or the compatibility between the
bimodule morphisms is not needed, we introduce the notions of Morita
semi-contexts and Morita data, and investigate them. Injective Morita data will
be used (with the help of static and adstatic modules) to establish
equivalences between some intersecting subcategories related to subcategories
of modules that are localized or colocalized by trace ideals of a Morita datum.
We end up with applications of Morita $\alpha$-contexts to $\ast$-modules and
injective right wide Morita contexts.
"
What is the Kepler satellite's role in discovering substellar companions to solar-type stars?,"  Hundreds of substellar companions to solar-type stars will be discovered with
the Kepler satellite. Kepler's extreme photometric precision gives access to
low-amplitude stellar variability contributed by a variety of physical
processes. We discuss in detail the periodic flux modulations arising from the
tidal force on the star due to a substellar companion. An analytic expression
for the variability is derived in the equilibrium-tide approximation. We
demonstrate analytically and through numerical solutions of the linear,
nonadiabatic stellar oscillation equations that the equilibrium-tide formula
works extremely well for stars of mass <1.4 Msun with thick surface convection
zones. More massive stars with largely radiative envelopes do not conform to
the equilibrium-tide approximation and can exhibit flux variations $\ga$10
times larger than naive estimates. Over the full range of stellar masses
considered, we treat the oscillatory response of the convection zone by
adapting a prescription that A. J. Brickhill developed for pulsating white
dwarfs. Compared to other sources of periodic variability, the ellipsoidal
lightcurve has a distinct dependence on time and system parameters. We suggest
that ellipsoidal oscillations induced by giant planets may be detectable from
as many as ~100 of the 10^5 Kepler target stars. (Abridged)
"
What is the simplified representation of the pion mass in terms of the minimal set of master integrals?,"  We derive a simplified representation for the pion mass to two loops in
three-flavour chiral perturbation theory. For this purpose, we first determine
the reduced expressions for the tensorial two-loop 2-point sunset integrals
arising in chiral perturbation theory calculations. Making use of those
relations, we obtain the expression for the pion mass in terms of the minimal
set of master integrals. On the basis of known results for these, we arrive at
an explicit analytic representation, up to the contribution from K-K-eta
intermediate states where a closed-form expression for the corresponding sunset
integral is missing. However, the expansion of this function for a small pion
mass leads to a simple representation which yields a very accurate
approximation of this contribution. Finally, we also give a discussion of the
numerical implications of our results.
"
What are the interacting classical random fields constructed using deformed *-algebras?,"  A class of interacting classical random fields is constructed using deformed
*-algebras of creation and annihilation operators. The fields constructed are
classical random field versions of ""Lie fields"". A vacuum vector is used to
construct linear forms over the algebras, which are conjectured to be states
over the algebras. Assuming this conjecture is true, the fields constructed are
""quantum random fields"" in the sense that they have Poincare invariant vacua
with a fluctuation scale determined by Planck's constant. A nonlocal particle
interpretation of the formalism is shown to be the same as a particle
interpretation of a quantum field theory.
"
What are the Grand-Unified theories?,"  If new physics is called upon to explain away fine tunings, like the
hierarchy problem, then, we argue, the principle of Minimal Flavor Violation is
inescapable. We review the principle and recent extensions to the lepton sector
and to Grand-Unified theories.
"
What are the cross-couplings among massless spin-two fields in the presence of a Dirac field?,"  The cross-couplings among several massless spin-two fields (described in the
free limit by a sum of Pauli-Fierz actions) in the presence of a Dirac field
are investigated in the framework of the deformation theory based on local BRST
cohomology. Under the hypotheses of locality, smoothness of the interactions in
the coupling constant, Poincare invariance, (background) Lorentz invariance and
the preservation of the number of derivatives on each field, we prove that
there are no consistent cross-interactions among different gravitons in the
presence of a Dirac field. The basic features of the couplings between a single
Pauli-Fierz field and a Dirac field are also emphasized.
"
What are the implications of the formula for the distribution of the first exit time of Brownian motion from the alcove of an affine Weyl group for Markov processes?,"  We obtain a formula for the distribution of the first exit time of Brownian
motion from the alcove of an affine Weyl group. In most cases the formula is
expressed compactly, in terms of Pfaffians. Expected exit times are derived in
the type \~A case. The results extend to other Markov processes. We also give
formulas for the real eigenfunctions of the Dirichlet and Neumann Laplacians on
alcoves, observing that the `Hot Spots' conjecture of J. Rauch is true for
alcoves.
"
What is the proof of the quasi-isometric rigidity of Sol and the lamplighter groups?,"  In this paper, which is the continuation of [EFW2], we complete the proof of
the quasi-isometric rigidity of Sol and the lamplighter groups. The results
were announced in [EFW1].
"
Do SIC-sets exist in arbitrary finite dimension?,"  Since Renes et al. [J. Math. Phys. 45, 2171 (2004)], there has been much
effort in the quantum information community to prove (or disprove) the
existence of symmetric informationally complete (SIC) sets of quantum states in
arbitrary finite dimension. This paper strengthens the urgency of this question
by showing that if SIC-sets exist: 1) by a natural measure of orthonormality,
they are as close to being an orthonormal basis for the space of density
operators as possible, and 2) in prime dimensions, the standard construction
for complete sets of mutually unbiased bases and Weyl-Heisenberg covariant
SIC-sets are intimately related: The latter represent minimum uncertainty
states for the former in the sense of Wootters and Sussman. Finally, we
contribute to the question of existence by conjecturing a quadratic redundancy
in the equations for Weyl-Heisenberg SIC-sets.
"
What are the implications of the global polarization of quarks and anti-quarks for the spin alignment of vector mesons?,"  Due to the presence of a large orbital angular momentum of the parton system
produced at the early stage of non-central heavy-ion collisions, quarks and
anti-quarks are shown to be polarized in the direction opposite to the reaction
plane which is determined by the impact-parameter and the beam momentum. The
global quark polarization via elastic scattering was first calculated in an
effective static potential model, then using QCD at finite temperature with the
hard-thermal-loop re-summed gluon propagator. The measurable consequences are
discussed. Global hyperon polarization from the hadronization of polarized
quarks are predicted independent of the hadronization scenarios. It has also
been shown that the global polarization of quarks and anti-quarks leads also to
spin alignment of vector mesons. Dedicated measurements at RHIC are underway
and some of the preliminary results are obtained. In this presentation, the
basic idea and main results of global quark polarization are presented. The
direct consequences such as global hyperon polarization and spin alignment are
summarized.
"
What is the equation of motion and Green's function method used to study strongly correlated electronic systems?,"  We present the Composite Operator Method (COM) as a modern approach to the
study of strongly correlated electronic systems, based on the equation of
motion and Green's function method. COM uses propagators of composite operators
as building blocks at the basis of approximate calculations and algebra
constrains to fix the representation of Green's functions in order to maintain
the algebraic and symmetry properties.
"
What is the estimated fraction of post common envelope binaries (PCEBs) among the WDMS in the SDSS database?,"  We present a detailed analysis of 101 white dwarf-main sequence binaries
(WDMS) from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) for which multiple SDSS spectra
are available. We detect significant radial velocity variations in 18 WDMS,
identifying them as post common envelope binaries (PCEBs) or strong PCEB
candidates. Strict upper limits to the orbital periods are calculated, ranging
from 0.43 to 7880 d. Given the sparse temporal sampling and relatively low
spectral resolution of the SDSS spectra, our results imply a PCEB fraction of
>=15% among the WDMS in the SDSS data base. Using a spectral
decomposition/fitting technique we determined the white dwarf effective
temperatures and surface gravities, masses, and secondary star spectral types
for all WDMS in our sample. Two independent distance estimates are obtained
from the flux scaling factors between the WDMS spectra, and the white dwarf
models and main sequence star templates, respectively. Approximately one third
of the systems in our sample show a significant discrepancy between the two
distance estimates. In the majority of discrepant cases, the distance estimate
based on the secondary star is too large. A possible explanation for this
behaviour is that the secondary star spectral types that we determined from the
SDSS spectra are systematically too early by 1-2 spectral classes. This
behaviour could be explained by stellar activity, if covering a significant
fraction of the star by cool dark spots will raise the temperature of the
inter-spot regions. Finally, we discuss the selection effects of the WDMS
sample provided by the SDSS project.
"
What is the result of a search for a narrow resonance in electron-positron events in the invariant mass range of 150-950 GeV/c^2?,"  We report the results of a search for a narrow resonance in electron-positron
events in the invariant mass range of 150-950 GeV/c^2 using 1.3 fb^-1 of ppbar
collision data at sqrt(s) = 1.96 TeV collected by the CDF II detector at
Fermilab. No significant evidence of such a resonance is observed and we
interpret the results to exclude the standard model-like Z' with a mass below
923 GeV/c^2 and the Randall-Sundrum graviton with a mass below 807 GeV/c^2 for
k/M_pl=0.1, both at the 95% confidence level. Combining with di-photon data
excludes the Randall-Sundrum graviton for masses below 889 GeV/c^2 for
k/M_pl=0.1.
"
What are the characteristics of the molecular gas detected in the Cederblad 110 region?,"  We present results of submillimeter observations of a low-mass young stellar
objects (YSOs) condensation in the Cederblad 110 region of the Chamaeleon I
dark cloud with Atacama Submillimeter Telescope Experiment. Our HCO+(J=4-3) map
reveals a dense molecular gas with an extent of ~ 0.1 pc, which is a complex of
two envelopes associated with class I sources Ced110 IRS4 and IRS11 and a very
young object Cha-MMS1. The other two class I sources in this region, IRS6 and
NIR89, are located outside the clump and have no extended HCO+ emission. HCO+
abundance is calculated to be 2.6 x 10^{-10} for MMS1 and 3.4 x 10^{-9} for
IRS4, which are comparable to the reported value for other young sources.
Bipolar outflows from IRS4 and IRS6 are detected in our 12CO(J=3-2) map. The
outflow from IRS4 seems to collide with Cha-MMS1. The outflow has enough
momentum to affect gas motion in MMS1, although no sign has been detected to
indicate that a triggered star formation has occurred.
"
How is the semi-empirical model of the magnetometer used to describe the magnetic resonance spectra?,"  We present an experimental study of the intrinsic magnetometric sensitivity
of an optical/rf-frequency double resonance magnetometer in which linearly
polarized laser light is used in the optical pumping and detection processes.
We show that a semi-empirical model of the magnetometer can be used to describe
the magnetic resonance spectra. Then, we present an efficient method to predict
the optimum operating point of the magnetometer, i.e., the light power and rf
Rabi frequency providing maximum magnetometric sensitivity. Finally, we apply
the method to investigate the evolution of the optimum operating point with
temperature. The method is very efficient to determine relaxation rates and
thus allowed us to determine the three collisional disalignment cross sections
for the components of the alignment tensor. Both first and second harmonic
signals from the magnetometer are considered and compared.
"
What are the key components of the Linguistic Annotation Framework?,"  This paper describes the Linguistic Annotation Framework under development
within ISO TC37 SC4 WG1. The Linguistic Annotation Framework is intended to
serve as a basis for harmonizing existing language resources as well as
developing new ones.
"
What are the boundary conditions of the $\tau$-function?,"  A spectral average which generalises the local spacing distribution of the
eigenvalues of random $ N\times N $ hermitian matrices in the bulk of their
spectrum as $ N\to\infty $ is known to be a $\tau$-function of the fifth
Painlev\'e system. This $\tau$-function, $ \tau(s) $, has generic parameters
and is transcendental but is characterised by particular boundary conditions
about the singular point $s=0$, which we determine here. When the average
reduces to the local spacing distribution we find that $\tau$-function is of
the separatrix, or partially truncated type.
"
What is the method for finding a resonance pole in the complex energy plane?,"  The resonant state of the open quantum system is studied from the viewpoint
of the outgoing momentum flux. We show that the number of particles is
conserved for a resonant state, if we use an expanding volume of integration in
order to take account of the outgoing momentum flux; the number of particles
would decay exponentially in a fixed volume of integration. Moreover, we
introduce new numerical methods of treating the resonant state with the use of
the effective potential. We first give a numerical method of finding a
resonance pole in the complex energy plane. The method seeks an energy
eigenvalue iteratively. We found that our method leads to a super-convergence,
the convergence exponential with respect to the iteration step. The present
method is completely independent of commonly used complex scaling. We also give
a numerical trick for computing the time evolution of the resonant state in a
limited spatial area. Since the wave function of the resonant state is
diverging away from the scattering potential, it has been previously difficult
to follow its time evolution numerically in a finite area.
"
What is the Milnor-Turaev torsion used to relate to the equivariant case?,"  We extend the main result in the previous paper of Zhang and the author
relating the Milnor-Turaev torsion with the complex valued analytic torsion to
the equivariant case.
"
What is the stellar population spectra observed at high resolution and with variable alpha-elements enhancements?,"  We built modelled spectra of stellar population at high resolution and with
variable alpha-elements enhancements. Analysing spectra of Galactic globular
clusters we show that it is possible to derive reliably and efficiently [Mg/Fe]
using spectra integrated along the line-of-sight. These detailed measurements
open perspectives for investigating the enrichment process on galaxies and star
clusters.
"
What are the two dualities of Feller's branching diffusion with logistic growth?,"  We derive a unified stochastic picture for the duality of a
resampling-selection model with a branching-coalescing particle process (cf.
http://www.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=MR2123250) and for the self-duality of
Feller's branching diffusion with logistic growth (cf. math/0509612). The two
dual processes are approximated by particle processes which are forward and
backward processes in a graphical representation. We identify duality relations
between the basic building blocks of the particle processes which lead to the
two dualities mentioned above.
"
What are the implications of the Lebesgue measure for the Feigenbaum operator?,"  We consider fixed points of the Feigenbaum (periodic-doubling) operator whose
orders tend to infinity. It is known that the hyperbolic dimension of their
Julia sets go to 2. We prove that the Lebesgue measure of these Julia sets tend
to zero. An important part of the proof consists in applying martingale theory
to a stochastic process with non-integrable increments.
"
What is the relation of the Poisson structures to classical invariant theory?,"  We classify in this paper Poisson structures on modules over semisimple Lie
algebras arising from classical r-matrices. We then study their quantizations
and the relation to classical invariant theory.
"
What is the novel method used to fit extended multiple images in the mass reconstruction of the cluster RCS0224-0002?,"  We present a detailed mass reconstruction of the cluster RCS0224-0002 at
$z=0.773$ from the strong lensing features observed with HST/WFPC2. The mass
profile is reconstructed using a parametric approach. We introduce a novel
method to fit extended multiple images based on the Modified Hausdorff Distance
between observed arcs and the arcs reproduced by the model. We perform the
detailed error analysis of the model parameter using the MCMC method. Our model
reproduces all the observed strong lensing features of the RCS0224-0002 and
predicts the redshift of one of the arcs systems to be $z\approx 2.65$ (the
other system has an spectroscopic redshift of $z=4.87$). The reconstructed
inner mass profile is well fitted by a non-singular isothermal sphere, rather
than with an NFW model. Dark matter substructure, derived from the light
distribution of the most luminous cluster members, is crucial for reproducing
the complexity of the quadrupole image system, which could not be achieved
otherwise. The reconstructed mass distribution closely follows the light,
however it is significantly shifted from the X-ray emission of the gas. The
mass of RCS0224-0002 derived from the lensing model, $\approx 2\times10^{14}
M_\odot$ is in a very good agreement with the one obtained from the X-ray
temperature measured with deep Chandra observations.
"
What is the method for determining the energy scales for b-quark jets and light jets at hadron colliders?,"  A method for the simultaneous determination of the energy scales for b-quark
jets and light jets, the jet energy resolution, and the top quark mass at
hadron colliders is presented. The method exploits the unique kinematics of
events with top-antitop pair production, where one of the top quarks involves a
leptonic and one a hadronic W boson decay. The paper shows a feasibility study
of how this simultaneous measurement can be performed at the upcoming LHC
experiments ATLAS and CMS.
"
What is the method of immunization that does not require knowledge of the global network structure?,"  We introduce an immunization method where the percentage of required
vaccinations for immunity are close to the optimal value of a targeted
immunization scheme of highest degree nodes. Our strategy retains the advantage
of being purely local, without the need of knowledge on the global network
structure or identification of the highest degree nodes. The method consists of
selecting a random node and asking for a neighbor that has more links than
himself or more than a given threshold and immunizing him. We compare this
method to other efficient strategies on three real social networks and on a
scale-free network model, and find it to be significantly more effective.
"
What are the implications of WIMPs with MeV scale masses for the formation of small scale structure?,"  WIMPs with electroweak scale masses (neutralinos, etc.) remain in kinetic
equilibrium with other particle species until temperatures approximately in the
range of 10 MeV to 1 GeV, leading to the formation of dark matter substructure
with masses as small as $10^{-4} M_{\odot}$ to $10^{-12} M_{\odot}$. However,
if dark matter consists of particles with MeV scale masses, as motivated by the
observation of 511 keV emission from the Galactic Bulge, such particles are
naturally expected to remain in kinetic equilibrium with the cosmic neutrino
background until considerably later times. This would lead to a strong
suppression of small scale structure with masses below about $10^7 M_{\odot}$
to $10^4 M_{\odot}$. This cutoff scale has important implications for present
and future searches for faint Local Group satellite galaxies and for the
missing satellites problem.
"
What is the Ito-Skorokhod bi-linear equation used to describe a normal triple of Hilbert spaces?,"  An Ito-Skorokhod bi-linear equation driven by infinitely many independent
colored noises is considered in a normal triple of Hilbert spaces. The special
feature of the equation is the appearance of the Wick product in the definition
of the Ito-Skorokhod integral, requiring innovative approaches to computing the
solution. A chaos expansion of the solution is derived and several truncations
of this expansion are studied. A recursive approximation of the solution is
suggested and the corresponding approximation error bound is computed.
"
What are the implications of discretization of Quantum Field Theory in a lattice with hypercubic symmetry?,"  This note presents a comparative study of various options to reduce the
errors coming from the discretization of a Quantum Field Theory in a lattice
with hypercubic symmetry. We show that it is possible to perform an
extrapolation towards the continuum which is able to eliminate systematically
the artifacts which break the O(4) symmetry.
"
What is the supersymmetry algebra in the classical limit?,"  We construct a geometric structure on deformed supermanifolds as a certain
subalgebra of the vector fields. In the classical limit we obtain a decoupling
of the infinitesimal odd and even transformations, whereas in the semiclassical
limit the result is a representation of the supersymmetry algebra. In the case
of mass preserving structure we describe all high energy corrections to this
algebra.
"
What are the implications of the dynamics of the string for the description of highly excited hadrons?,"  A large symmetry group is perhaps experimentally observed in excited hadrons
which includes the chiral group U(2)_L x U(2)_R as a subgroup. To possess this
large symmetry a dynamical model for excited hadrons, presumably a string
model, should explain formation of chiral multiplets and, at the same time,
predict coinciding slopes of the angular and radial Regge trajectories. This is
possible only if both the dynamics of the string and the chirality of the
quarks at the ends of the string are considered together. We construct a
model-independent unitary transformation from the relativistic chiral basis to
the ^{2S+1}L_J basis, commonly used in hadronic phenomenology as well as in the
string models, and demonstrate that a hadron belonging to the given chiral
representation is a fixed superposition of the basis vectors with different L's
and S's. Thus the description of highly excited hadron in terms of a fixed L is
not compatible with chiral symmetry and has to be disregarded in favour of the
description in terms of the total hadron spin J. Therefore, dynamics of the
string must deliver the principal quantum number ~n+J, in order chiral
multiplets with different spins to become degenerate, as required by the large
symmetry group.
"
"What are the structure of MHD waves, the cylindrical radial force balance, the (de)collimation, and the stability properties of magnetic tower jets?","  We argue the behavior of Poynting flux-dominated outflows from AGN in the
galactic cluster systems by performing three-dimensional MHD simulations within
the framework of the ""magnetic tower"" model. Of particular interests are the
structure of MHD waves, the cylindrical radial force balance, the
(de)collimation, and the stability properties of magnetic tower jets.
Transition between the jet/lobe and the formation of wiggling jet by growing
current-driven instability are discussed.
"
What is the relationship between the subdivision of small categories and homotopy categories of spaces and small categories?,"  We present an intrinsic and concrete development of the subdivision of small
categories, give some simple examples and derive its fundamental properties. As
an application, we deduce an alternative way to compare the homotopy categories
of spaces and small categories, by using partially ordered sets. This yields a
new conceptual proof to the well-known fact that these two homotopy categories
are equivalent.
"
What are the nonperturbative corrections in the inclusive B -> Xs l+ l- decay rate?,"  The inclusive B -> Xs l+ l- decay rate in the large q^2 region (q^2 >
m_{\psi'}^2) receives significant nonperturbative corrections. The resulting
uncertainties can be drastically reduced by normalizing the rate to the B -> Xu
l nu rate with the same q^2 cut, which allows for much improved tests of short
distance physics. We calculate this ratio, including the order 1/m_b^3
nonperturbative corrections and the analytically known NNLO perturbative
corrections. Since in the large q^2 region an inclusive measurement may be
feasible via a sum over exclusive states, our results could be useful for
measurements at LHCb and possibly for studies of B -> Xd l+ l-.
"
"How is LAL (EAL, resp.) typed terms evaluated in typed terms using Lamping's algorithm?","  Typing of lambda-terms in Elementary and Light Affine Logic (EAL, LAL, resp.)
has been studied for two different reasons: on the one hand the evaluation of
typed terms using LAL (EAL, resp.) proof-nets admits a guaranteed polynomial
(elementary, resp.) bound; on the other hand these terms can also be evaluated
by optimal reduction using the abstract version of Lamping's algorithm. The
first reduction is global while the second one is local and asynchronous. We
prove that for LAL (EAL, resp.) typed terms, Lamping's abstract algorithm also
admits a polynomial (elementary, resp.) bound. We also show its soundness and
completeness (for EAL and LAL with type fixpoints), by using a simple geometry
of interaction model (context semantics).
"
What are the phase structures of holographic QCD models at finite density and temperature?,"  Nonlocal stringy versions of the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio and Gross-Neveu models
arise in a certain limit of holographic QCD. We analyze the phase structure at
finite density and temperature at strong coupling in terms of probe branes in
the gravity dual. Comparison with the phase structure of the local field theory
models shows qualitative agreement with some aspects, and disagreement with
others. Finally, we explain how to construct the Landau potentials for these
models by taking the probe branes off-shell.
"
What is the condition for a homeomorphism between two topological spaces?,"  We will prove that one-sided topological Markov shifts $(X_A,\sigma_A)$ and
$(X_B,\sigma_B)$ for matrices $A$ and $B$ with entries in $\{0,1\}$ are
topologically orbit equivalent if and only if there exists an isomorphism
between the Cuntz-Krieger algebras ${\Cal O}_A$ and ${\Cal O}_B$ keeping their
commutative $C^*$-subalgerbas $C(X_A)$ and $C(X_B)$. It is also equivalent to
the condition that there exists a homeomorphism from $X_A$ to $X_B$
intertwining their topological full groups. We will also study structure of the
automorphisms of ${\Cal O}_A$ keeping the commutative $C^*$-algebra $C(X_A)$.
"
What is the spectral type of the star BD+43 3654 based on its new spectroscopic observations?,"  Aims: We analyze the available information on the star BD+43 3654 to
investigate the possibility that it may have had its origin in the massive OB
association Cygnus OB2.
  Methods: We present new spectroscopic observations allowing a reliable
spectral classification of the star, and discuss existing MSX observations of
its associated bow shock and astrometric information not previously studied.
  Results: Our observations reveal that BD+43 3654 is a very early and luminous
star of spectral type O4If, with an estimated mass of (70 +/- 15) solar masses
and an age of about 1.6 Myr. The high spatial resolution of the MSX
observations allows us to determine its direction of motion in the plane of the
sky by means of the symmetry axis of the well-defined bow shock, which matches
well the orientation expected from the proper motion. Tracing back its path
across the sky we find that BD+43 3654 was located near the central, densest
region of Cygnus OB2 at a time in the past similar to its estimated age.
  Conclusions: BD+43 3654 turns out to be one of the three most massive runaway
stars known, and it most likely formed in the central region of Cygnus OB2. A
runaway formation mechanism by means of dynamical ejection is consistent with
our results.
"
What is the critical mass accretion rate below which the two-temperature solution may exist in accretion flows?,"  Plasmas in an accretion flow are heated by MHD turbulence generated through
the magneto-rotational instability. The viscous stress driving the accretion is
intimately connected to the microscopic processes of turbulence dissipation. We
show that, in a few well-observed black hole accretion systems, there is
compelling observational evidence of efficient electron heating by turbulence
or collective plasma effects in low accretion states, when Coulomb collisions
are not efficient enough to establish a thermal equilibrium between electrons
and ions at small radii. However, charged particles reach a thermal equilibrium
with their kind much faster than with others through Coulomb collisions, a
two-temperature accretion flow is expected. We consider a Keplerian accretion
flow with a constant mass accretion rate in the pseudo-Newtonian gravitational
potential and take into account the bremsstrahlung, synchrotron, and inverse
Comptonization cooling processes. The critical mass accretion rate, below which
the two-temperature solution may exist, is determined by the cooling processes
and the collisional energy exchanges between electrons and ions and has very
weak dependence on the collision-less heating of electrons by turbulence, which
becomes more important at lower accretion rates. Collision-less heating of
electrons by MHD turbulence can no longer be ignored in quantitative
investigations of these systems.
"
What are the implications of the LSND observations for extended models that can accommodate all flavor-mixing signals?,"  The current status and some perspectives of the phenomenology of massive
neutrinos is reviewed. We start with the phenomenology of neutrino oscillations
in vacuum and in matter. We summarize the results of neutrino experiments using
solar, atmospheric, reactor and accelerator neutrino beams. We update the
leptonic parameters derived from the three-neutrino oscillation interpretation
of this data. We describe the method and present results on our understanding
of the solar and atmospheric neutrino fluxes by direct extraction from the
corresponding neutrino event rates. We present some tests of different forms of
new physics which induce new sources of leptonic flavor transitions in vacuum
and in matter which can be performed with the present neutrino data. The aim
and potential of future neutrino experiments and facilities to further advance
in these fronts is also briefly summarized. Last, the implications of the LSND
observations are discussed, and the status of extended models which could
accommodate all flavor-mixing signals is presented in the light of the recent
results from MiniBooNE.
"
What is the agreement between the measured two-point galaxy angular correlation function w(\theta) and the predictions from semi-analytic galaxy formation calculations?,"  We present measurements of the two-point galaxy angular correlation function
w(\theta) in the COSMOS field. Independent determinations of w(\theta) as a
function of magnitude limit are presented for both the HST ACS catalog and also
for the ground-based data from Subaru and the CFHT. Despite having
significantly different masks, these three determinations agree well. At bright
magnitudes (IAB<22), our data generally match very well with existing
measurements and with mock catalogs based on semi-analytic galaxy formation
calculations of Kitzbichler and White from the Millennium Simulation. The
exception is that our result is at the upper end of the expected cosmic
variance scatter for \theta > 10 arcmin, which we attribute to a particularly
rich structure known to exist at z~0.8. For fainter samples, however, the level
of clustering is somewhat higher than reported by some previous studies: in all
three catalogues we find w(\theta=1')~0.014 at a median IAB magnitude of 24. At
these very faintest magnitudes, our measurements agree well with the latest
determinations from the Canada-France Legacy Survey. This level of clustering
is approximately double what is predicted by the semi-analytic catalogs (at all
angles). The semi-analytic results allow an estimate of cosmic variance, which
is too small to account for the discrepancy. We therefore conclude that the
mean amplitude of clustering at this level is higher than previously estimated.
"
What are the key concepts of the dual representation of the Yang--Mills field in terms of strings?,"  We show that 3d SU(2) lattice Yang--Mills theory can be cast in the form of
an exact string representation. The derivation starts from the exact dual (or
spin foam) representation of the lattice gauge theory. We prove that every dual
configuration (or spin foam) can be equivalently described as a self--avoiding
worldsheet of strings on a framing of the lattice. Using this correspondence,
we translate the partition function into a sum over closed worldsheets that are
weighted with explicit amplitudes. The expectation value of two Polyakov loops
with spin j becomes a sum over worldsheets that are bounded by 2j strings along
a framing of the loops.
"
What is the reason for the geographic pole shift during the Pleistocene era?,"  Mammoths lived in Arctic East Siberia. In this region there is not sufficient
sunlight over the year for the growth of the plants on which these animals
feed. Therefore the latitude of this region was lower before the end of the
Pleistocene. As the cause of this geographic pole shift, we postulate a massive
object, which moved in an extremely eccentric orbit and was hot from tidal work
and solar radiation. Evaporation produced a disk-shaped cloud of ions around
the Sun. This cloud partially shielded the solar radiation, producing the cold
and warm periods that characterize the Pleistocene. The shielding depends on
the inclination of Earth's orbit, which has a period of 100'000 years. The
cloud builds up to a density at which inelastic particle collisions induce its
collapse The resulting near-periodic time dependence resembles that of
Dansgaard-Oeschger events. During cold periods fine grained inclusions were
deposited into the ice. The Pleistocene ended when the massive object had a
close encounter with the Earth, which suffered a one per mil stretching
deformation. While the deformation relaxed to an equilibrium shape in one to
several years, the globe turned relative to the rotation axis: The North Pole
moved from Greenland to the Arctic Sea. The massive object was torn to pieces,
which evaporated.
"
What are the Fibonacci distributions in Huffman codes and their role in maximizing the average length and entropy?,"  In this paper we consider the class of anti-uniform Huffman codes and derive
tight lower and upper bounds on the average length, entropy, and redundancy of
such codes in terms of the alphabet size of the source. The Fibonacci
distributions are introduced which play a fundamental role in AUH codes. It is
shown that such distributions maximize the average length and the entropy of
the code for a given alphabet size. Another previously known bound on the
entropy for given average length follows immediately from our results.
"
What is the importance of galaxy growth through major mergers for galaxies with stellar masses greater than the Milky Way?,"  We use galaxy and dark halo data from the public database for the Millennium
Simulation to study the growth of galaxies in the De Lucia et al. (2006) model
for galaxy formation. Previous work has shown this model to reproduce many
aspects of the systematic properties and the clustering of real galaxies, both
in the nearby universe and at high redshift. It assumes the stellar masses of
galaxies to increase through three processes, major mergers, the accretion of
smaller satellite systems, and star formation. We show the relative importance
of these three modes to be a strong function of stellar mass and of redshift.
Galaxy growth through major mergers depends strongly on stellar mass, but only
weakly on redshift. Except for massive systems, minor mergers contribute more
to galaxy growth than major mergers at all redshifts and at all stellar masses.
For galaxies significantly less massive than the Milky Way, star formation
dominates the growth at all epochs. For galaxies significantly more massive
than the Milky Way, growth through mergers is the dominant process at all
epochs. At a stellar mass of $6\times 10^{10}M_\odot$, star formation dominates
at $z>1$ and mergers at later times. At every stellar mass, the growth rates
through star formation increase rapidly with increasing redshift. Specific star
formation rates are a decreasing function of stellar mass not only at $z=0$ but
also at all higher redshifts. For comparison, we carry out a similar analysis
of the growth of dark matter halos. In contrast to the galaxies, growth rates
depend strongly on redshift, but only weakly on mass. They agree qualitatively
with analytic predictions for halo growth.
"
What is the deformation space of a 3-dimensional Kleinian punctured torus group?,"  Let $\Gamma$ be a 3-dimensional Kleinian punctured torus group with ccidental
parabolic transformations. The deformation space of $\Gamma$ in the group of
M\""{o}bius transformations on the 2-sphere is well-known as the Maskit slice of
punctured torus groups. In this paper, we study deformations $\Gamma'$ of
$\Gamma$ in the group of M\""{o}bius transformations on the 3-sphere such that
$\Gamma'$ does not contain screw parabolic transformations. We will show that
the space of the deformations is realized as a domain of 3-space
$\mathbb{R}^3$, which contains the Maskit slice of punctured torus groups as a
slice through a plane. Furthermore, we will show that the space also contains
the Maskit slice of fourth-punctured sphere groups as a slice through another
plane. Some of another slices of the space will be also studied.

"What are the estimated properties of ULAS J0034-00, such as its temperature, mass, and age?","  (abridged) We report the discovery of a very cool brown dwarf, ULAS
J003402.77-005206.7 (ULAS J0034-00), identified in UKIDSS DR1. We provide
optical, near-infrared, and mid-infrared photometry of the source, and two
near-infrared spectra. Comparing the spectral energy distribution of ULAS
J0034-00 to that of the T8 brown dwarf 2MASS J0415-09, the latest-type and
coolest well-studied brown dwarf to date, with Teff~750 K, we find evidence
that ULAS J0034-00 is significantly cooler. First, the measured values of the
near-infrared absorption spectral indices imply a later classification, of
T8.5. Second, the H-[4.49] colour provides an empirical estimate of the
temperature of 540<Teff<660 K (+/-2sig range). Third, the J- and H-band peaks
are somewhat narrower in ULAS J0034-00, and detailed comparison against
spectral models calibrated to 2MASS J0415-09 yields an estimated temperature
lower by 60-120 K relative to 2MASS J0415-09 i.e. 630<Teff<690 K (+/-2sig), and
lower gravity or higher metallicity according to the degenerate combination
-0.5<delta(log g-2[m/H])<-0.25 (+/-2sig). Combining these estimates, and
considering systematics, it is likely the temperature lies in the range
600<Teff<700 K. Despite the low inferred Teff we find no evidence for strong
absorption by NH3 over the wavelength range 1.51-1.56 um. Evolutionary models
imply that the mass and age are in the ranges 15-36 M(Jup) and 0.5-8 Gyr,
respectively. The measured proper motion, of (0.37+/-0.07)arcsec/yr, combined
with the photometrically estimated distance of 14-22 pc, implies a tangential
velocity of ~30 km/s. ULAS J0034-00 is significantly bluer than 2MASS J0415-09
in Y-J, so future searches should allow for the possibility that cooler T
dwarfs are bluer still.
"
What is the symmetry of the junction between a normal metal and a Berezinskii superconductor?,"  The conductance of a junction between a normal metal and a superconductor
having the symmetry proposed by Berezinskii is studied theoretically. The main
feature of this symmetry is the odd frequency dependence of the anomalous Green
function, which makes possible the s-wave triplet superconducting state (the
Berezinskii superconductor). The Andreev reflection (which links positive and
negative energies) is sensitive to the energetic symmetry; as a result, the
conductance of the junction involving the Berezinskii superconductor is
qualitatively different from the case of a conventional superconductor.
Experimentally, the obtained results can be employed to test the possibility of
the Berezinskii superconductivity proposed for Na$_x$CoO$_2$ and to identify
the odd-omega component predicted for superconductor-ferromagnet junctions.
"
What are the basic properties of RNA folding maps that also hold for combinatorial maps?,"  In this paper we present a novel framework for sequence to shape maps. These
combinatorial maps realize exponentially many shapes, and have preimages which
contain extended connected subgraphs of diameter n (neutral networks). We prove
that all basic properties of RNA folding maps also hold for combinatorial maps.
Our construction is as follows: suppose we are given a graph $H$ over the $\{1
>...,n\}$ and an alphabet of nucleotides together with a symmetric relation
$\mathcal{R}$, implied by base pairing rules. Then the shape of a sequence of
length n is the maximal H subgraph in which all pairs of nucleotides incident
to H-edges satisfy $\mathcal{R}$. Our main result is to prove the existence of
at least $\sqrt{2}^{n-1}$ shapes with extended neutral networks, i.e. shapes
that have a preimage with diameter $n$ and a connected component of size at
least $(\frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2})^n+(\frac{1-\sqrt{5}}{2})^n$. Furthermore, we show
that there exists a certain subset of shapes which carries a natural graph
structure. In this graph any two shapes are connected by a path of shapes with
respective neutral networks of distance one. We finally discuss our results and
provide a comparison with RNA folding maps.
"
What are the asymptotic mass of the regular traversable Wu-Yang wormhole and its throat radius?,"  We discuss exact solutions of three-parameter non-minimal Einstein-Yang-Mills
model, which describe the wormholes of a new type. These wormholes are
considered to be supported by SU(2)-symmetric Yang-Mills field, non-minimally
coupled to gravity, the Wu-Yang ansatz for the gauge field being used. We
distinguish between regular solutions, describing traversable non-minimal
Wu-Yang wormholes, and black wormholes possessing one or two event horizons.
The relation between the asymptotic mass of the regular traversable Wu-Yang
wormhole and its throat radius is analysed.
"
What is the complete characterization of all supersymmetric solutions?,"  We find a complete characterization of all the supersymmetric solutions of
non-Abelian gauged N=1,d=5 supergravity coupled to vector multiplets and
hypermultiplets: the generic forms of the metrics as functions of the scalars
and vector fields plus the equations that all these must satisfy. These
equations are now a complicated non-linear system and there it seems impossible
to produce an algorithm to construct systematically all supersymmetric
solutions.
"
What are the implications of the Purcell's scallop theorem for the study of the motion of a solid body in a viscous fluid?,"  Purcell's scallop theorem defines the type of motions of a solid body -
reciprocal motions - which cannot propel the body in a viscous fluid with zero
Reynolds number. For example, the flapping of a wing is reciprocal and, as was
recently shown, can lead to directed motion only if its frequency Reynolds
number, Re_f, is above a critical value of order one. Using elementary
examples, we show the existence of oscillatory reciprocal motions which are
effective for all arbitrarily small values of the frequency Reynolds number and
induce net velocities scaling as (Re_f)^\alpha (alpha > 0). This demonstrates a
continuous breakdown of the scallop theorem with inertia.
"
What are the conditions for optimality for this model?,"  We develop a model of the behaviour of a dynamically optimizing economic
agent who makes consumption-saving and spatial relocation decisions. We
formulate an existence result for the model, derive the necessary conditions
for optimality and study the behaviour of the economic agent, focusing on the
case of a wage distribution with a single maximum.
"
What is the relationship between the energy density and the direction of the singularity?,"  In a previous paper we formulated a set of necessary conditions for the
spherically symmetric weakly charged dust to avoid Big Bang/Big Crunch, shell
crossing and permanent central singularities. However, we did not discuss the
properties of the energy density, some of which are surprising and seem not to
have been known up to now. A singularity of infinite energy density does exist
-- it is a point singularity situated on the world line of the center of
symmetry. The condition that no mass shell collapses to $R = 0$ if it had $R >
0$ initially thus turns out to be still insufficient for avoiding a
singularity. Moreover, at the singularity the energy density $\epsilon$ is
direction-dependent: $\epsilon \to - \infty$ when we approach the singular
point along a $t =$ const hypersurface and $\epsilon \to + \infty$ when we
approach that point along the center of symmetry. The appearance of
negative-energy-density regions turns out to be inevitable. We discuss various
aspects of this property of our configuration. We also show that a permanently
pulsating configuration, with the period of pulsation independent of mass, is
possible only if there exists a permanent central singularity.
"
What are the cosmological effects of the interaction terms in the Friedmann equations?,"  Universe evolution, as described by Friedmann's equations, is determined by
source terms fixed by the choice of pressure $\times$ energy-density equations
of state $p(\rho)$. The usual approach in Cosmology considers equations of
state accounting only for kinematic terms, ignoring the contribution from the
interactions between the particles constituting the source fluid. In this work
the importance of these neglected terms is emphasized. A systematic method,
based on the Statistical Mechanics of real fluids, is proposed to include them.
A toy-model is presented which shows how such interaction terms can engender
significant cosmological effects.
"
What are the results of the $|V_{ub}|f_+(0)$ and $|V_{ub}|$ obtained from the spectrum of $B\to\pi e \nu$?,"  I discuss the results for $|V_{ub}|f_+(0)$ and $|V_{ub}|$ obtained from the
spectrum of $B\to\pi e \nu$ and the form factor $f_+(q^2)$ from QCD sum rules
on the light-cone and unquenched lattice calculations; the shape of $f_+(q^2)$
is fixed from experimental data.
"
How does the spin component C_s (T) behave as T depends on the backscattering amplitude g_1?,"  We re-visit the issue of the temperature dependence of the specific heat C(T)
for interacting fermions in 1D. The charge component C_c(T) scales linearly
with T, but the spin component C_s (T) displays a more complex behavior with T
as it depends on the backscattering amplitude, g_1, which scales down under RG
transformation and eventually behaves as g_1 (T) \sim 1/\log T. We show,
however, by direct perturbative calculations that C_s(T) is strictly linear in
T to order g^2_1 as it contains the renormalized backscattering amplitude not
on the scale of T, but at the cutoff scale set by the momentum dependence of
the interaction around 2k_F. The running amplitude g_1 (T) appears only at
third order and gives rise to an extra T/\log^3 T term in C_s (T). This agrees
with the results obtained by a variety of bosonization techniques. We also show
how to obtain the same expansion in g_1 within the sine-Gordon model.
"
What is the nonlocal de Broglie-Bohm trajectory prescription for an entangled state of massive particles?,"  We present a local interpretation of what is usually considered to be a
nonlocal de Broglie-Bohm trajectory prescription for an entangled singlet state
of massive particles. After reviewing various meanings of the term
``nonlocal'', we show that by using appropriately retarded wavefunctions (i.e.,
the locality loophole) this local model can violate Bell's inequality, without
making any appeal to detector inefficiencies.
  We analyze a possible experimental configuration appropriate to massive
two-particle singlet wavefunctions and find that as long as the particles are
not ultra-relativistic, a locality loophole exists and Dirac wave(s) can
propagate from Alice or Bob's changing magnetic field, through space, to the
other detector, arriving before the particle and thereby allowing a local
interpretation to the 2-particle de Broglie-Bohm trajectories.
  We also propose a physical effect due to changing magnetic fields in a
Stern-Gerlach EPR setup that will throw away events and create a detector
loophole in otherwise perfectly efficient detectors, an effect that is only
significant for near-luminal particles that might otherwise close the locality
loophole.
"
What is the Lagrangian of electromagnetic field interaction with polarizable 1/2-spin particles?,"  Using the relativistic electrodynamics of continuous media formalism and main
relativistic quantum field theory principles the covariant Lagrangian of
electromagnetic field interaction with polarizable 1/2-spin particles have been
obtained. This Lagrangian let us to determine canonical and metric
energy-momentum tensors as well as low-energy Compton scattering amplitude. The
application of this Lagrangian for the calculation of the radiative correction
to the imaginary part of double virtual Compton scattering is demonstrated.
"
What is the relationship between the number of vertices and the knot type?,"  For every knot K with stick number k there is a knotted polyhedral torus of
knot type K with 3k vertices. We prove that at least 3k-2 vertices are
necessary.
"
What is the mechanism for a mechanical transmission that produces a sliding motion?,"  The design of a mechanical transmission taking into account the transmitted
forces is reported in this paper. This transmission is based on Slide-o-Cam, a
cam mechanism with multiple rollers mounted on a common translating follower.
The design of Slide-o-Cam, a transmission intended to produce a sliding motion
from a turning drive, or vice versa, was reported elsewhere. This transmission
provides pure-rolling motion, thereby reducing the friction of rack-and-pinions
and linear drives. The pressure angle is a suitable performance index for this
transmission because it determines the amount of force transmitted to the load
vs. that transmitted to the machine frame. To assess the transmission
capability of the mechanism, the Hertz formula is introduced to calculate the
stresses on the rollers and on the cams. The final transmission is intended to
replace the current ball-screws in the Orthoglide, a three-DOF parallel robot
for the production of translational motions, currently under development for
machining applications at Ecole Centrale de Nantes.
"
How do information functionals quantify the degree of randomness of a probability distribution?,"  Information functionals allow to quantify the degree of randomness of a given
probability distribution, either absolutely (through min/max entropy
principles) or relative to a prescribed reference one. Our primary aim is to
analyze the ""minimum information"" assumption, which is a classic concept (R.
Balian, 1968) in the random matrix theory. We put special emphasis on generic
level (eigenvalue) spacing distributions and the degree of their randomness, or
alternatively - information/organization deficit.
"
What is the Strato-rotational Instability (SRI) and its relation to accretion disks?,"  This study is devoted to the experimental analysis of the Strato-rotational
Instability (SRI). This instability affects the classical cylindrical Couette
flow when the fluid is stably stratified in the axial direction. In agreement
with recent theoretical and numerical analyses, we describe for the first time
in detail the destabilization of the stratified flow below the Rayleigh line
(i.e. the stability threshold without stratification). We confirm that the
unstable modes of the SRI are non axisymmetric, oscillatory, and take place as
soon as the azimuthal linear velocity decreases along the radial direction.
This new instability is relevant for accretion disks.
"
What is the relationship between the mass of domain wall fermions (DWF) and the size of the fifth dimension?,"  We present results for the dependence of the residual mass of domain wall
fermions (DWF) on the size of the fifth dimension and its relation to the
density and localization properties of low-lying eigenvectors of the
corresponding hermitian Wilson Dirac operator relevant to simulations of 2+1
flavor domain wall QCD. Using the DBW2 and Iwasaki gauge actions, we generate
ensembles of configurations with a $16^3\times 32$ space-time volume and an
extent of 8 in the fifth dimension for the sea quarks. We demonstrate the
existence of a regime where the degree of locality, the size of chiral symmetry
breaking and the rate of topology change can be acceptable for inverse lattice
spacings $a^{-1} \ge 1.6$ GeV.
"
What boundary conditions are used in the Einstein equations for a Schwarzschild black hole?,"  Various methods of treating outer boundaries in numerical relativity are
compared using a simple test problem: a Schwarzschild black hole with an
outgoing gravitational wave perturbation. Numerical solutions computed using
different boundary treatments are compared to a `reference' numerical solution
obtained by placing the outer boundary at a very large radius. For each
boundary treatment, the full solutions including constraint violations and
extracted gravitational waves are compared to those of the reference solution,
thereby assessing the reflections caused by the artificial boundary. These
tests use a first-order generalized harmonic formulation of the Einstein
equations. Constraint-preserving boundary conditions for this system are
reviewed, and an improved boundary condition on the gauge degrees of freedom is
presented. Alternate boundary conditions evaluated here include freezing the
incoming characteristic fields, Sommerfeld boundary conditions, and the
constraint-preserving boundary conditions of Kreiss and Winicour. Rather
different approaches to boundary treatments, such as sponge layers and spatial
compactification, are also tested. Overall the best treatment found here
combines boundary conditions that preserve the constraints, freeze the
Newman-Penrose scalar Psi_0, and control gauge reflections.
"
What are the dual Hopf algebras of the orthogonal and symplectic subgroups of the general linear group?,"  The character ring \CGL of covariant irreducible tensor representations of
the general linear group admits a Hopf algebra structure isomorphic to the Hopf
algebra \Sym$ of symmetric functions. Here we study the character rings \CO and
\CSp of the orthogonal and symplectic subgroups of the general linear group
within the same framework of symmetric functions. We show that \CO and \CSp
also admit natural Hopf algebra structures that are isomorphic to that of \CGL,
and hence to \Sym. The isomorphisms are determined explicitly, along with the
specification of standard bases for \CO and \CSp analogous to those used for
\Sym. A major structural change arising from the adoption of these bases is the
introduction of new orthogonal and symplectic Schur-Hall scalar products.
Significantly, the adjoint with respect to multiplication no longer coincides,
as it does in the \CGL case, with a Foulkes derivative or skew operation. The
adjoint and Foulkes derivative now require separate definitions, and their
properties are explored here in the orthogonal and symplectic cases. Moreover,
the Hopf algebras \CO and \CSp are not self-dual. The dual Hopf algebras \CO^*
and \CSp^* are identified. Finally, the Hopf algebra of the universal rational
character ring \CGLrat of mixed irreducible tensor representations of the
general linear group is introduced and its structure maps identified.
"
What are the implications of the upper bounds on the Frobenius trace and Frobenius field for the geometry of the curve?,"  We prove that the set of Farey fractions of order $T$, that is, the set
$\{\alpha/\beta \in \Q : \gcd(\alpha, \beta) = 1, 1 \le \alpha, \beta \le T\}$,
is uniformly distributed in residue classes modulo a prime $p$ provided $T \ge
p^{1/2 +\eps}$ for any fixed $\eps>0$. We apply this to obtain upper bounds for
the Lang--Trotter conjectures on Frobenius traces and Frobenius fields ``on
average'' over a one-parametric family of elliptic curves.
"
"What is the problem of binary classification where one can, for a particular cost, choose not to classify an observation?","  We consider the problem of binary classification where one can, for a
particular cost, choose not to classify an observation. We present a simple
proof for the oracle inequality for the excess risk of structural risk
minimizers using a lasso type penalty.
"
What is the general criterion leading to the hydrodynamic limit of exclusion processes among random conductances?,"  We consider a stationary and ergodic random field {\omega(b)} parameterized
by the family of bonds b in Z^d, d>1. The random variable \omega(b) is thought
of as the conductance of bond b and it ranges in a finite interval [0,c_0].
Assuming that the set of bonds with positive conductance has a unique infinite
cluster C, we prove homogenization results for the random walk among random
conductances on C. As a byproduct, applying the general criterion of \cite{F}
leading to the hydrodynamic limit of exclusion processes with bond-dependent
transition rates, for almost all realizations of the environment we prove the
hydrodynamic limit of simple exclusion processes among random conductances on
C. The hydrodynamic equation is given by a heat equation whose diffusion matrix
does not depend on the environment. We do not require any ellipticity
condition. As special case, C can be the infinite cluster of supercritical
Bernoulli bond percolation.
"
What are the results of the TDDFT calculations of the off-diagonal elements of the exciton matrix?,"  Excited states of the of the double-stranded DNA model
(A)$_{12}\cdot$(T)_{12} were calculated in the framework of the exciton theory.
The off-diagonal elements of the exciton matrix were calculated using the
transition densities and ideal dipole approximation associated with the lowest
energy $\pi\pi^{*}$ excitations of the individual nucleobases obtained from
TDDFT calculations. The values of the coupling calculated with the transition
density cubes (TDC) and ideal-dipole approximation (IDA) methods were found
significantly different for the small inter-chromophore distances. It was shown
that the IDA overestimates the coupling significantly. The effects of the
structural fluctuations were incorporated by averaging the properties of the
excited states over a large number of conformations obtained from the MD
simulations.
"
What is the connection between the local ubiquity framework and the Diophantine approximation on limit sets of Kleinian groups?,"  There are two fundamental results in the classical theory of metric
Diophantine approximation: Khintchine's theorem and Jarnik's theorem. The
former relates the size of the set of well approximable numbers, expressed in
terms of Lebesgue measure, to the behavior of a certain volume sum. The latter
is a Hausdorff measure version of the former. We start by discussing these
theorems and show that they are both in fact a simple consequence of the notion
of `local ubiquity'. The local ubiquity framework introduced here is a much
simplified and more transparent version of that in \cite{memoirs}. Furthermore,
it leads to a single local ubiquity theorem that unifies the Lebesgue and
Hausdorff theories. As an application of our framework we consider the theory
of metric Diophantine approximation on limit sets of Kleinian groups. In
particular, we obtain a general Hausdorff measure version of Sullivan's
logarithm law for geodesics -- an aspect overlooked in \cite{memoirs}.
"
What is the storage of quantum information in spin Hamiltonians with degenerate ground states?,"  Spin Hamiltonians with degenerate ground states are one potential system for
the storage of quantum information at low temperatures. Trapped ions can be
used to simulate the dynamics of these Hamiltonians, but the
coherence-preserving properties will be lost. This illustrates that a quantum
simulation performed in an interaction frame will not thermalize with its
environment.
"
What are the difficulties in MOND-like models proposed in the literature?,"  Modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND) is a possible way to explain the flat
galaxy rotation curves without invoking the existence of dark matter. It is
however quite difficult to predict such a phenomenology in a consistent field
theory, free of instabilities and admitting a well-posed Cauchy problem. We
examine critically various proposals of the literature, and underline their
successes and failures both from the experimental and the field-theoretical
viewpoints. We exhibit new difficulties in both cases, and point out the hidden
fine tuning of some models. On the other hand, we show that several published
no-go theorems are based on hypotheses which may be unnecessary, so that the
space of possible models is a priori larger. We examine a new route to
reproduce the MOND physics, in which the field equations are particularly
simple outside matter. However, the analysis of the field equations within
matter (a crucial point which is often forgotten in the literature) exhibits a
deadly problem, namely that they do not remain always hyperbolic. Incidentally,
we prove that the same theoretical framework provides a stable and well-posed
model able to reproduce the Pioneer anomaly without spoiling any of the
precision tests of general relativity. Our conclusion is that all MOND-like
models proposed in the literature, including the new ones examined in this
paper, present serious difficulties: Not only they are unnaturally fine tuned,
but they also fail to reproduce some experimental facts or are unstable or
inconsistent as field theories. However, some frameworks, notably the
tensor-vector-scalar (TeVeS) one of Bekenstein and Sanders, seem more promising
than others, and our discussion underlines in which directions one should try
to improve them.
"
How does the effective charge Q of the phosphate group affect the minima of the pair interaction U of DNA molecules?,"  We study a model for pair interaction $U$ of DNA molecules generated by the
discrete dipole moments of base-pairs and the charges of phosphate groups, and
find noncommutative group of eighth order ${\cal S}$ of symmetries that leave
$U$ invariant. We classify the minima using group ${\cal S}$ and employ
numerical methods for finding them. The minima may correspond to several
cholesteric phases, as well as phases formed by cross-like conformations of
molecules at an angle close to $\rm{90}^{o}$, ""snowflake phase"". The results
depend on the effective charge $Q$ of the phosphate group which can be modified
by the polycations or the ions of metals. The snowflake phase could exist for
$Q$ above the threshold $Q_C$. Below $Q_C$ there could be several cholesteric
phases. Close to $Q_C$ the snowflake phase could change into the cholesteric
one at constant distance between adjacent molecules.
"
What are the assumptions for the Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet Field Equation?,"  We give all exact solutions of the Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet Field Equations
coupled with a scalar field in four dimensions under certain assumptions.
"
What are the implications of the HyperCP findings for the search for the Higgs boson?,"  We study the potential of radiative decays of the Upsilon(1S) and of the phi
mesons to search for a light pseudoscalar Higgs boson, proposed as a possible
interpretation of Sigma+ --> p mu+mu- events observed by the HyperCP
collaboration at Fermilab. We conclude that the detection of this signal should
certainly be possible with the current CLEO Upsilon(1S) data, and is within the
reach of KLOE in at least part of the range of couplings suggested by the
HyperCP findings.
"
What are the conditions for the solutions of the problem to be global in time or to blow up in finite time?,"  We study the Cauchy problem for a system of two coupled nonlinear focusing
Schroedinger equations arising in nonlinear optics. We discuss when the
solutions are global in time or blow-up in finite time. Some results, in
dependence of the data of the problem, are proved; in particular we give a
bound, depending on the coupling parameter, for the blow-up threshold.
"
What are the translational temperatures of desorbed molecules in the three distinct photodesorption processes?,"  We present experimental measurements of photodesorption from ices of
astrophysical relevance. Layers of benzene and water ice were irradiated with a
laser tuned to an electronic transition in the benzene molecule. The
translational energy of desorbed molecules was measured by time-of-flight (ToF)
mass spectrometry. Three distinct photodesorption processes were identified - a
direct adsorbate-mediated desorption producing benzene molecules with a
translational temperature of around 1200 K, an indirect adsorbate-mediated
desorption resulting in water molecules with a translational temperature of
around 450 K, and a substrate-mediated desorption of both benzene and water
producing molecules with translational temperatures of around 530 K and 450 K
respectively. The translational temperature of each population of desorbed
molecules is well above the temperature of the ice matrix. The implications for
gas-phase chemistry in the interstellar medium are discussed.
"
What are the characteristics of the firms that act as trending firms?,"  The understanding of complex social or economic systems is an important
scientific challenge. Here we present a comprehensive study of the Spanish
Stock Exchange showing that most financial firms trading in that market are
characterized by a resulting strategy and can be classified in groups of firms
with different specialization. Few large firms overally act as trending firms
whereas many heterogeneous firm act as reversing firms. The herding properties
of these two groups are markedly different and consistently observed over a
four-year period of trading.
"
What are the observing facilities in Southern Africa before the SKA telescope was built?,"  The government of South Africa has identified astronomy as a field in which
their country has a strategic advantage and is consequently investing very
significantly in astronomical infrastructure. South Africa now operates a 10-m
class optical telescope, the Southern African Large Telescope (SALT), and is
one of two countries short listed to host the Square Kilometre Array (SKA), an
ambitious international project to construct a radio telescope with a
sensitivity one hundred times that of any existing telescope. The challenge now
is to produce an indigenous community of users for these facilities,
particularly from among the black population which was severely disadvantaged
under the apartheid regime. In this paper I briefly describe the observing
facilities in Southern Africa before going on to discuss the various
collaborations that are allowing us to use astronomy as a tool for development,
and at the same time to train a new generation of astronomers who will be well
grounded in the science and linked to their colleagues internationally.
"
What is the purpose of the collection of algorithms presented in this paper?,"  We present a collection of algorithms which utilize dimensional reduction to
perform mesh refinement and study possibly singular solutions of time-dependent
partial differential equations. The algorithms are inspired by constructions
used in statistical mechanics to evaluate the properties of a system near a
critical point. The first algorithm allows the accurate determination of the
time of occurrence of a possible singularity. The second algorithm is an
adaptive mesh refinement scheme which can be used to approach efficiently the
possible singularity. Finally, the third algorithm uses the second algorithm
until the available resolution is exhausted (as we approach the possible
singularity) and then switches to a dimensionally reduced model which, when
accurate, can follow faithfully the solution beyond the time of occurrence of
the purported singularity. An accurate dimensionally reduced model should
dissipate energy at the right rate. We construct two variants of each
algorithm. The first variant assumes that we have actual knowledge of the
reduced model. The second variant assumes that we know the form of the reduced
model, i.e. the terms appearing in the reduced model, but not necessarily their
coefficients. In this case, we also provide a way of determining the
coefficients. We present numerical results for the Burgers equation with zero
and nonzero viscosity to illustrate the use of the algorithms.

What is the importance of diversity gain over multiplexing gain at low SNR in cooperative networks?,"  Performance of cooperative diversity schemes at Low Signal to Noise Ratios
(LSNR) was recently studied by Avestimehr et. al. [1] who emphasized the
importance of diversity gain over multiplexing gain at low SNRs. It has also
been pointed out that continuous energy transfer to the channel is necessary
for achieving the max-flow min-cut bound at LSNR. Motivated by this we propose
the use of Selection Decode and Forward (SDF) at LSNR and analyze its
performance in terms of the outage probability. We also propose an energy
optimization scheme which further brings down the outage probability.
"
What are the conditions for a polynomial of the form x^r*(1+x^v+x^(2v)+...+x^(kv))^t to permute the elements of the finite field GF(q)?,"  We give necessary and sufficient conditions for a polynomial of the form
x^r*(1+x^v+x^(2v)+...+x^(kv))^t to permute the elements of the finite field
GF(q). Our results yield especially simple criteria in case (q-1)/gcd(q-1,v) is
a small prime.
"
What is the behavior of the energy in the universe when its volume is small or large?,"  If in a finite universe, the tree-level vacuum is a symmetric superposition
of coherent states, in each of which the inflaton field assumes a different,
energy-minimizing mean value (vev), then the resulting energy is positive and
decreases exponentially as the volume of the universe increases. This effect
can drive inflation when that volume is small and explain part of dark energy
when it is big, but the effect is exceedingly tiny except at very early times.
"
What is the distribution of highly-obscured star-forming regions in a sample of 38 nearby galaxies?,"  Using the new capabilities of the Spitzer Space Telescope and extensive
multiwavelength data from the Spitzer Infrared Nearby Galaxies Survey (SINGS),
it is now possible to study the infrared properties of star formation in nearby
galaxies down to scales equivalent to large HII regions. We are therefore able
to determine what fraction of large, infrared-selected star-forming regions in
normal galaxies are highly obscured and address how much of the star formation
we miss by relying solely on the optical portion of the spectrum. Employing a
new empirical method for deriving attenuations of infrared-selected
star-forming regions we investigate the statistics of obscured star formation
on 500pc scales in a sample of 38 nearby galaxies. We find that the median
attenuation is 1.4 magnitudes in H-alpha and that there is no evidence for a
substantial sub-population of uniformly highly-obscured star-forming regions.
The regions in the highly-obscured tail of the attenuation distribution
(A_H-alpha > 3) make up only ~4% of the sample of nearly 1800 regions, though
very embedded infrared sources on the much smaller scales and lower
luminosities of compact and ultracompact HII regions are almost certainly
present in greater numbers. The highly-obscured cases in our sample are
generally the bright, central regions of galaxies with high overall attenuation
but are not otherwise remarkable. We also find that a majority of the galaxies
show decreasing radial trends in H-alpha attenuation. The small fraction of
highly-obscured regions seen in this sample of normal, star-forming galaxies
suggests that on 500pc scales the timescale for significant dispersal or break
up of nearby, optically-thick dust clouds is short relative to the lifetime of
a typical star-forming region.

"What are the solutions of the rational functions f,g,h in the field K?","  We find all polynomials f,g,h over a field K such that g and h are linear and
f(g(x))=h(f(x)). We also solve the same problem for rational functions f,g,h,
in case the field K is algebraically closed.
"
What are the implications of the spatial inhomogeneity for the predictions of uniform models in comparison with the correlations observed in real systems?,"  We perform first-principles quantum simulations of dissociation of trapped,
spatially inhomogeneous Bose-Einstein condensates of molecular dimers.
Specifically, we study spatial pair correlations of atoms produced in
dissociation after time of flight. We find that the observable correlations may
significantly degrade in systems with spatial inhomogeneity compared to the
predictions of idealized uniform models. We show how binning of the signal can
enhance the detectable correlations and lead to the violation of the classical
Cauchy-Schwartz inequality and relative number squeezing.
"
What is the technique of obtaining skew-orthogonal polynomials with quartic weight?,"  We present an iterative technique to obtain skew-orthogonal polynomials with
quartic weight, arising in the study of symplectic ensembles of random
matrices.
"
What are the characteristics of ring dark solitons and spherical shell solitons?,"  We review a number of topics germane to higher-dimensional solitons in
Bose-Einstein condensates. For dark solitons, we discuss dark band and planar
solitons; ring dark solitons and spherical shell solitons; solitary waves in
restricted geometries; vortex rings and rarefaction pulses; and multi-component
Bose-Einstein condensates. For bright solitons, we discuss instability,
stability, and metastability; bright soliton engineering, including pulsed atom
lasers; solitons in a thermal bath; soliton-soliton interactions; and bright
ring solitons and quantum vortices. A thorough reference list is included.
"
What are the new classes of Nash Equilibrium and quantum computing relevant to Hilbert space?,"  In this paper we review our earlier work on quantum computing and the Nash
Equilibrium, in particular, tracing the history of the discovery of new Nash
Equilibria and then reviewing the ways in which quantum computing may be
expected to generate new classes of Nash equilibria. We then extend this work
through a substantive analysis of examples provided by Meyer, Flitney, Iqbal
and Weigert and Cheon and Tsutsui with respect to quantized games, quantum game
strategies and the extension of Nash Equilibrium to solvable games in Hilbert
space. Finally, we review earlier work by Sato, Taiji and Ikegami on non-linear
computation and computational classes by way of reference to coherence,
decoherence and quantum computating systems.
"
What are the assumptions on the growth of solutions for large time in the Maxwell-Schrödinger system?,"  We prove the uniqueness of solutions of the Maxwell-Schr""odinger system with
given asymptotic behaviour at infinity in time. The assumptions include
suitable restrictions on the growth of solutions for large time and on the
accuracy of their asymptotics, but no restriction on their size. The result
applies to the solutions with prescribed asymptotics constructed in a previous
paper.
"
"What are the connections between the Airy function and the Brownian motion, bridge, excursion, meander and double meander processes?","  This survey is a collection of various results and formulas by different
authors on the areas (integrals) of five related processes, viz.\spacefactor
=1000 Brownian motion, bridge, excursion, meander and double meander; for the
Brownian motion and bridge, which take both positive and negative values, we
consider both the integral of the absolute value and the integral of the
positive (or negative) part. This gives us seven related positive random
variables, for which we study, in particular, formulas for moments and Laplace
transforms; we also give (in many cases) series representations and asymptotics
for density functions and distribution functions. We further study Wright's
constants arising in the asymptotic enumeration of connected graphs; these are
known to be closely connected to the moments of the Brownian excursion area.
The main purpose is to compare the results for these seven Brownian areas by
stating the results in parallel forms; thus emphasizing both the similarities
and the differences. A recurring theme is the Airy function which appears in
slightly different ways in formulas for all seven random variables. We further
want to give explicit relations between the many different similar notations
and definitions that have been used by various authors. There are also some new
results, mainly to fill in gaps left in the literature. Some short proofs are
given, but most proofs are omitted and the reader is instead referred to the
original sources.
"
What is the relationship between the extrinsic ligand concentrations and the phenotypic changes in NSCLC?,"  Background The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is frequently
overexpressed in many cancers, including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In
silcio modeling is considered to be an increasingly promising tool to add
useful insights into the dynamics of the EGFR signal transduction pathway.
However, most of the previous modeling work focused on the molecular or the
cellular level only, neglecting the crucial feedback between these scales as
well as the interaction with the heterogeneous biochemical microenvironment.
  Results We developed a multiscale model for investigating expansion dynamics
of NSCLC within a two-dimensional in silico microenvironment. At the molecular
level, a specific EGFR-ERK intracellular signal transduction pathway was
implemented. Dynamical alterations of these molecules were used to trigger
phenotypic changes at the cellular level. Examining the relationship between
extrinsic ligand concentrations, intrinsic molecular profiles and microscopic
patterns, the results confirmed that increasing the amount of available growth
factor leads to a spatially more aggressive cancer system. Moreover, for the
cell closest to nutrient abundance, a phase-transition emerges where a minimal
increase in extrinsic ligand abolishes the proliferative phenotype altogether.
  Conclusions Our in silico results indicate that, in NSCLC, in the presence of
a strong extrinsic chemotactic stimulus, and depending on the cell's location,
downstream EGFR-ERK signaling may be processed more efficiently, thereby
yielding a migration-dominant cell phenotype and overall, an accelerated
spatio-temporal expansion rate.
"
What are the characteristics of the two subpopulations of the Globular Cluster system in the galaxy NGC5866?,"  We perform a detailed study of the Globular Cluster (GC) system in the galaxy
NGC5866 based on F435W, F555W, and F625W (~ B, V, and R) HST Advanced Camera
for Surveys images.
  Adopting color, size and shape selection criteria, the final list of GC
candidates comprises 109 objects, with small estimated contamination from
background galaxies, and foreground stars.
  The color distribution of the final GC sample has a bimodal form. Adopting
color to metallicity transformations derived from the Teramo--SPoT simple
stellar population model, we estimate a metallicity [Fe/H]~ -1.5, and -0.6 dex
for the blue and red peaks, respectively. A similar result is found if the
empirical color-metallicity relations derived from Galactic GCs data are used.
  The two subpopulations show some of the features commonly observed in the GC
system of other galaxies, like a ``blue tilt'', higher central concentrations
of the red subsystem, and larger half--light radii at larger galactocentric
distances. However, we do not find evidence of a substantial difference between
the average sizes of red and blue clusters.
  Our analysis of the GC Luminosity Function indicates a V-band Turn-Over
Magnitude V$_0^{TOM}$=23.46+-0.06, or M$_{V,0}^{TOM}\sim-7.29 +- 0.10$ mag,
using the distance modulus derived from the average of SBF and the PNLF
distances. The absolute Turn-Over Magnitude obtained agrees well with
calibrations from literature. The specific frequency is measured to be $S_N=1.4
+- 0.3$, typical for galaxies of this type.
"
What is the relationship between the Entropy Penalized Method and the decay of correlation for a stationary stochastic process?,"  We provide a short and elementary proof for the recently proved result by G.
da Prato and H. Frankowska that -- under minimal assumptions -- a closed set is
invariant with respect to a stochastic control system if and only if it is
invariant with respect to the (associated) deterministic control system.
"
What is the Resonating Valence Bond (RVB) theory of high temperature superconductivity?,"  We review the Resonating Valence Bond (RVB) theory of high temperatur e
superconductivity using Gutzwiller projected wave functions that incorporate
strong correlations. After a general overview of the phenomenon of high
temperature superconductivity, we discuss Anderson's RVB picture and its
implementation by renormalised mean field theory (RMFT) and variational Monte
Carlo (VMC) techniques. We review RMFT and VMC results with an emphasis on
recent development s in extending VMC and RMFT techniques to excited states. We
compare results obtained from these methods with angle resolved photoemission
spectroscopy (ARPES) and scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM). We conclude by
summarising recent successes of this approach and discuss open problems that
need to be solved for a consistent and complete description of high temperature
superconductivity using Gutzwiller projected wave functions.
"
What are the two new generalizations of the Bardeen-Press equations?,"  We use the, covariant and gauge-invariant, 1+1+2 formalism developed by
Clarkson and Barrett, and develop new techniques, to decouple electromagnetic
(EM) perturbations on arbitrary locally rotationally symmetric (LRS)
space-times. Ultimately, we derive 3 decoupled complex equations governing 3
complex scalars. One of these is a new Regge-Wheeler (RW) equation generalized
for LRS space-times, whereas the remaining two are new generalizations of the
Bardeen-Press (BP) equations. This is achieved by first using linear algebra
techniques to rewrite the first-order Maxwell equations in a new complex 1+1+2
form which is conducive to decoupling. This new complex system immediately
yields the generalized RW equation, and furthermore, we also derive a decoupled
equation governing a newly defined complex EM 2-vector. Subsequently, a further
decomposition of the 1+1+2 formalism into a 1+1+1+1 formalism is developed,
allowing us to decompose the complex EM 2-vector, and its governing equations,
into spin-weighted scalars, giving rise to the generalized BP equations.
"
What are the implications of the non-equivalence between these formulations of general relativity?,"  The purely affine, metric-affine and purely metric formulation of general
relativity are dynamically equivalent and the relation between them is
analogous to the Legendre relation between the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian
dynamics. We show that one cannot construct a dynamically equivalent, purely
affine Lagrangian from a metric-affine or metric F(R) Lagrangian, nonlinear in
the curvature scalar. Thus the equivalence between the purely affine picture
and the two other formulations does not hold for metric-affine and metric
theories of gravity with a nonlinear dependence on the curvature, i.e. F(R)
gravity does not have a purely affine formulation. We also show that this
equivalence is restored if the metric tensor is conformally transformed from
the Jordan to the Einstein frame, in which F(R) gravity turns into general
relativity with a scalar field. This peculiar behavior of general relativity,
among relativistic theories of gravitation, with respect to purely affine,
metric-affine and purely metric variation could indicate the physicality of the
Einstein frame. On the other hand, it could explain why this theory cannot
interpolate among phenomenological behaviors at different scales.
"
What is the definition of the virtual Euler characteristic in the holomorphic case?,"  For a proper scheme X with a fixed 1-perfect obstruction theory, we define
virtual versions of holomorphic Euler characteristic, chi y-genus, and elliptic
genus; they are deformation invariant, and extend the usual definition in the
smooth case. We prove virtual versions of the Grothendieck-Riemann-Roch and
Hirzebruch-Riemann-Roch theorems. We show that the virtual chi y-genus is a
polynomial, and use this to define a virtual topological Euler characteristic.
We prove that the virtual elliptic genus satisfies a Jacobi modularity
property; we state and prove a localization theorem in the toric equivariant
case. We show how some of our results apply to moduli spaces of stable sheaves.
"
What is the proposed inherently parallel algorithm that efficiently performs selection?,"  An inherently parallel algorithm is proposed that efficiently performs
selection: finding the K-th largest member of a set of N members. Selection is
a common component of many more complex algorithms and therefore is a widely
studied problem.
  Not much is new in the proposed dualheap selection algorithm: the heap data
structure is from J.W.J.Williams, the bottom-up heap construction is from R.W.
Floyd, and the concept of a two heap data structure is from J.W.J. Williams and
D.E. Knuth. The algorithm's novelty is limited to a few relatively minor
implementation twists: 1) the two heaps are oriented with their roots at the
partition values rather than at the minimum and maximum values, 2)the coding of
one of the heaps (the heap of smaller values) employs negative indexing, and 3)
the exchange phase of the algorithm is similar to a bottom-up heap
construction, but navigates the heap with a post-order tree traversal.
  When run on a single processor, the dualheap selection algorithm's
performance is competitive with quickselect with median estimation, a common
variant of C.A.R. Hoare's quicksort algorithm. When run on parallel processors,
the dualheap selection algorithm is superior due to its subtasks that are
easily partitioned and innately balanced.
"
How do quantum effects modify the effective potential near the horizon of a Schwarzschild black hole?,"  We discuss massive scalar perturbations of a Schwarzschild black hole. We
argue that quantum effects alter the effective potential near the horizon
resulting in Poincare recurrences in Green functions. Results at the
semi-classical level are independent of the details of the modification of the
potential provided its minimum near the horizon is inversely proportional to
the square of the Poincare time. This modification may be viewed as a change in
the near-horizon geometry. We consider explicitly the examples of a brick wall,
a smooth cutoff and a wormhole-like modification showing that they all lead to
the same results at leading order.
"
How do BMO and L^{\infty} removability relate to the removability of quasiregular mappings?,"  In his celebrated paper on area distortion for quasiconformal mappings,
Astala showed optimal area distortion bounds and dimension distortion estimates
for planar quasiconformal mappings. He asked (Question 4.4) whether a finer
result held, namely absolute continuity of Hausdorff measures under
push-forward by quasiconformal mappings. This was proved in one particular case
relevant for removability questions, in joint work of Astala, Clop, Mateu,
Orobitg and the author (""Distortion of Hausdorff measures and improved
Painlev'e removability for bounded quasiregular mappings"", Duke Math J., to
appear [ACMOU]) (Theorem 1.1), the other cases remaining open. A related
question that we left open in [ACMOU] (Question 4.2) (which was asked by Astala
to the author before [ACMOU] in an equivalent form in a personal communication)
is whether BMO removability for K-quasiregular mappings and ($L^{\infty}$)
removability for K-quasiregular mappings are indeed different problems.
  In this paper we give a series of examples answering in the positive Question
4.2 in [ACMOU], at the same time proving sharpness in two different senses of
Theorem 1.1 in [ACMOU], and also giving examples that would yield sharpness in
those two different senses as well for the absolute continuity of Hausdorff
measures under push-forward by quasiconformal mappings, were it to be proved.
"
What are the possible reasons for the suppression of the optical afterglow in GRB 050410 and GRB 050412?,"  We present a detailed analysis of the prompt and afterglow emission of GRB
050410 and GRB 050412 detected by Swift for which no optical counterpart was
observed. The 15-150 keV energy distribution of the GRB 050410 prompt emission
shows a peak energy at 53 keV. The XRT light curve of this GRB decays as a
power law with a slope of alpha=1.06+/-0.04. The spectrum is well reproduced by
an absorbed power law with a spectral index Gamma_x=2.4+/-0.4 and a low energy
absorption N_H=4(+3;-2)x10^21 cm^(-2) which is higher than the Galactic value.
The 15-150 keV prompt emission in GRB 050412 is modelled with a hard
(Gamma=0.7+/-0.2) power law. The XRT light curve follows a broken power law
with the first slope alpha_1=0.7+/-0.4, the break time T_break=254(-41;+79) s
and the second slope alpha_2=2.8(-0.8;+0.5). The spectrum is fitted by a power
law with spectral index Gamma_x=1.3+/-0.2 which is absorbed at low energies by
the Galactic column. The GRB 050410 afterglow reveals the expected
characteristics of the third component of the canonical Swift light curve.
Conversely, a complex phenomenology was detected in the GRB 050412 because of
the presence of the very early break. The light curve in this case can be
interpreted as being the last peak of the prompt emission. The two bursts
present tight upper limits for the optical emission, however, neither of them
can be clearly classified as dark. For GRB 050410, the suppression of the
optical afterglow could be attributed to a low density interstellar medium
surrounding the burst. For GRB 050412, the evaluation of the darkness is more
difficult due to the ambiguity in the extrapolation of the X-ray afterglow
light curve.
"
What is the relationship between the perturbation operator and the decay of the echo for a system of interacting bosons?,"  We analyze the fidelity decay for a system of interacting bosons described by
a Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian. We find echoes associated with ""non-universal""
structures that dominate the energy landscape of the perturbation operator.
Despite their classical origin, these echoes persist deep into the quantum
(perturbative) regime and can be described by an improved random matrix
modeling. In the opposite limit of strong perturbations (and high enough
energies), classical considerations reveal the importance of self-trapping
phenomena in the echo efficiency.
"
What is the spin valve effect in a ferromagnetic metal/semiconductor hybrid heterostructure?,"  We demonstrate the spin valve effect by ballistic transport in fully
epitaxial MnAs ferromagnetic metal / GaAs semiconductor / GaAs:MnAs granular
hybrid heterostructures. The GaAs:MnAs material contains ferromagnetic MnAs
nanoparticles in a GaAs matrix, and acts as a spin injector and a spin
detector. Although the barrier height of the GaAs/MnAs interface was found to
be very small, relatively large magnetoresistance was observed. This result
shows that by using ballistic transport, we can realize a large spin valve
effect without inserting a high tunnel barrier at the ferromagnetic metal /
semiconductor interface.
"
What are the dual thermal Green function of the 2D free massless scalar field in coordinate space?,"  The Euclidian thermal Green function of the two-dimensional (2D) free
massless scalar field in coordinate space is written as the real part of a
complex analytic function of a variable that conformally maps the infinite
strip $-\infty<x<\infty$ ($0<\tau<\beta$) of the $z=x+i\tau$ ($\tau$: imaginary
time) plane into the upper-half-plane. Using this fact and the Cauchy-Riemann
conditions, we identify the dual thermal Green function as the imaginary part
of that function. Using both the thermal Green function and its dual, we obtain
an explicit series expression for the fermionic correlation functions of the
massive Thirring model (MTM) at a finite temperature.
"
What are the three categories of compact binary systems considered in the gravitational wave search?,"  We report on a search for gravitational waves from the coalescence of compact
binaries during the third and fourth LIGO science runs. The search focused on
gravitational waves generated during the inspiral phase of the binary
evolution. In our analysis, we considered three categories of compact binary
systems, ordered by mass: (i) primordial black hole binaries with masses in the
range 0.35 M(sun) < m1, m2 < 1.0 M(sun), (ii) binary neutron stars with masses
in the range 1.0 M(sun) < m1, m2 < 3.0 M(sun), and (iii) binary black holes
with masses in the range 3.0 M(sun)< m1, m2 < m_(max) with the additional
constraint m1+ m2 < m_(max), where m_(max) was set to 40.0 M(sun) and 80.0
M(sun) in the third and fourth science runs, respectively. Although the
detectors could probe to distances as far as tens of Mpc, no gravitational-wave
signals were identified in the 1364 hours of data we analyzed. Assuming a
binary population with a Gaussian distribution around 0.75-0.75 M(sun), 1.4-1.4
M(sun), and 5.0-5.0 M(sun), we derived 90%-confidence upper limit rates of 4.9
yr^(-1) L10^(-1) for primordial black hole binaries, 1.2 yr^(-1) L10^(-1) for
binary neutron stars, and 0.5 yr^(-1) L10^(-1) for stellar mass binary black
holes, where L10 is 10^(10) times the blue light luminosity of the Sun.
"
"What is the Yang-Mills theory, and how is it derived from the BRST cohomology?","  We present a brief review of the cohomological solutions of self-coupling
interactions of the fields in the free Yang-Mills theory. All consistent
interactions among the fields have been obtained using the antifield formalism
through several order BRST deformations of the master equation. It is found
that the coupling deformations halt exclusively at the second order, whereas
higher order deformations are obstructed due to non-local interactions. The
results demonstrate the BRST cohomological derivation of the interacting
Yang-Mills theory.
"
What is the buckling transition in icosahedral shells?,"  Icosahedral shells undergo a buckling transition as the ratio of Young's
modulus to bending stiffness increases. Strong bending stiffness favors smooth,
nearly spherical shapes, while weak bending stiffness leads to a sharply
faceted icosahedral shape. Based on the phonon spectrum of a simplified
mass-and-spring model of the shell, we interpret the transition from smooth to
faceted as a soft-mode transition. In contrast to the case of a disclinated
planar network where the transition is sharply defined, the mean curvature of
the sphere smooths the transitition. We define elastic susceptibilities as the
response to forces applied at vertices, edges and faces of an icosahedron. At
the soft-mode transition the vertex susceptibility is the largest, but as the
shell becomes more faceted the edge and face susceptibilities greatly exceed
the vertex susceptibility. Limiting behaviors of the susceptibilities are
analyzed and related to the ridge-scaling behavior of elastic sheets. Our
results apply to virus capsids, liposomes with crystalline order and other
shell-like structures with icosahedral symmetry.
"
What is the Yang-Mills theory realized via a nonlinear representation of the gauge group?,"  We propose a subtraction scheme for a massive Yang-Mills theory realized via
a nonlinear representation of the gauge group (here SU(2)). It is based on the
subtraction of the poles in D-4 of the amplitudes, in dimensional
regularization, after a suitable normalization has been performed. Perturbation
theory is in the number of loops and the procedure is stable under iterative
subtraction of the poles. The unphysical Goldstone bosons, the Faddeev-Popov
ghosts and the unphysical mode of the gauge field are expected to cancel out in
the unitarity equation. The spontaneous symmetry breaking parameter is not a
physical variable. We use the tools already tested in the nonlinear sigma
model: hierarchy in the number of Goldstone boson legs and weak power-counting
property (finite number of independent divergent amplitudes at each order). It
is intriguing that the model is naturally based on the symmetry SU(2)_L local
times SU(2)_R global. By construction the physical amplitudes depend on the
mass and on the self-coupling constant of the gauge particle and moreover on
the scale parameter of the radiative corrections. The Feynman rules are in the
Landau gauge.

"What is the significance of the result for the energy equality for the 3D Navier-Stokes equations in the functional class L3([0,T);V^{5/6})?","  We prove that the energy equality holds for weak solutions of the 3D
Navier-Stokes equations in the functional class $L^3([0,T);V^{5/6})$, where
$V^{5/6}$ is the domain of the fractional power of the Stokes operator
$A^{5/12}$.
"
What is the CP-violating Higgs coupling in the most general covariant form?,"  We study possible anomalous CP-violating Higgs couplings to mu mu-bar and t
t-bar fully model-independent way through top-quark pair productions at muon
colliders. Assuming additional non-standard neutral Higgs bosons, whose
couplings with top-quark and muon are expressed in the most general covariant
form, we carry out analyses of effects which they are expected to produce via
CP-violating asymmetries and also the optimal-observable (OO) procedure under
longitudinal and transverse muon polarizations. We find the measurement of the
asymmetry for longitudinal beam polarization could be useful to catch some
signal of CP violation, and an OO analysis might also be useful if we could
reduce the number of unknown parameters with a help of other experiments and if
the size of the parameters is at least O(1) ~ O(10).
"
What is the structure of the clone lattice in a set of size kappa?,"  Let kappa be an uncountable regular cardinal. Assuming 2^kappa=kappa^+, we
show that the clone lattice on a set of size kappa is not dually atomic.
"
What is the relationship between the probability distribution of conformations of a fluctuating chain and the partition function of a field theory?,"  In this work the dynamics of a freely jointed random chain which fluctuates
at constant temperature in some viscous medium is studied. The chain is
regarded as a system of small particles which perform a brownian motion and are
subjected to rigid constraints which forbid the breaking of the chain. For
simplicity, all interactions among the particles have been switched off and the
number of dimensions has been limited to two. The problem of describing the
fluctuations of the chain in the limit in which it becomes a continuous system
is solved using a path integral approach, in which the constraints are imposed
with the insertion in the path integral of suitable Dirac delta functions. It
is shown that the probability distribution of the possible conformations in
which the fluctuating chain can be found during its evolution in time coincides
with the partition function of a field theory which is a generalization of the
nonlinear sigma model in two dimensions. Both the probability distribution and
the generating functional of the correlation functions of the positions of the
beads are computed explicitly in a semiclassical approximation for a
ring-shaped chain.
"
What are the spatial profiles of the modes localized on the order of the lattice spacing?,"  Experimental evidence for the generation of intrinsic localized modes (ILMs)
in a nonlinear electrical transmission line is presented both via modulational
instability (MI) of the uniform mode and via driving the lattice locally. The
spatial profiles of these modes localized on the order of the lattice spacing
can be directly measured in this macroscopic lattice, in contrast to most other
systems where ILMs have so far been detected.
"
What is the Mertens product for arithmetic progressions?,"  The aim of the paper is the proof of new identities for the constant in the
Mertens product for arithmetic progressions. We deal with the problem of the
numerical computation of these constants in another paper.
"
What is the amplitude ratio of the oscillations in sunspot regions compared to the quiet Sun?,"  Five-minute oscillations on the Sun (acoustic and surface gravity waves) are
excited by subsurface turbulent convection. However, in sunspots the excitation
is suppressed because strong magnetic field inhibits convection. We use 3D
simulations to investigate how the suppression of excitation sources affects
the distribution of the oscillation power in sunspot regions. The amplitude of
random acoustic sources was reduced in circular-shaped regions to simulate the
suppression in sunspots. The simulation results show that the amplitude of the
oscillations can be approximately 2-4 times lower in the sunspot regions in
comparison to the quiet Sun, just because of the suppressed sources. Using
SOHO/MDI data we measured the amplitude ratio for the same frequency bands
outside and inside sunspots, and found that this ratio is approximately 3-4.
Hence, the absence of excitation sources inside sunspots makes a significant
contribution (about 50% or higher) to the observed amplitude ratio and must be
taken into account in sunspot seismology.
"
What is the order parameter in the three-dimensional XY model with a Z_q anisotropic term?,"  We study the three-dimensional XY model with a Z_q anisotropic term. At
temperatures T < Tc this dangerously irrelevant perturbation is relevant only
above a length scale Lambda, which diverges as a power of the correlation
length; Lambda ~ xi^a_q. Below Lambda the order parameter is U(1) symmetric. We
derive the full scaling function controlling the emergence of U(1) symmetry and
use Monte Carlo results to extract the exponent a_q for q=4,...,8. We find that
a_q = a_4 (q/4)^2, with a_4 only marginally larger than 1. We discuss these
results in the context of U(1) symmetry at ""deconfined"" quantum critical points
separating antiferromagnetic and valence-bond-solid states in quantum spin
systems.
"
How can the Lorentz factor be calculated from a 2D Minkowski spacetime diagram?,"  A two-dimensional Minkowski spacetime diagram is neatly represented on a
Euclidean ordinary plane. However the Euclidean lengths of the lines on the
diagram do not correspond to the true values of physical quantities in
spacetime, except for those referring to the stationary reference frame. In
order to extend its abilities to other inertial reference frames, we derive a
factor which, multiplied by the magnitude of the actually displayed values (on
the diagram), leads to the corresponding true measured values by any other
inertial observers. Doing so, the student can infer from the Euclidean diagram
plot the expressions that account for Lorentz length contraction, time dilation
and also Lorentz Transformations just by using regular trigonometry.
"
What are the control laws used to compensate for dispersions in quantum system dynamics?,"  Finding control laws (pulse sequences) that can compensate for dispersions in
parameters which govern the evolution of a quantum system is an important
problem in the fields of coherent spectroscopy, imaging, and quantum
information processing. The use of composite pulse techniques for such tasks
has a long and widely known history. In this paper, we introduce the method of
Fourier synthesis control law design for compensating dispersions in quantum
system dynamics. We focus on system models arising in NMR spectroscopy and NMR
imaging applications.
"
What are the morphological measures used to analyze the ISW effect?,"  Using local morphological measures on the sphere defined through a steerable
wavelet analysis, we examine the three-year WMAP and the NVSS data for
correlation induced by the integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect. The steerable
wavelet constructed from the second derivative of a Gaussian allows one to
define three local morphological measures, namely the signed-intensity,
orientation and elongation of local features. Detections of correlation between
the WMAP and NVSS data are made with each of these morphological measures. The
most significant detection is obtained in the correlation of the
signed-intensity of local features at a significance of 99.9%. By inspecting
signed-intensity sky maps, it is possible for the first time to see the
correlation between the WMAP and NVSS data by eye. Foreground contamination and
instrumental systematics in the WMAP data are ruled out as the source of all
significant detections of correlation. Our results provide new insight on the
ISW effect by probing the morphological nature of the correlation induced
between the cosmic microwave background and large scale structure of the
Universe. Given the current constraints on the flatness of the Universe, our
detection of the ISW effect again provides direct and independent evidence for
dark energy. Moreover, this new morphological analysis may be used in future to
help us to better understand the nature of dark energy.
"
What are the kinetic equations representing coadjoint motion under canonical transformations?,"  A new symplectic variational approach is developed for modeling dissipation
in kinetic equations. This approach yields a double bracket structure in phase
space which generates kinetic equations representing coadjoint motion under
canonical transformations. The Vlasov example admits measure-valued
single-particle solutions. Such solutions are reversible; and the total entropy
is a Casimir, and thus is preserved.
"
What is the thermal Green function of the 2D free massless scalar field in coordinate space?,"  The Euclidian thermal Green function of the two-dimensional (2D) free
massless scalar field in coordinate space is written as the real part of a
complex analytic function of a variable that conformally maps the infinite
strip $-\infty<x<\infty$ ($0<\tau<\beta$) of the $z=x+i\tau$ ($\tau$: imaginary
time) plane into the upper-half-plane. Using this fact and the Cauchy-Riemann
conditions, we identify the dual thermal Green function as the imaginary part
of that function. Using both the thermal Green function and its dual, we obtain
an explicit series expression for the fermionic correlation functions of the
massive Thirring model (MTM) at a finite temperature.
"
What are the Nash equilibria in the Prisoner's Dilemma when joint probabilities are non-factorizable?,"  A probabilistic framework is developed that gives a unifying perspective on
both the classical and the quantum games. We suggest exploiting peculiar
probabilities involved in Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) experiments to
construct quantum games. In our framework a game attains classical
interpretation when joint probabilities are factorizable and a quantum game
corresponds when these probabilities cannot be factorized. We analyze how
non-factorizability changes Nash equilibria in two-player games while
considering the games of Prisoner's Dilemma, Stag Hunt, and Chicken. In this
framework we find that for the game of Prisoner's Dilemma even non-factorizable
EPR joint probabilities cannot be helpful to escape from the classical outcome
of the game. For a particular version of the Chicken game, however, we find
that the two non-factorizable sets of joint probabilities, that maximally
violates the Clauser-Holt-Shimony-Horne (CHSH) sum of correlations, indeed
result in new Nash equilibria.
"
What is the sharp Lp estimate for a singular Radon transform?,"  We prove a sharp Lp estimate for a singular Radon transform according to a
size condition of its kernel, which is useful for extrapolation.
"
What are the signatures of supersymmetry at the LHCb experiment?,"  The spectrum of supersymmetric theories with R-parity violation are much more
weakly constrained than that of supersymmetric theories with a stable
neutralino. We investigate the signatures of supersymmetry at the LHCb
experiment in the region of parameter space where the neutralino decay leaves a
displaced vertex. We find sensitivity to squark production up to squark masses
of order 1 TeV. We note that if the Higgs decays to neutralinos in this
scenario, LHCb should see the lightest Higgs boson before ATLAS and CMS.
"
What is the nature of the periodic motion in a neighborhood of the solutions?,"  We reformulate the Gross-Pitaevskii equation with an external parabolic
potential as a discrete dynamical system, by using the basis of Hermite
functions. We consider small amplitude stationary solutions with a single node,
called dark solitons, and examine their existence and linear stability.
Furthermore, we prove the persistence of a periodic motion in a neighborhood of
such solutions. Our results are corroborated by numerical computations
elucidating the existence, linear stability and dynamics of the relevant
solutions.
"
What is the relationship between the elliptic Gauss sum and the quartic residue character mod π?,"  The rationality of the elliptic Gauss sum coefficient is shown. The following
is a specific case of our argument.
  Let f(u)=sl((1-i)\varpi u), where sl() is the Gauss' lemniscatic sine and
\varpi=2.62205... is the real period of the elliptic curve y^2=x^3-x, so that
f(u) is an elliptic function relative to the period lattice Z[i].
  Let \pi be a primary prime of Z[i] such that norm(\pi)\equiv 13\mod 16. Let S
be the quarter set mod \pi consisting of quartic residues.
  Let us define G(\pi):=\sum_{\nu\in S} f(\nu/\pi) and
\tilde{\pi}:=\prod_{\nu\in S} f(\nu/\pi).
  The former G(\pi) is a typical example of elliptic Gauss sum; the latter is
regarded as a canonical 4-th root of -\pi: (\tilde{\pi})^4=-\pi. Then we have
  Theorem: G(\pi)/(\tilde{\pi})^3 is a rational odd integer.
  G(\pi) appears naturally in the central value of Hecke L associated to the
quartic residue character mod \pi, and our proof is based on the functional
equation of L and an explicit formula of the root number. In fact, the latter
is nothing but the Cassels-Matthews formula on the quartic Gauss sum.
"
How is the 4D force in the rest frame of the dipole not equal to the 3D force in the rest frame of the dipole?,"  The interaction of the electric and magnetic dipole moments of a particle
with the electromagnetic field is investigated in an approach that deals with
four-dimensional (4D) geometric quantities. The new commutation relations for
the 4D orbital and intrinsic angular momentums and also for the 4D dipole
moments are introduced. The expectation value of the quantum 4-force, which
holds in any frame, is worked out in terms of them. In contrast to it the whole
calculation in [1] ([1] J. Anandan, Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{85}, 1354 (2000))
has been made only in the rest frame of the dipole. It is proved that, e.g.,
the expression for the 3D force $\mathbf{f}%_{S}$ in [1] is not
relativistically correct and that the quantum 4-force is not zero in the
experiments proposed in [1]. This means that the phase shifts that could be
observed in such experiments are not topological phase shifts.
"
What are the symmetric form of the $D_4^{(1)}$-symmetries in the 4-parameter family?,"  In this paper, we propose a 4-parameter family of coupled Painlev\'e III
systems in dimension four with affine Weyl group symmetry of type $D_4^{(1)}$.
We also propose its symmetric form in which the $D_4^{(1)}$-symmetries become
clearly visible.
"
What is the method for perturbing selfdual functionals to induce coercivity and compactness?,"  Selfdual variational calculus is further refined and used to address
questions of existence of local and global solutions for various parabolic
semi-linear equations, Hamiltonian systems of PDEs, as well as certain
nonlinear Schrodinger evolutions. This allows for the resolution of such
equations under general time boundary conditions which include the more
traditional ones such as initial value problems, periodic and anti-periodic
orbits, but also yield new ones such as ""periodic orbits up to an isometry"" for
evolution equations that may not have periodic solutions. In the process, we
introduce a method for perturbing selfdual functionals in order to induce
coercivity and compactness, while keeping the system selfdual.
"
"What is the giant pulses generated in a set of fine, unequally spaced, narrow emission bands?","  We propose that Crab giant pulses are generated on closed magnetic field
lines near the light cylinder via anomalous cyclotron resonance on the ordinary
mode. Waves are generated in a set of fine, unequally spaced, narrow emission
bands at frequencies much lower than a local cyclotron frequency. Location of
emission bands is fitted to spectral structures seen by Eilek et al. (2006).
  To reproduce the data, the required density of plasma in the giant pulses
emission region is much higher, by a factor $\sim 3 \times 10^5$, than the
minimal Goldreich-Julian density. Emission is generated by a population of
highly energetic particles with radiation-limited Lorentz factors $\gamma \sim
7 \times 10^7$, produced during occasional reconnection close to the Y point,
where the last closed field lines approach the light cylinder.
"
What is the framework of regularization in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space?,"  The distance metric plays an important role in nearest neighbor (NN)
classification. Usually the Euclidean distance metric is assumed or a
Mahalanobis distance metric is optimized to improve the NN performance. In this
paper, we study the problem of embedding arbitrary metric spaces into a
Euclidean space with the goal to improve the accuracy of the NN classifier. We
propose a solution by appealing to the framework of regularization in a
reproducing kernel Hilbert space and prove a representer-like theorem for NN
classification. The embedding function is then determined by solving a
semidefinite program which has an interesting connection to the soft-margin
linear binary support vector machine classifier. Although the main focus of
this paper is to present a general, theoretical framework for metric embedding
in a NN setting, we demonstrate the performance of the proposed method on some
benchmark datasets and show that it performs better than the Mahalanobis metric
learning algorithm in terms of leave-one-out and generalization errors.
"
How does the new cut-free sequent calculus for bi-intuitionistic logic ensure its completeness?,"  Bi-intuitionistic logic is the extension of intuitionistic logic with a
connective dual to implication. Bi-intuitionistic logic was introduced by
Rauszer as a Hilbert calculus with algebraic and Kripke semantics. But her
subsequent ``cut-free'' sequent calculus for BiInt has recently been shown by
Uustalu to fail cut-elimination. We present a new cut-free sequent calculus for
BiInt, and prove it sound and complete with respect to its Kripke semantics.
Ensuring completeness is complicated by the interaction between implication and
its dual, similarly to future and past modalities in tense logic. Our calculus
handles this interaction using extended sequents which pass information from
premises to conclusions using variables instantiated at the leaves of failed
derivation trees. Our simple termination argument allows our calculus to be
used for automated deduction, although this is not its main purpose.
"
What is the spectral class of the bright supergiant in the RY Scuti binary system?,"  The massive interacting binary RY Scuti is an important representative of an
active mass-transferring system that is changing before our eyes and which may
be an example of the formation of a Wolf-Rayet star through tidal stripping.
Utilizing new and previously published spectra, we present examples of how a
number of illustrative absorption and emission features vary during the binary
orbit. We identify spectral features associated with each component, calculate
a new, double-lined spectroscopic binary orbit, and find masses of 7.1 +/- 1.2
M_sun for the bright supergiant and 30.0 +/- 2.1 M_sun for the hidden massive
companion. Through tomographic reconstruction of the component spectra from the
composite spectra, we confirm the O9.7 Ibpe spectral class of the bright
supergiant and discover a B0.5 I spectrum associated with the hidden massive
companion; however, we suggest that the latter is actually the spectrum of the
photosphere of the accretion torus immediately surrounding the massive
companion. We describe the complex nature of the mass loss flows from the
system in the context of recent hydrodynamical models for beta Lyr, leading us
to conclude RY Scuti has matter leaving the system in two ways: 1) a bipolar
outflow from winds generated by the hidden massive companion, and 2) mass from
the bright O9.7 Ibpe supergiant flowing from the region near the L2 point to
fill out a large, dense circumbinary disk. This circumbinary disk (radius ~ 1
AU) may feed the surrounding double-toroidal nebula (radius ~ 2000 AU).
"
What is the bound of the rank of the derived subgroup of a finite group?,"  Let $G$ be a finite group with derived subgroup of rank $r$. We prove that
$\gzz\leq |G'|^{2r}$. Motivated by the results of I. M. Isaacs in \cite{isa} we
show that if $G$ is capable then $\gz\leq |G'|^{4r}$. This answers a question
of L. Pyber. We prove that if $G$ is a capable $p$-group then the rank of
$G/\mathbf{Z}(G)$ is bounded above in terms of the rank of $G'$.
"
What is the sum S_\gamma(n)+n formed as an alternating binomial series from the Stieltjes constants?,"  We present a variety of series representations of the Stieltjes and related
constants, the Stieltjes constants being the coefficients of the Laurent
expansion of the Hurwitz zeta function zeta(s,a) about s=1. Additionally we
obtain series and integral representations of a sum S_\gamma(n) formed as an
alternating binomial series from the Stieltjes constants. The slowly varying
sum S_\gamma(n)+n is an important subsum in application of the Li criterion for
the Riemann hypothesis.
"
What is the Boolean network model of the cell-cycle regulatory network of fission yeast?,"  A Boolean network model of the cell-cycle regulatory network of fission yeast
(Schizosaccharomyces Pombe) is constructed solely on the basis of the known
biochemical interaction topology. Simulating the model in the computer,
faithfully reproduces the known sequence of regulatory activity patterns along
the cell cycle of the living cell. Contrary to existing differential equation
models, no parameters enter the model except the structure of the regulatory
circuitry. The dynamical properties of the model indicate that the biological
dynamical sequence is robustly implemented in the regulatory network, with the
biological stationary state G1 corresponding to the dominant attractor in state
space, and with the biological regulatory sequence being a strongly attractive
trajectory. Comparing the fission yeast cell-cycle model to a similar model of
the corresponding network in S. cerevisiae, a remarkable difference in
circuitry, as well as dynamics is observed. While the latter operates in a
strongly damped mode, driven by external excitation, the S. pombe network
represents an auto-excited system with external damping.
"
What are the key steps to construct a planar semimodular lattice?,"  We construct all planar semimodular lattices in three simple steps from the
direct product of two chains.
"
How do lunar precession and surface charging impact the lunar environment?,"  This paper shows how the exposure of the Moon to the Earth's plasmasheet is
subject to decadal variations due to lunar precession. The latter is a key
property of the Moon's apparent orbit around the Earth - the nodes of that
orbit precess around the ecliptic, completing one revolution every 18.6 years.
This precession is responsible for a number of astronomical phenomena, e.g. the
year to year drift of solar and lunar eclipse periods. It also controls the
ecliptic latitude at which the Moon crosses the magnetotail and thus the number
and duration of lunar encounters with the plasmasheet. This paper presents a
detailed model of those encounters and applies it to the period 1960 to 2030.
This shows that the total lunar exposure to the plasmasheet will vary from 10
hours per month at a minimum of the eighteen-year cycle rising to 40 hours per
month at the maximum. These variations could have a profound impact on the
accumulation of charge due plasmasheet electrons impacting the lunar surface.
Thus we should expect the level of lunar surface charging to vary over the
eighteen-year cycle. The literature contains reports that support this: several
observations made during the cycle maximum of 1994-2000 are attributed to
bombardment and charging of the lunar surface by plasmasheet electrons. Thus we
conclude that lunar surface charging will vary markedly over an eighteen-year
cycle driven by lunar precession. It is important to interpret lunar
environment measurements in the context of this cycle and to allow for the
cycle when designing equipment for deployment on the lunar surface. This is
particularly important in respect of developing plans for robotic exploration
on the lunar surface during the next cycle maximum of 2012-19.
"
What are the implications of the limiting distribution for the free path length of the Lorentz gas?,"  The periodic Lorentz gas describes the dynamics of a point particle in a
periodic array of spherical scatterers, and is one of the fundamental models
for chaotic diffusion. In the present paper we investigate the Boltzmann-Grad
limit, where the radius of each scatterer tends to zero, and prove the
existence of a limiting distribution for the free path length of the periodic
Lorentz gas. We also discuss related problems, such as the statistical
distribution of directions of lattice points that are visible from a fixed
position.
"
What is the issue of moduli stabilization in N=1 four-dimensional supergravity theories?,"  We revisit the issue of moduli stabilization in a class of N=1 four
dimensional supergravity theories which are low energy descriptions of standard
perturbative heterotic string vacua compactified on Calabi-Yau spaces. In
particular, we show how it is possible to stabilize the universal dilaton and
Kahler moduli in a de Sitter/Minkowski vacuum with low energy supersymmetry
breaking by means of non-perturbative gauge dynamics, including recent results
by Intriligator, Seiberg and Shih. The non-SUSY vacua are meta-stable but
sufficiently long-lived.
"
What are the implications of the similarities and differences between the WASP-1 and HD 149026 systems?,"  In this paper we present our results of a comprehensive spectroscopicanalysis
of WASP-1, the host star to the exoplanet WASP-1b. We derive T_eff = 6110 +/-
45 K, log g = 4.28 +/- 0.15, and [M/H] = 0.23 +/- 0.08, and also a high
abundance of lithium, log n(Li) = 2.91 +/- 0.05. These parameters suggests an
age for the system of 1-3 Gyr and a stellar mass of 1.25-1.35 M_sun. This means
that WASP-1 has properties very similar to those of HD 149026, the host star
for the highest density planet yet detected. Moreover, their planets orbit at
comparable distances and receive comparable irradiating fluxes from their host
stars. However, despite the similarity of WASP-1 with HD 149026, their planets
have strongly different densities. This suggests that gas-giant planet density
is not a simple function of host-star metallicity or of radiation environment
at ages of ~2 Gyr.
"
What are the features of the ballistic transport in the presence of a scattering center in graphene?,"  We theoretically propose to directly observe the chiral nature of charge
carriers in graphene mono- and bilayers within a controlled scattering
experiment. The charge located on a capacitively coupled scanning probe
microscope (SPM) tip acts as a scattering center with controllable position on
the graphene sheet. Unambiguous features from the chirality of the particles in
single and bilayer graphene arise in the ballistic transport in the presence of
such a scattering center. To theoretically model the scattering from the smooth
potential created by the SPM tip, we develop the scattering formalism within
first-order Born approximation. We calculate the current through a device with
an SPM tip between two constrictions (quantum point contacts) as a function of
the tip position.
"
What is the perturbative generation of instantons in the context of D-branes?,"  Non-perturbative D-brane instantons can generate perturbatively absent though
phenomenologically relevant couplings for Type II orientifold compactifications
with D-branes. We discuss the generation of the perturbatively vanishing SU(5)
GUT Yukawa coupling of type 10 10 5_H. Moreover, for a simple globally
consistent intersecting D6-brane model, we discuss the generation of mass terms
for matter fields. This can serve as a mechanism for decoupling exotic matter.
"
What are the multiplicative and additive groups of some rings?,"  We give a general exposition of model theoretic connected components of
groups. We show that if a group G has NIP, then there exists the smallest
invariant (over some small set) subgroup of G with bounded index (Theorem 5.3).
This result extends theorem of Shelah. We consider also in this context the
multiplicative and the additive groups of some rings (including infite fields).
"
What are the electromagnetic form factors of the exotic baryons calculated in the relativistic quark model at small and intermediate momentum transfer?,"  The electromagnetic form factors of the exotic baryons are calculated in the
framework of the relativistic quark model at small and intermediate momentum
transfer. The charge radii of the E+++ baryons are determined.
"
What are the implications of the Composite Model for the origin of CP violation in particle interactions?,"  A fermion-boson-type Composite Model is proposed.
  Elementary fields are only one kind of spin-1/2 and spin-0 {\bf preon}. Both
are in the global supersymmetric pair with the common electric charge of e/6
and belong to the fundamental representations of (3, 2, 2) under the
spontaneously unbroken SU(3)_C\otimes{SU(2)}_L^{h}\otimes{SU(2)}_R^{h} gauge
symmetry (h means hyper-color gauge). Preons are composed into subquarks which
are intermediate clusters towards quarks and leptons. Weak interactions are
residual ones of hyper-color gauge interactions. W-and Z-boson are also
composite objects of subquarks, which introduces the idea of existence of their
scalar partners (S) by hyper-fine-splitting whose masses would be around
110-120 GeV. The mechanism of making higher generations is obtained by adding
neutral scalar subquark (y) composed of a preon-antipreon pair. Creation or
annihilation of y inside quarks induces the coupling constants of flavor-mixing
weak interactions which are all complex numbers (contrary to CKM-matrix
elements) and then they all become sources of direct and mixing-induced CP
violations. Exchange of y between quark and anti-quark inside neutral
pseudo-scalar meson (P^0) gives indirect CP violation and mass-difference of
P^0 and P^0. Current experimental results of CP violation (Belle, BaBar, CLEO,
KTeV and NA48) are inspected by this Composite Model. This model suggests the
candidates for Dark Energy and Dark Matter.
"
What are the hierarchy of intersection rigidity properties of sets in a closed symplectic manifold?,"  We show that there is an hierarchy of intersection rigidity properties of
sets in a closed symplectic manifold: some sets cannot be displaced by
symplectomorphisms from more sets than the others. We also find new examples of
rigidity of intersections involving, in particular, specific fibers of moment
maps of Hamiltonian torus actions, monotone Lagrangian submanifolds (following
the works of P.Albers and P.Biran-O.Cornea), as well as certain, possibly
singular, sets defined in terms of Poisson-commutative subalgebras of smooth
functions. In addition, we get some geometric obstructions to semi-simplicity
of the quantum homology of symplectic manifolds. The proofs are based on the
Floer-theoretical machinery of partial symplectic quasi-states.
"
What is the lower bound of the Riemann zeta-function averaged over the non-trivial zeros?,"  Assuming the Riemann Hypothesis, we establish lower bounds for moments of the
derivative of the Riemann zeta-function averaged over the non-trivial zeros of
$\zeta(s)$. Our proof is based upon a recent method of Rudnick and
Soundararajan that provides analogous bounds for moments of $L$-functions at
the central point, averaged over families.
"
What is the cosmological implication of B-L symmetry with and without supersymmetry?,"  We discuss some cosmological implications of low energy gauged B-L symmetry
with and without supersymmetry. Generic possibility of leptogenesis from a
domain wall driven first order phase transition is shown to be a characteristic
of such models.
"
What are the conditions for zero-lag isochronous synchronization in coupled systems?,"  In a recent letter, Fisher et al. reported the phenomenon of zero-lag long
range isochronous synchronization via dynamical relaying in systems with delay
[Phys. Rev. Lett. bf 97, 123902 (2006)]. They reported that when one has two
coupled systems A and C, with delay between them, then the introduction of a
third element B between A and C will allow them to synchronize even in regions
of the parameter space where this was not possible without the presence of B.
Here we study in detail the phenomenon and verify that in all the cases studied
(including the ones reported by Fisher et al.) this occurs due to the tendency
of A and B and B and C to be in antiphase synchronization and if A is in
antiphase with B and B is in antiphase with C, it will imply that A and C are
inphase. We show this in coupled quadratic maps, Kuramoto and R\""ossler
oscillators. We also report that there is a simpler configuration where the
same phenomenon occurs and has nearly the same features of the cases studied by
Fisher et al.
"
What is the information that distributions of the Theta+ in experiments can provide about the properties of hadron remnants in hard processes?,"  To understand the whole set of positive and null data on the
Theta+(1530)-production, we suggest the hypothesis that multiquark hadrons are
mainly generated from many-quark states, which emerge either as short-term
hadron fluctuations, or as hadron remnants in hard processes. This approach
allows us to describe both non-observation of the Theta+ in current null
experiments and peculiar features of its production in positive experiments.
Further, we are able to propose new experiments that might be decisive for the
problem of the Theta+ existence. Distributions of the Theta+ in such
experiments can give important information both on higher Fock components of
conventional hadrons and about structure and hadronization properties of hadron
remnants produced in hard processes. We also explain that description of
multiquark hadrons may require a modified form of the constituent quark model,
with quark masses and couplings being intermediate between their values for the
familiar constituent quarks and the current ones.
"
What is the relationship between the baryon asymmetry of the Universe and the Standard Model with three hierarchical neutrinos?,"  If the baryon asymmetry of the Universe is produced by leptogenesis, CP
violation is required in the lepton sector. In the seesaw extension of the
Standard Model with three hierarchical right-handed neutrinos, we show that the
baryon asymmetry is insensitive to the PMNS phases: thermal leptogenesis can
work for any value of the observable phases. This result was well-known when
there are no flavour effects in leptogenesis; we show that it remains true when
flavour effects are included.
"
What is the time and space complexity of the algorithm?,"  Hypervolume indicator is a commonly accepted quality measure for comparing
Pareto approximation set generated by multi-objective optimizers. The best
known algorithm to calculate it for $n$ points in $d$-dimensional space has a
run time of $O(n^{d/2})$ with special data structures. This paper presents a
recursive, vertex-splitting algorithm for calculating the hypervolume indicator
of a set of $n$ non-comparable points in $d>2$ dimensions. It splits out
multiple child hyper-cuboids which can not be dominated by a splitting
reference point. In special, the splitting reference point is carefully chosen
to minimize the number of points in the child hyper-cuboids. The complexity
analysis shows that the proposed algorithm achieves $O((\frac{d}{2})^n)$ time
and $O(dn^2)$ space complexity in the worst case.
"
Can the Markov-switching multifractal model capture the temporal dependence of financial data?,"  In this paper, we consider daily financial data of a collection of different
stock market indices, exchange rates, and interest rates, and we analyze their
multi-scaling properties by estimating a simple specification of the
Markov-switching multifractal model (MSM). In order to see how well the
estimated models capture the temporal dependence of the data, we estimate and
compare the scaling exponents $H(q)$ (for $q = 1, 2$) for both empirical data
and simulated data of the estimated MSM models. In most cases the multifractal
model appears to generate `apparent' long memory in agreement with the
empirical scaling laws.
"
What are the canonical structures of the plane and their relation to the rings of integers?,"  The \emph{canonical structures of the plane} are those that result, up to
isomorphism, from the rings that have the form $\mathds{R}[x]/(ax^2+bx+c)$ with
$a\neq 0$.That ring is isomorphic to $\mathds{R}[\theta]$, where $\theta$ is
the equivalence class of x, which satisfies $\theta^2 = (-\dfrac{c}{a}) +
\theta (-\dfrac{b}{a})$. On the other hand, it is known that, up to
isomorphism, there are only three canonical structures: the corresponding to
$\theta^2 = -1$ (the complex numbers), $\theta^2 = 1$ (the perplex or
hyperbolic numbers) and $\theta^2 = 0$ (the parabolic numbers). This article
copes with the algebraic structure of the rings of integers
$\mathds{Z}[\theta]$ in the perplex and parabolic cases by \emph{analogy} to
the complex cases: the ring of Gaussian integers. For those rings a
\emph{division algorithm} is proved and it is obtained, as a consequence, the
characterization of the prime and irreducible elements.
"
What are the implications of the L-S boundary for the existence of a localized Bose-Einstein condensation state in a nanoporous glass?,"  We have studied the liquid - solid (L-S) phase transition of ^4He confined in
nanoporous glass, which has interconnected nanopores of 2.5 nm in diameter. The
L-S boundary is determined by the measurements of pressure and thermal response
during slow cooling and warming. Below 1 K, the freezing pressure is elevated
to 1.2 MPa from the bulk freezing pressure, and appears to be independent of
temperature. The T-independent L-S boundary implies the existence of a
localized Bose-Einstein condensation state, in which long-range superfluid
coherence is destroyed by narrowness of the nanopores and random potential.
"
What are the advantages of the proposed algorithm in terms of security and complexity?,"  Security of information has become a major issue during the last decades. New
algorithms based on chaotic maps were suggested for protection of different
types of multimedia data, especially digital images and videos in this period.
However, many of them fundamentally were flawed by a lack of robustness and
security. For getting higher security and higher complexity, in the current
paper, we introduce a new kind of symmetric key block cipher algorithm that is
based on \emph{tripled chaotic maps}. In this algorithm, the utilization of two
coupling parameters, as well as the increased complexity of the cryptosystem,
make a contribution to the development of cryptosystem with higher security. In
order to increase the security of the proposed algorithm, the size of key space
and the computational complexity of the coupling parameters should be increased
as well. Both the theoretical and experimental results state that the proposed
algorithm has many capabilities such as acceptable speed and complexity in the
algorithm due to the existence of two coupling parameter and high security.
Note that the ciphertext has a flat distribution and has the same size as the

What is the functor \Phi associated with the distributive lattice L?,"  The ordering relation of a bounded distributive lattice L is a (distributive)
(0, 1)-sublattice of L \times L. This construction gives rise to a functor \Phi
from the category of bounded distributive lattices to itself. We examine the
interaction of \Phi with Priestley duality and characterise those bounded
distributive lattices L such that there is a bounded distributive lattice K
such that \Phi(K) is (isomorphic to) L.
"
What are the observations made using the CANGAROO-III stereoscopic system for the TeV energy region?,"  We have observed the giant radio galaxy Centaurus A and the globular cluster
$\omega$ Centauri in the TeV energy region using the CANGAROO-III stereoscopic
system. The system has been in operation since 2004 withan array of four
Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACT) with $\sim$100-m spacings. The
observations were carried out in March and April 2004. In total, approximately
10 hours data were obtained for each target.No statistically significant
gamma-ray signal has been found above 420 GeV over a wide angular region (a
one-degree radius from thepointing center) and we derive flux upper limits
using all of the field of view.Implications for the total energy of cosmic rays
and the density of the cold dark matter are considered.
"
What are the dynamics of co-evolution of producers and customers described by bit-strings representing individual traits?,"  We study the dynamics of co-evolution of producers and customers described by
bit-strings representing individual traits. Individual ''size-like'' properties
are controlled by binary encounters which outcome depends upon a recognition
process. Depending upon the parameter set-up, mutual selection of producers and
customers results in different types of attractors, either an exclusive niches
regime or a competition regime.
"
What are the Kolmogorov's type of construction associated with a sub-factor of type-II_1 factor?,"  In this paper we consider a semigroup of completely positive maps
$\tau=(\tau_t,t \ge 0)$ with a faithful normal invariant state $\phi$ on a
type-$II_1$ factor $\cla_0$ and propose an index theory. We :achieve this via a
more general Kolmogorov's type of construction for stationary Markov processes
which naturally associate a nested isomorphic von-Neumann algebras. In
particular this construction generalizes well known Jones construction
associated with a sub-factor of type-II$_1$ factor.
"
What are the prime factors of an integer and their relation to the measure of irrationality?,"  We give a simple geometric proof that $e$ is irrational, using a construction
of a nested sequence of closed intervals with intersection $e$. The proof leads
to a new measure of irrationality for $e$: if $p$ and $q$ are integers with $q
> 1$, then $|e - p/q| > 1/(S(q)+1)!$, where $S(q)$ is the smallest positive
integer such that $S(q)!$ is a multiple of $q$. We relate this measure for $e$
to a known one and to the greatest prime factor of an integer. We make two
conjectures and recall a theorem of Cantor that can be proved by a similar
construction.
"
What is the forward ansatz in the DGLAP region used to model generalised parton distributions?,"  We present a model of generalised parton distributions based on a forward
ansatz in the DGLAP region. We discuss some aspects of the parametrisations, as
the dependence in t, with factorised and non-factorised approaches, where t is
the square of the four-momentum exchanged at the hadron vertex. The predictions
of this model are then compared with DVCS cross sections from H1 and ZEUS, and
a related observable, the skewing factor, defined as the following ratio
imaginary amplitudes : $R \equiv {Im {\cal A} (\gamma^*+p \to \gamma
+p)\lfrestriction{t=0}} / {Im {\cal A} (\gamma^*+p \to \gamma^*
+p)\lfrestriction{t=0}}$. It is an interesting quantity including both the
non-forward kinematics and the non-diagonal effects. Finally, we discuss the
beam charge asymmetry, which is certainly the most sensitive observable to the
different hypothesis needed in the GPDs parametrisations. We show that the
approximations done for the t dependence lead to significant differences for
the predictions in the HERMES kinematic domain and prospects are given for
COMPASS.
"
What is the localization of single-particle states in optical lattices with a disorder potential generated via a secondary species frozen in random configurations?,"  We investigate the behavior of ultracold bosons in optical lattices with a
disorder potential generated via a secondary species frozen in random
configurations. The statistics of disorder is associated with the physical
state in which the secondary species is prepared. The resulting random
potential, albeit displaying algebraic correlations, is found to lead to
localization of all single-particle states. We then investigate the real-time
dynamics of localization for a hardcore gas of mobile bosons which are brought
into sudden interaction with the random potential. Regardless of their initial
state and for any disorder strength, the mobile particles are found to reach a
steady state characterized by exponentially decaying off-diagonal correlations
and by the absence of quasi-condensation; when the mobile particles are
initially confined in a tight trap and then released in the disorder potential,
their expansion is stopped and the steady state is exponentially localized in
real space, clearly revealing Anderson localization.
"
How do the observed velocity gradients across the cores relate to the specific angular momenta of the protostellar cores?,"  We present the results of an interferometric study of the N2H+(1--0) emission
from nine nearby, isolated, low-mass protostellar cores, using the OVRO
millimeter array. The main goal of this study is the kinematic characterization
of the cores in terms of rotation, turbulence, and fragmentation. Eight of the
nine objects have compact N2H+ cores with FWHM radii of 1200 -- 3500 AU,
spatially coinciding with the thermal dust continuum emission. The only more
evolved (Class I) object in the sample (CB 188) shows only faint and extended
N2H+ emission. The mean N2H+ line width was found to be 0.37 km/s. Estimated
virial masses range from 0.3 to 1.2 M_sun. We find that thermal and turbulent
energy support are about equally important in these cores, while rotational
support is negligible. The measured velocity gradients across the cores range
from 6 to 24 km/s/pc. Assuming these gradients are produced by bulk rotation,
we find that the specific angular momenta of the observed Class 0 protostellar
cores are intermediate between those of dense (prestellar) molecular cloud
cores and the orbital angular momenta of wide PMS binary systems. There appears
to be no evolution (decrease) of angular momentum from the smallest prestellar
cores via protostellar cores to wide PMS binary systems. In the context that
most protostellar cores are assumed to fragment and form binary stars, this
means that most of the angular momentum contained in the collapse region is
transformed into orbital angular momentum of the resulting stellar binary
systems.
"
What are the advantages of introducing the subject in a compact way?,"  Elementary particle physics is the quadrant of nature whose laws can be
written in a few lines with absolute precision and the greatest empirical
adequacy. If this is the case, as I believe it is, it must be possible and is
probably useful to introduce the students and the interested readers to the
entire subject in a compact way. This is the main aim of these Lectures.
"
What is the mass-to-light ratio of the Leo II dwarf spheroidal galaxy based on the authors' analysis?,"  Using SDSS I data, we have analysed the stellar distribution of the Leo II
dwarf spheroidal galaxy (distance of 233 kpc) to search for evidence of tidal
deformation. The existing SDSS photometric catalogue contains gaps in regions
of high stellar crowding, hence we filled the area at the centre of Leo II
using the DAOPHOT algorithm applied to the SDSS images. The combined
DAOPHOT-SDSS dataset contains three-filter photometry over a 4x4 square degree
region centred on Leo II. By defining a mask in three-filter colour-magnitude
space, we removed the majority of foreground field stars. We have measured the
following Leo II structural parameters: a core radius of r_c = 2.64 +/- 0.19
arcmin (178 +/- 13 pc), a tidal radius of r_t = 9.33 +/- 0.47 arcmin (632 +/-
32 pc) and a total V-band luminosity of L_V = (7.4 +/- 2.0) times 10^5 L_sun
(M_V = -9.9 +/- 0.3). Our comprehensive analysis of the Leo II structure did
not reveal any significant signs of tidal distortion. The internal structure of
this object contains only mild isophotal twisting. A small overdensity was
discovered appoximately 4.5 tidal radii from the Leo II centre, however we
conclude it is unlikely to be material tidally stripped from Leo II based on
its stellar population, and is most likely a foreground overdensity of stars.
Our results indicate that the influence of the Galactic graviational field on
the structure of Leo II has been relatively mild. We rederived the
mass-to-light ratio of this system using existing kinematic data combined with
our improved structural measurements, and favour the scenario in which Leo II
is strongly dominated by dark matter with (M/L)_V ~ 100 in solar units.
"
What is the crossover exponent of the DP universality class in one dimension?,"  At non-equilibrium phase transitions into absorbing (trapped) states, it is
well known that the directed percolation (DP) critical scaling is shared by two
classes of models with a single (S) absorbing state and with infinitely many
(IM) absorbing states. We study the crossover behavior in one dimension,
arising from a considerable reduction of the number of absorbing states
(typically from the IM-type to the S-type DP models), by following two
different (excitatory or inhibitory) routes which make the auxiliary field
density abruptly jump at the crossover. Along the excitatory route, the system
becomes overly activated even for an infinitesimal perturbation and its
crossover becomes discontinuous. Along the inhibitory route, we find continuous
crossover with the universal crossover exponent $\phi\simeq 1.78(6)$, which is
argued to be equal to $\nu_\|$, the relaxation time exponent of the DP
universality class on a general footing. This conjecture is also confirmed in
the case of the directed Ising (parity-conserving) class. Finally, we discuss
the effect of diffusion to the IM-type models and suggest an argument why
diffusive models with some hybrid-type reactions should belong to the DP class.
"
What is the Hubble parameter H(z) determined from recent data?,"  We discuss the cosmological degeneracy between the age of the Universe, the
Hubble parameter and the effective number of relativistic particles N_eff. We
show that independent determinations of the Hubble parameter H(z) as those
recently provided by Simon,Verde, Jimenez (2006), combined with other
cosmological data sets can provide the most stringent constraint on N_eff,
yielding N_eff=3.7 (-1.2) (+1.1) at 95% confidence level. A neutrino background
is detected with high significance: N_eff >1.8 at better than 99% confidence
level. Constraints on the age of the universe in the framework of an extra
background of relativistic particles are improved by a factor 3.
"
What are the implications of the congruence between coefficients of P0 and Pk for k of large 3-adic valuation?,"  Let $p$ be prime, $N$ be a positive integer prime to $p$, and $k$ be an
integer. Let $P_k(t)$ be the characteristic series for Atkin's $U$ operator as
an endomorphism of $p$-adic overconvergent modular forms of tame level $N$ and
weight $k$. Motivated by conjectures of Gouvea and Mazur, we strengthen Wan's
congruence between coefficients of $P_k$ and $P_{k'}$ for $k'$ close
$p$-adically to $k$. For $p-1 | 12$, $N = 1$, $k = 0$, we compute a matrix for
$U$ whose entries are coefficients in the power series of a rational function
of two variables. We apply this computation to show for $p = 3$ a parabola
below the Newton polygon $N_0$ of $P_0$, which coincides with $N_0$ infinitely
often. As a consequence, we find a polygonal curve above $N_0$. This tightest
bound on $N_0$ yields the strongest congruences between coefficients of $P_0$
and $P_k$ for $k$ of large 3-adic valuation.
"
What are the three types of coordinates in the canonical form of the metric?,"  We expand previous work on an inverse approach to Einstein Field Equations
where we include fluids with energy flux and consider the vanishing of the
anisotropic stress tensor. We consider the approach using warped product
spacetimes of class $B_1$. Although restricted, these spacetimes include many
exact solutions of interest to compact object studies and to cosmological
models studies. The question explored here is as follows: given a spacetime
metric, what fluid flow (timelike congruence), if any, could generate the
spacetime via Einstein's equations. We calculate the flow from the condition of
a vanishing anisotropic stress tensor and give results in terms of the metric
functions in the three canonical types of coordinates. A condition for perfect
fluid sources is also provided. The framework developed is algorithmic and
suited for the study and validation of exact solutions using computer algebra
systems. The framework can be applied to solutions in comoving and non-comoving
frames of reference, and examples in different types of coordinates are worked
out.
"
What are the criteria for separability of two qubits in the Werner states?,"  We present a description of finite dimensional quantum entanglement, based on
a study of the space of all convex decompositions of a given density matrix. On
this space we construct a system of real polynomial equations describing
separable states. We further study this system using statistical mechanical
methods. Finally, we apply our techniques to Werner states of two qubits and
obtain a sufficient criterion for separability.
"
What is the physics of the cobalt octahedral complex at x~1?,"  We propose a minimal model resolving a puzzle of enigmatic correlations
observed in sodium-rich Na$_x$CoO$_2$ where one expects a simple, free motion
of the dilute $S=1/2$ holes doped into a band insulator NaCoO$_2$. The model
also predicts singlet superconductivity at experimentally observed
compositions. The model is based on a key property of cobalt oxides -- the
spin-state quasidegeneracy of CoO$_6$ octahedral complex -- leading to an
unusual physics of, {\it e.g.}, LaCoO$_3$. We show that correlated hopping
between $t_{2g}$ and $e_g$ states leads to the spin-polaron physics at $x\sim
1$, and to an extended s-wave pairing at larger doping when coherent fermionic
bands are formed.
"
What is the physical interpretation of a mean field theory for the LLL vortex nucleation?,"  With the imminent advent of mesoscopic rotating BECs in the lowest Landau
level (LLL) regime, we explore LLL vortex nucleation. An exact many-body
analysis is presented in a weakly elliptical trap for up to 400 particles.
Striking non-mean field features are exposed at filling factors >>1 . Eg near
the critical rotation frequency pairs of energy levels approach each other with
exponential accuracy. A physical interpretation is provided by requantising a
mean field theory, where 1/N plays the role of Planck's constant, revealing two
vortices cooperatively tunneling between classically degenerate energy minima.
The tunnel splitting variation is described in terms of frequency, particle
number and ellipticity.
"
What is the level-rank duality of untwisted and epsilon-twisted D-branes in the so(N)_K WZW model?,"  We analyze the level-rank duality of untwisted and epsilon-twisted D-branes
of the so(N)_K WZW model. Untwisted D-branes of so(N)_K are characterized by
integrable tensor and spinor representations of so(N)_K. Level-rank duality
maps untwisted so(N)_K D-branes corresponding to (equivalence classes of)
tensor representations onto those of so(K)_N. The epsilon-twisted D-branes of
so(2n)_2k are characterized by (a subset of) integrable tensor and spinor
representations of so(2n-1)_2k+1. Level-rank duality maps spinor
epsilon-twisted so(2n)_2k D-branes onto those of so(2k)_2n. For both untwisted
and epsilon-twisted D-branes, we prove that the spectrum of an open string
ending on these D-branes is isomorphic to the spectrum of an open string ending
on the level-rank-dual D-branes.
"
What is the criterion for determining whether a material exhibits shear bands?,"  We model a sheared disordered solid using the theory of Shear Transformation
Zones (STZs). In this mean-field continuum model the density of zones is
governed by an effective temperature that approaches a steady state value as
energy is dissipated. We compare the STZ model to simulations by Shi, et
al.(Phys. Rev. Lett. 98 185505 2007), finding that the model generates
solutions that fit the data,exhibit strain localization, and capture important
features of the localization process. We show that perturbations to the
effective temperature grow due to an instability in the transient dynamics, but
unstable systems do not always develop shear bands. Nonlinear energy
dissipation processes interact with perturbation growth to determine whether a
material exhibits strain localization. By estimating the effects of these
interactions, we derive a criterion that determines which materials exhibit
shear bands based on the initial conditions alone. We also show that the shear
band width is not set by an inherent diffusion length scale but instead by a
dynamical scale that depends on the imposed strain rate.
"
What are the applications of thermal-state qubits and thermal-Bell states to thermal mixtures?,"  We study characteristics of superpositions and entanglement of thermal states
at high temperatures and discuss their applications to quantum information
processing. We introduce thermal-state qubits and thermal-Bell states, which
are a generalization of pure-state qubits and Bell states to thermal mixtures.
A scheme is then presented to discriminate between the four thermal-Bell states
without photon number resolving detection but with Kerr nonlinear interactions
and two single-photon detectors. This enables one to perform quantum
teleportation and gate operations for quantum computation with thermal-state
qubits.
"
What are the two crucial effects incorporated in the general continuum theory of ion intercalation dynamics in a single crystal of a rechargeable battery cathode?,"  A general continuum theory is developed for ion intercalation dynamics in a
single crystal of a rechargeable battery cathode. It is based on an existing
phase-field formulation of the bulk free energy and incorporates two crucial
effects: (i) anisotropic ionic mobility in the crystal and (ii) surface
reactions governing the flux of ions across the electrode/electrolyte
interface, depending on the local free energy difference. Although the phase
boundary can form a classical diffusive ""shrinking core"" when the dynamics is
bulk-transport-limited, the theory also predicts a new regime of
surface-reaction-limited (SRL) dynamics, where the phase boundary extends from
surface to surface along planes of fast ionic diffusion, consistent with recent
experiments on LiFePO4. In the SRL regime, the theory produces a fundamentally
new equation for phase transformation dynamics, which admits traveling-wave
solutions. Rather than forming a shrinking core of untransformed material, the
phase boundary advances by filling (or emptying) successive channels of fast
diffusion in the crystal. By considering the random nucleation of SRL
phase-transformation waves, the theory predicts a very different picture of
charge/discharge dynamics from the classical diffusion-limited model, which
could affect the interpretation of experimental data for LiFePO4.
"
"What are the requirements for the calibration laser pulses in the reconstruction method, and how do they facilitate the calibration process?","  We propose a method to reconstruct the vibrational quantum state of molecules
excited by a general excitation laser pulse. Unlike existing methods, we do not
require the molecules before excitation to be in a pure state, allowing us to
treat the important case of initially thermally excited molecules. Even if only
a single initial level is appreciably populated, initial levels with small
populations can still give major contributions to the unknown vibrational
state, making it essential to take them into account. In addition to the
excitation pulse, the method uses two incident, short laser pulses in a
non-co-linear geometry to create four-wave mixing in the molecules. The
measurements used in the reconstruction are spectra of the outgoing four-wave
mixing pulse at different time delays of the excitation laser pulse. An
important point is that the method does not require detailed knowledge of
molecular transition moments between excited states nor of any of the incoming
laser pulses, but circumvents this requirement by using one or more calibration
laser pulses in a separate experiment either before or after the main data are
recorded. The only requirements for the calibration laser pulses are that the
constant parts of their spectrums should together cover the spectral range of
the excitation laser pulse, and the constant part of each should have
sufficient spectral overlap with one other calibration pulse to populate two of
the same levels. Finally, we discuss the extension of the reconstruction method
in this paper to more general situations, hereby presenting the new idea of
quantum state reconstruction through perturbations with calibration.
"
What is the role of the shape of the velocity profile in the flow electrification of polymer melts?,"  Flow electrification of polymer melts is an important side effect of polymer
processing. The studies dealing with this phenomenon are seldom and most of the
scientific work has been focused on flow electrification of aqueous and
insulating Newtonian liquids. From that prior art it is well established that
the flow electrification in Newtonian liquids is a consequence of the formation
of an ionic double layer. Convection of this layer induces the electrification
of the liquid at the outlet of the pipe. In those models, the key parameters
governing the flow electrification are thus the intrinsic electrical properties
of the polymer and the flow characteristics. In this work, we reconsider the
assumptions made previously and we propose a new approach to modelise the flow
electrification in the particular case of non-Newtonian polymer materials in
laminar flow conditions. We establish that, a key parameter for the
electrification quantification in the polymer melt is the shape of the velocity
profile. Additionally, in some cases, we show that a slip velocity at the
polymer/die wall interface must be considered to describe accurately the
electrification. As a consequence, we deduce that the slip velocity at the
interface can be calculated by measuring the electrification: this work gives
an alternative manner to measure the slip velocity during polymer flow.
"
What is the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa quark-mixing matrix used to determine the strange quark mass and the element |V_us| of the quark?,"  We report on measurements of branching fractions for several hadronic tau
decays to final states with kaons, which can be used to determine the strange
quark mass and the element |V_us| of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa quark-mixing
matrix. The results are obtained from data collected with the BaBar and Belle
detectors at the PEP-II and KEKB asymmetric-energy e+e- colliders at SLAC and
KEK, respectively, both operating at center-of-mass energies near the Y(4S)
resonance.
"
What is the structure of the one-particle sector of the theory?,"  We study the quantization of a linear scalar field, whose symmetries are
described by the kappa-Poincare' Hopf-algebra, via deformed Fock space
construction. The one-particle sector of the theory exhibits a natural
(planckian) cut-off for the field modes. At the multi-particle level the
non-trivial co-algebra structure of kappa-Poincare' leads to a deformed
bosonization in the construction of Fock space states. These physical states
carry energy-momentum charges which are divergenceless and obey a deformed
dispersion relation.
"
What is the statistical correlation between the properties of haloes and their environment?,"  N-body simulations have demonstrated a correlation between the properties of
haloes and their environment. In this paper, we assess whether the ellipsoidal
collapse model can produce a similar dependence. First, we explore the
statistical correlation that originates from Gaussian initial conditions. We
derive analytic expressions for a number of joint statistics of the shear
tensor and estimate the sensitivity of the local characteristics of the shear
to the global geometry of the large scale environment. Next, we concentrate on
the dynamical aspect of the environmental dependence using a simplified model
that takes into account the interaction between a collapsing halo and its
environment. We find that the tidal force exerted by the surrounding mass
distribution causes haloes embedded in overdense regions to virialize earlier.
An effective density threshold whose shape depends on the large scale density
provides a good description of this environmental effect. We show that, using
this approach, a correlation between formation redshift, large scale bias and
environment density naturally arises. The strength of the effect is comparable,
albeit smaller, to that seen in simulations. It is largest for low mass haloes
and decreases as one goes to higher mass objects. Furthermore, haloes that
formed early are substantially more clustered than those that assembled
recently. On the other hand, our analytic model predicts a decrease in median
formation redshift with increasing environment density, in disagreement with
the trend detected in overdense regions. However, our results appear consistent
with the behaviour inferred in relatively underdense regions. We argue that the
ellipsoidal collapse model may apply in low density environments where
nonlinear effects are negligible (abridged).
"
What is the generalization of Darcy's Law used to derive the gradient-flow dynamics of an arbitrary geometric quantity?,"  The gradient-flow dynamics of an arbitrary geometric quantity is derived
using a generalization of Darcy's Law. We consider flows in both Lagrangian and
Eulerian formulations. The Lagrangian formulation includes a dissipative
modification of fluid mechanics. Eulerian equations for self-organization of
scalars, 1-forms and 2-forms are shown to reduce to nonlocal characteristic
equations. We identify singular solutions of these equations corresponding to
collapsed (clumped) states and discuss their evolution.
"
What is the classical inequality used to prove the divergence of the harmonic series?,"  The divergence of the harmonic series is proved by direct comparison with a
series whose nth partial sum telescopes to the natural logarithm of n. The key
idea is to apply the classical inequality x>=log(1+x) (valid for x>-1) with
x=1/k and sum over k, 1<=k<=n-1.
"
What are the implications of the knot invariant on the weight system in knot theory?,"  We prove that if a finite order knot invariant does not distinguish mutant
knots, then the corresponding weight system depends on the intersection graph
of a chord diagram rather than on the diagram itself. The converse statement is
easy and well known. We discuss relationship between our results and certain
Lie algebra weight systems.
"
What is the rate of convergence of discrete-time approximations for solutions of pathwise SDEs driven by fBm with Hurst index $H>1/2$?,"  The paper focuses on discrete-type approximations of solutions to
non-homogeneous stochastic differential equations (SDEs) involving fractional
Brownian motion (fBm). We prove that the rate of convergence for Euler
approximations of solutions of pathwise SDEs driven by fBm with Hurst index
$H>1/2$ can be estimated by $O(\delta^{2H-1})$ ($\delta$ is the diameter of
partition). For discrete-time approximations of Skorohod-type quasilinear
equation driven by fBm we prove that the rate of convergence is $O(\delta^H)$.
"
What is the Dirac-Brueckner-Hartree-Fock approach used to study the thermodynamics of quark matter?,"  We study the thermodynamics of two flavor color superconducting (2SC) quark
matter within a nonlocal chiral quark model, using both instantaneous and
covariant nonlocal interactions. For applications to compact stars, we impose
conditions of electric and color charge neutrality as well as beta equilibrium
and construct a phase transition to the hadronic matter phase described within
the Dirac-Brueckner-Hartree-Fock (DBHF) approach. We obtain mass-radius
relations for hybrid star configurations which fulfill modern observational
constraints, including compact star masses above 2 M_sun.
"
What is the relationship between the age and metallicity of star clusters in the galaxy M33?,"  We present a new catalog of star cluster candidates in the nearby spiral
galaxy M33. It is based on eight existing catalogs wherein we have
cross-referenced identifications and endeavored to resolve inconsistencies
between them. Our catalog contains 451 candidates of which 255 are confirmed
clusters based on HST and high resolution ground-based imaging. The catalog
contains precise cluster positions (RA and Dec), magnitudes and colors in the
UBVRIJHKs filters, metallicities, radial velocities, masses and ages, where
available, and galactocentric distances for each cluster. The color
distribution of the M33 clusters appears to be similar to those in the Large
Magellanic Cloud with major peaks at (B-V)o~0.15, and (B-V)o~0.65. The
intrinsic colors are correlated with cluster ages, which range from 10^{7.5} to
10^{10.3} years. The age distribution of the star clusters supports the notion
of rapid cluster disruption with a slope of alpha=-1.09 +/- 0.07 in the
dN_{cluster}/dt ~ t^{alpha} relation. In addition, comparison to theoretical
single stellar population models suggests the presence of an age-metallicity
relation among these clusters with younger clusters being more metal-rich.
Analysis of the radial distribution of the clusters yields some evidence that
younger clusters (age <~ 1 Gyr) may be more concentrated toward the center of
M33 than older ones. A similar comparison with the radial profile of the M33
field stars shows the clusters to be more centrally concentrated at the greater
than 99.9% confidence level. Possible reasons for this are presented and
discussed; however, the overwhelming conclusion seems to be that a more
complete and thorough cluster search is needed covering at least 4 square
degrees centered on M33.
"
What is the theoretical approach to calculate dynamic properties of molecular motors?,"  Dynamic properties of molecular motors that fuel their motion by actively
interacting with underlying molecular tracks are studied theoretically via
discrete-state stochastic ``burnt-bridge'' models. The transport of the
particles is viewed as an effective diffusion along one-dimensional lattices
with periodically distributed weak links. When an unbiased random walker passes
the weak link it can be destroyed (``burned'') with probability p, providing a
bias in the motion of the molecular motor. A new theoretical approach that
allows one to calculate exactly all dynamic properties of motor proteins, such
as velocity and dispersion, at general conditions is presented. It is found
that dispersion is a decreasing function of the concentration of bridges, while
the dependence of dispersion on the burning probability is more complex. Our
calculations also show a gap in dispersion for very low concentrations of weak
links which indicates a dynamic phase transition between unbiased and biased
diffusion regimes. Theoretical findings are supported by Monte Carlo computer
simulations.
"
What is the impact of the Higgs sector on the standard model?,"  We examine the effects of new physics effecting the Higgs sector of the
standard model, focusing on the effects on the Higgs self couplings. We
demonstrate that a low mass higgs, m_h < 2 m_t, can have a strong effective
self coupling due to the effects of a new interaction at a TeV. We investigate
the possibility that the first evidence of such an interaction could be a
higgs-higgs bound state. To this end, we construct an effective field theory
formalism to examine the physics of such a low mass higgs boson. We explore the
possibility of a non relativistic bound state of the higgs field (Higgsium) at
LHC and construct a non relativistic effective field theory of the higgs sector
that is appropriate for such studies (NRHET).
"
What are the advantages of the new real-space cut-off correction term in the P3M algorithm?,"  We optimize Hockney and Eastwood's Particle-Particle Particle-Mesh (P3M)
algorithm to achieve maximal accuracy in the electrostatic energies (instead of
forces) in 3D periodic charged systems. To this end we construct an optimal
influence function that minimizes the RMS errors in the energies. As a
by-product we derive a new real-space cut-off correction term, give a
transparent derivation of the systematic errors in terms of Madelung energies,
and provide an accurate analytical estimate for the RMS error of the energies.
This error estimate is a useful indicator of the accuracy of the computed
energies, and allows an easy and precise determination of the optimal values of
the various parameters in the algorithm (Ewald splitting parameter, mesh size
and charge assignment order).
"
What is the relationship between the molecular gas distribution and the strong starburst in the galaxy NGC 4569?,"  This work is part of the NUGA survey of CO emission in nearby active
galaxies. We present observations of NGC4569, a member of the Virgo Cluster. We
analyse the molecular gas distribution and kinematics in the central region and
we investigate a possible link to the strong starburst present at the nucleus.
70% of the 1.1x10^9 Msolar of molecular gas detected in the inner 20"" is found
to be concentrated within the inner 800 pc and is distributed along the large
scale stellar bar seen in near-infrared observations. A hole in the CO
distribution coincides with the nucleus where most of the Halpha emission and
blue light are emitted. The kinematics are modelled in three different ways,
ranging from the purely geometrical to the most physical. This approach allows
us to constrain progressively the physical properties of the galaxy and
eventually to emerge with a reasonable fit to an analytical model of orbits in
a barred potential. Fitting an axisymmetric model shows that the non-circular
motions must be comparable in amplitude to the circular motions (120 km/s).
Fitting a model based on elliptical orbits allows us to identify with
confidence the single inner Lindblad resonance (ILR) of the large scale bar.
Finally, a model based on analytical solutions for the gas particle orbits in a
weakly barred potential constrained by the ILR radius reproduces the
observations well. The mass inflow rate is then estimated and discussed based
on the best fit model solution. The gravitational torques implied by this model
are able to efficiently funnel the gas inside the ILR down to 300 pc, although
another mechanism must take over to fuel the nuclear starburst inside 100 pc.

What are the absolute magnitudes and spectral types of the components of the triple star system GJ 900?,"  Speckle interferometric observations made with the 6 m telescope of the
Special Astrophysical Observatory of the Russian Academy of Sciences in 2000
revealed the triple nature of the nearby ($\pi_{Hip}=51.80\pm1.74$ mas)
low-mass young ($\approx200$ Myr) star GJ 900. The configuration of the triple
system allowed it to be dynamically unstable. Differential photometry performed
from 2000 through 2004 yielded $I$- and $K$-band absolute magnitudes and
spectral types for the components to be $I_{A}$=6.66$\pm$0.08,
$I_{B}$=9.15$\pm$0.11, $I_{C}$=10.08$\pm$0.26, $K_{A}$=4.84$\pm$0.08,
$K_{B}$=6.76$\pm$0.20, $K_{C}$=7.39$\pm$0.31, $Sp_{A}$$\approx$K5--K7,
$Sp_{B}$$\approx$M3--M4, $Sp_{C}$$\approx$M5--M6. The ``mass--luminosity''
relation is used to estimate the individual masses of the components:
$\mathcal{M}_{A}$$\approx0.64\mathcal{M}_{\odot}$,
$\mathcal{M}_{B}$$\approx0.21\mathcal{M}_{\odot}$,
$\mathcal{M}_{C}$$\approx0.13\mathcal{M}_{\odot}$. From the observations of the
components relative motion in the period 2000--2006, we conclude that GJ 900 is
a hierarchical triple star with the possible orbital periods
P$_{A-BC}$$\approx$80 yrs and P$_{BC}$$\approx$20 yrs. An analysis of the 2MASS
images of the region around GJ 900 leads us to suggest that the system can
include other very-low-mass components.
"
What is the relationship between the transmitter and receiver in the model of sparse communication?,"  We consider asynchronous communication over point-to-point discrete
memoryless channels. The transmitter starts sending one block codeword at an
instant that is uniformly distributed within a certain time period, which
represents the level of asynchronism. The receiver, by means of a sequential
decoder, must isolate the message without knowing when the codeword
transmission starts but being cognizant of the asynchronism level A. We are
interested in how quickly can the receiver isolate the sent message,
particularly in the regime where A is exponentially larger than the codeword
length N, which we refer to as `strong asynchronism.'
  This model of sparse communication may represent the situation of a sensor
that remains idle most of the time and, only occasionally, transmits
information to a remote base station which needs to quickly take action.
  The first result shows that vanishing error probability can be guaranteed as
N tends to infinity while A grows as Exp(N*k) if and only if k does not exceed
the `synchronization threshold,' a constant that admits a simple closed form
expression, and is at least as large as the capacity of the synchronized
channel. The second result is the characterization of a set of achievable
strictly positive rates in the regime where A is exponential in N, and where
the rate is defined with respect to the expected delay between the time
information starts being emitted until the time the receiver makes a decision.
  As an application of the first result we consider antipodal signaling over a
Gaussian channel and derive a simple necessary condition between A, N, and SNR
for achieving reliable communication.
"
What are the formulas of the fidelity and the fidelity susceptibility for the one-dimensional Tomonaga-Luttinger model?,"  A general relation between quantum phase transitions and the second
derivative of the fidelity (or the ""fidelity susceptibility"") is proposed. The
validity and the limitation of the fidelity susceptibility in characterizing
quantum phase transitions is thus established. Moreover, based on the
bosonization method, general formulas of the fidelity and the fidelity
susceptibility are obtained for a class of one-dimensional gapless systems
known as the Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid. Applying these formulas to the
one-dimensional spin-1/2 $XXZ$ model, we find that quantum phase transitions,
even of the Beresinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless type, can be signaled by the
fidelity susceptibility.
"
What is the perturbative QCD in the model based on Lagrangian form factors?,"  We adopt the vector-meson-dominance approach to investigate Q^2-evolution of
N-R transition form factors (N denotes nucleon and R an excited resonance) in
the first and second resonance regions. The developed model is based upon
conventional NR\gamma-interaction Lagrangians, introducing three form factors
for spin-3/2 resonances and two form factors for spin-1/2 nucleon excitations.
Lagrangian form factors are expressed as dispersionlike expansions with four or
five poles corresponding to the lowest excitations of the mesons \rho(770) and
\omega(782). Correct high-Q^2 form factor behavior predicted by perturbative
QCD is due to phenomenological logarithmic renormalization of electromagnetic
coupling constants and linear superconvergence relations between the parameters
of the meson spectrum. The model is found to be in good agreement with all the
experimental data on Q^2-dependence of the transitions N-\Delta(1232),
N-N(1440), N-N(1520), N-N(1535). We present fit results and model predictions
for high-energy experiments proposed by JLab. Besides, we make special emphasis
on the transition to perturbative domain of N-\Delta(1232) form factors.
"
What is the notion of utility in Grid computing?,"  We outline design and lines of development of autonomous tools for the
computing Grid management, monitoring and optimization. The management is
proposed to be based on the notion of utility. Grid optimization is considered
to be application-oriented. A generic Grid simulator is proposed as an
optimization tool for Grid structure and functionality.
"
What is the role of Lagrange multipliers in the calculation of the additive forcing function?,"  We study resonances of multidimensional chaotic map dynamics. We use the
calculus of variations to determine the additive forcing function that induces
the largest response, that is, the greatest deviation from the unperturbed
dynamics. We include the additional constraint that only select degrees of
freedom be forced, corresponding to a very general class of problems in which
not all of the degrees of freedom in an experimental system are accessible to
forcing. We find that certain Lagrange multipliers take on a fundamental
physical role as the efficiency of the forcing function and the effective
forcing experienced by the degrees of freedom which are not forced directly.
Furthermore, we find that the product of the displacement of nearby
trajectories and the effective total forcing function is a conserved quantity.
We demonstrate the efficacy of this methodology with several examples.
"
What is the MBE structure used to achieve ultra-short laser pulses using passive mode-locking?,"  Solid state lasers are demanding independent control in the gain media and
cavity loss to achieve ultra short laser pulses using passive mode-locking.
Recently, laser mode-locking is achieved with a MBE structure with multiple
quantum wells, designed to achieve two functions; Bragg mirror and changes in
absorption to control the cavity dynamics. The use of an AlGaAs/AlAs Bragg
mirror with a 15 nm GaAs saturable absorber used in a Cr:LiSAF tuneable laser
proved to be effective to produce femtosecond pulses. The use of saturable
absorbers thus far is a trial and error procedure that is changing due to the
correlation with more predictive procedures.
"
What are the results on matrix canonical forms for quantum error correction?,"  Results on matrix canonical forms are used to give a complete description of
the higher rank numerical range of matrices arising from the study of quantum
error correction. It is shown that the set can be obtained as the intersection
of closed half planes (of complex numbers). As a result, it is always a convex
set in $\mathcal C$. Moreover, the higher rank numerical range of a normal
matrix is a convex polygon determined by the eigenvalues. These two
consequences confirm the conjectures of Choi et al. on the subject. In
addition, the results are used to derive a formula for the optimal upper bound
for the dimension of a totally isotropic subspace of a square matrix, and
verify the solvability of certain matrix equations.
"
What is the asymptotic form of the Renyi entropy for a block of spins at zero temperature?,"  We consider the one-dimensional XY quantum spin chain in a transverse
magnetic field. We are interested in the Renyi entropy of a block of L
neighboring spins at zero temperature on an infinite lattice. The Renyi entropy
is essentially the trace of some power $\alpha$ of the density matrix of the
block. We calculate the asymptotic for $L \to \infty$ analytically in terms of
Klein's elliptic $\lambda$ - function. We study the limiting entropy as a
function of its parameter $\alpha$. We show that up to the trivial addition
terms and multiplicative factors, and after a proper re-scaling, the Renyi
entropy is an automorphic function with respect to a certain subgroup of the
modular group; moreover, the subgroup depends on whether the magnetic field is
above or below its critical value. Using this fact, we derive the
transformation properties of the Renyi entropy under the map $\alpha \to
\alpha^{-1}$ and show that the entropy becomes an elementary function of the
magnetic field and the anisotropy when $\alpha$ is a integer power of 2, this
includes the purity $tr \rho^2$. We also analyze the behavior of the entropy as
$\alpha \to 0$ and $\infty$ and at the critical magnetic field and in the
isotropic limit [XX model].
"
What are the implications of the measurability of the coefficients $a^{11}$ and VMO for the solvability of parabolic equations in Sobolev spaces with mixed norms?,"  The unique solvability of parabolic equations in Sobolev spaces with mixed
norms is presented. The second order coefficients (except $a^{11}$) are assumed
to be only measurable in time and one spatial variable, and VMO in the other
spatial variables. The coefficient $a^{11}$ is measurable in one spatial
variable and VMO in the other variables.
"
What are the implications of the entropy-weighted sum in the Feynman's path integral for the cosmological scenario?,"  We discuss how, in a Universe restricted to the causal region connected to
the observer, General Relativity implies the quantum nature of physical
phenomena and directly leads to a string theory scenario, whose dynamics is
ruled by a functional that weights all configurations according to their
entropy. The most favoured configurations are those of minimal entropy. Along
this class of vacua a four-dimensional space-time is automatically selected;
when, at large volume, a description of space-time in terms of classical
geometry can be recovered, the entropy-weighted sum reduces to the ordinary
Feynman's path integral. What arises is a highly predictive scenario,
phenomenologically compatible with the experimental observations and
measurements, in which everything is determined in terms of the fundamental
constants and the age of the Universe, with no room for freely-adjustable
parameters. We discuss how this leads to the known spectrum of particles and
interactions. Besides the computation of masses and couplings, CKM matrix
elements, cosmological constant, expansion parameters of the Universe etc...,
all resulting, within the degree of the approximation we used, in agreement
with the experimental observations, we also discuss how this scenario passes
the tests provided by cosmology and the constraints imposed by the physics of
the primordial Universe.
"
What are the implications of the data for the stars in the Hubble Space Telescope?,"  Photoelectric data on the Johnson-Kron-Cousins UBVRI broadband photometric
system are provided for a set of stars which have been used as
spectrophotometric standard stars at the Hubble Space Telescope.
"
What is the empirical prescription for low-mass star formation in a contracting cloud?,"  We explore, through a simplified, semi-analytic model, the formation of dense
clusters containing massive stars. The parent cloud spawning the cluster is
represented as an isothermal sphere. This sphere is in near force balance
between self-gravity and turbulent pressure. Self-gravity, mediated by
turbulent dissipation, drives slow contraction of the cloud, eventually leading
to a sharp central spike in density and the onset of dynamical instability. We
suggest that, in a real cloud, this transition marks the late and rapid
production of massive stars.
  We also offer an empirical prescription, akin to the Schmidt law, for
low-mass star formation in our contracting cloud. Applying this prescription to
the Orion Nebula Cluster, we are able to reproduce the accelerating star
formation previously inferred from the distribution of member stars in the HR
diagram. The cloud turns about 10 percent of its mass into low-mass stars
before becoming dynamically unstable. Over a cloud free-fall time, this figure
drops to 1 percent, consistent with the overall star formation efficiency of
molecular clouds in the Galaxy.
"
How is realistic quantum trajectory theory extended to incorporate realistic imperfections in the measurement of solid-state qubits?,"  The extension of quantum trajectory theory to incorporate realistic
imperfections in the measurement of solid-state qubits is important for quantum
computation, particularly for the purposes of state preparation and
error-correction as well as for readout of computations. Previously this has
been achieved for low-frequency (dc) weak measurements. In this paper we extend
realistic quantum trajectory theory to include radio frequency (rf) weak
measurements where a low-transparency quantum point contact (QPC), coupled to a
charge qubit, is used to damp a classical oscillator circuit. The resulting
realistic quantum trajectory equation must be solved numerically. We present an
analytical result for the limit of large dissipation within the oscillator
(relative to the QPC), where the oscillator slaves to the qubit. The rf+dc mode
of operation is considered. Here the QPC is biased (dc) as well as subjected to
a small-amplitude sinusoidal carrier signal (rf). The rf+dc QPC is shown to be
a low-efficiency charge-qubit detector, that may nevertheless be higher than
the dc-QPC (which is subject to 1/f noise).
"
What are the girths of d-regular Cayley graphs of the symmetric group and simple algebraic groups over F_q?,"  We prove that random d-regular Cayley graphs of the symmetric group
asymptotically almost surely have girth at least (log_{d-1}|G|)^{1/2}/2 and
that random d-regular Cayley graphs of simple algebraic groups over F_q
asymptotically almost surely have girth at least log_{d-1}|G|/dim(G). For the
symmetric p-groups the girth is between log log |G| and (log|G|)^alpha with
alpha<1. Several conjectures and open questions are presented.
"
What are the conceptual issues that arise in the study of quantum field theory in an external background?,"  The quantum theory of a harmonic oscillator with a time dependent frequency
arises in several important physical problems, especially in the study of
quantum field theory in an external background. While the mathematics of this
system is straightforward, several conceptual issues arise in such a study. We
present a general formalism to address some of the conceptual issues like the
emergence of classicality, definition of particle content, back reaction etc.
In particular, we parametrize the wave function in terms of a complex number
(which we call excitation parameter) and express all physically relevant
quantities in terms it. Many of the notions -- like those of particle number
density, effective Lagrangian etc., which are usually defined using asymptotic
in-out states -- are generalized as time-dependent concepts and we show that
these generalized definitions lead to useful and reasonable results. Having
developed the general formalism we apply it to several examples. Exact analytic
expressions are found for a particular toy model and approximate analytic
solutions are obtained in the extreme cases of adiabatic and highly
non-adiabatic evolution. We then work out the exact results numerically for a
variety of models and compare them with the analytic results and
approximations. The formalism is useful in addressing the question of emergence
of classicality of the quantum state, its relation to particle production and
to clarify several conceptual issues related to this. In Paper II
(arXiv:0708.1237), which is a sequel to this, the formalism will be applied to
analyze the corresponding issues in the context of quantum field theory in
background cosmological models and electric fields.
"
What are the main methods used to compute radiative transition rates and electron impact excitation rate coefficients for the calcium ion?,"  This work reports radiative transition rates and electron impact excitation
rate coefficients for levels of the n= 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 configurations of Ca
II. The radiative data were computed using the Thomas-Fermi-Dirac central
potential method in the frozen core approximation and includes the polarization
interaction between the valence electron and the core using a model potential.
This method allows for configuration interactions (CI) and relativistic effects
in the Breit-Pauli formalism. Collision strengths in LS-coupling were
calculated in the close coupling approximation with the R-matrix method. Then,
fine structure collision strengths were obtained by means of the
intermediate-coupling frame transformation (ICFT) method which accounts for
spin-orbit coupling effects. We present extensive comparisons with the most
recent calculations and measurements for Ca II as well as a comparison between
the core polarization results and the ""unpolarized"" values. We find that core
polarization affects the computed lifetimes by up to 20%. Our results are in
very close agreement with recent measurements for the lifetimes of metastable
levels. The present collision strengths were integrated over a Maxwellian
distribution of electron energies and the resulting effective collision
strengths are given for a wide range of temperatures. Our effective collision
strengths for the resonance transitions are within ~11% from previous values
derived from experimental measurements, but disagree with latter computations
using the distorted wave approximation.
"
What are the explicit formulas for metric connections in the bundle of Dirac spinors?,"  Two explicit formulas for metric connections in the bundle of Dirac spinors
are studied. Their equivalence is proved. The explicit formula relating the
spinor curvature tensor with the Riemann curvature tensor is rederived.
"
What is the interaction between itinerant and Mott localized electronic states in strongly correlated materials?,"  The interaction between itinerant and Mott localized electronic states in
strongly correlated materials is studied within dynamical mean field theory in
combination with the numerical renormalization group method. A novel
nonmagnetic zero temperature quantum phase transition is found in the
bad-metallic orbital-selective Mott phase of the two-band Hubbard model, for
values of the Hund's exchange which are relevant to typical transition metal
oxides.
"
What are the results of the computations of the Kaehler rank and the Kato surface?,"  Harvey and Lawson introduced the Kaehler rank and computed it in connection
to the cone of positive exact currents of bidimension (1,1) for many classes of
compact complex surfaces. In this paper we extend these computations to the
only further known class of surfaces not considered by them, that of Kato
surfaces. Our main tool is the reduction to the dynamics of associated
holomorphic contractions.
"
What are the factors that regulate the synchrotron efficiency of extragalactic radio sources?,"  X-ray observations of cavities and shock fronts produced by jets streaming
through hot halos have significantly advanced our understanding of the
energetics and dynamics of extragalactic radio sources. Radio sources at the
centers of clusters have dynamical ages between ten and several hundred million
years. They liberate between 1E58-1E62 erg per outburst, which is enough energy
to regulate cooling of hot halos from galaxies to the richest clusters. Jet
power scales approximately with the radio synchrotron luminosity to the one
half power. However, the synchrotron efficiency varies widely from nearly unity
to one part in 10,000, such that relatively feeble radio source can have
quasar-like mechanical power. The synchrotron ages of cluster radio sources are
decoupled from their dynamical ages, which tend to be factors of several to
orders of magnitude older. Magnetic fields and particles in the lobes tend to
be out of equipartition. The lobes may be maintained by heavy particles (e.g.,
protons), low energy electrons, a hot, diffuse thermal gas, or possibly
magnetic (Poynting) stresses. Sensitive X-ray images of shock fronts and
cavities can be used to study the dynamics of extragalactic radio sources.
"
What is the relationship between precipitation pattern formation and shallow water flow in geothermal systems?,"  A dynamical theory of geophysical precipitation pattern formation is
presented and applied to irreversible calcium carbonate (travertine)
deposition. Specific systems studied here are the terraces and domes observed
at geothermal hot springs, such as those at Yellowstone National Park, and
speleothems, particularly stalactites and stalagmites. The theory couples the
precipitation front dynamics with shallow water flow, including corrections for
turbulent drag and curvature effects. In the absence of capillarity and with a
laminar flow profile, the theory predicts a one-parameter family of steady
state solutions to the moving boundary problem describing the precipitation
front. These shapes match well the measured shapes near the vent at the top of
observed travertine domes. Closer to the base of the dome, the solutions
deviate from observations, and circular symmetry is broken by a fluting
pattern, which we show is associated with capillary forces causing thin film
break-up. We relate our model to that recently proposed for stalactite growth,
and calculate the linear stability spectrum of both travertine domes and
stalactites. Lastly, we apply the theory to the problem of precipitation
pattern formation arising from turbulent flow down an inclined plane, and
identify a linear instability that underlies scale-invariant travertine terrace
formation at geothermal hot springs.
"
What is the relationship between the Banach space X and the convex function f?,"  On each nonreflexive Banach space X there exists a positive continuous convex
function f such that 1/f is not a d.c. function (i.e., a difference of two
continuous convex functions). This result together with known ones implies that
X is reflexive if and only if each everywhere defined quotient of two
continuous convex functions is a d.c. function. Our construction gives also a
stronger version of Klee's result concerning renormings of nonreflexive spaces
and non-norm-attaining functionals.
"
What is the result of the conjecture about the nontriviality of the twisted Chern character?,"  We give details of the proof of the remark made in \cite{G2} that the Chern
characters of the canonical generators on the K homology of the quantum group
$SU_q(2)$ are not invariant under the natural $SU_q(2)$ coaction. Furthermore,
the conjecture made in \cite{G2} about the nontriviality of the twisted Chern
character coming from an odd equivariant spectral triple on $SU_q(2)$ is
settled in the affirmative.
"
What is the relationship between the spin connection resonance and the spin boundary condition in a ferromagnet with finite size?,"  We comment on a recent article of M.W.Evans, Acta Physica Polonica B38 (2007)
2211. We point out that the equations underlying Evans' theory are highly
problematic. Moreover, we demonstrate that the so-called ``spin connection
resonance'', predicted by Evans, cannot be derived from the equation he used.
We provide an exact solution of Evans' corresponding equation and show that is
has definitely no resonance solutions.
"
Can the standard hidden variable assumptions be used to derive Bell inequalities?,"  An experiment is described which proves, using single photons only, that the
standard hidden variables assumptions (commonly used to derive Bell
inequalities) are inconsistent with quantum mechanics. The analysis is very
simple and transparent. In particular, it demonstrates that a classical wave
model for quantum mechanics is not ruled out by experiments demonstrating the
violation of the traditional hidden variable assumptions.
"
What is the relationship between the LP decoder and the maximum likelihood certificate?,"  We develop a framework for linear-programming (LP) decoding of non-binary
linear codes over rings. We prove that the resulting LP decoder has the
`maximum likelihood certificate' property, and we show that the decoder output
is the lowest cost pseudocodeword. Equivalence between pseudocodewords of the
linear program and pseudocodewords of graph covers is proved. LP decoding
performance is illustrated for the (11,6,5) ternary Golay code with ternary PSK
modulation over AWGN, and in this case it is shown that the LP decoder
performance is comparable to codeword-error-rate-optimum hard-decision based
decoding.
"
What is the potential and dynamics of the tachyon field in the FRW universe?,"  In this paper we consider a correspondence between the holographic dark
energy density and tachyon energy density in FRW universe. Then we reconstruct
the potential and the dynamics of the tachyon field which describe tachyon
cosmology.
"
What are the natural relatively minimal subgroups in topological groups?,"  We study relatively minimal subgroups in topological groups. We find, in
particular, some natural relatively minimal subgroups in unipotent groups which
are defined over ""good"" rings. By ""good"" rings we mean archimedean absolute
valued (not necessarily associative) division rings. Some of the classical
rings which we consider besides the field of reals are the ring of quaternions
and the ring of octonions. This way we generalize in part a previous result
which was obtained by Dikranjan and Megrelishvili and involved the Heisenberg
group.
"
"What are the representations of the most degenerate series of the q-deformed algebra U'q(so)(n,C)?","  The q-deformed algebra ${\rm so}'_q(r,s)$ is a real form of the q-deformed
algebra $U'_q({\rm so}(n,\mathbb{C}))$, $n=r+s$, which differs from the quantum
algebra $U_q({\rm so}(n,\mathbb{C}))$ of Drinfeld and Jimbo. We study
representations of the most degenerate series of the algebra ${\rm
so}'_q(r,s)$. The formulas of action of operators of these representations upon
the basis corresponding to restriction of representations onto the subalgebra
${\rm so}'_q(r)\times {\rm so}'_q(s)$ are given. Most of these representations
are irreducible. Reducible representations appear under some conditions for the
parameters determining the representations. All irreducible constituents which
appear in reducible representations of the degenerate series are found. All
$*$-representations of ${\rm so}'_q(r,s)$ are separated in the set of
irreducible representations obtained in the paper.
"
What is the effect of a Josephson junction on the critical current in a superconductor-ferromagnet structure?,"  We study two different superconductor-ferromagnet (S/F) structures. We
consider first a Josephson junction which consists of two S/F bilayers
separated by an insulating layer. We show that for an antiparallel alignment of
the magnetization in the two F layers the Josephson critical current $I_c$
increases with increasing exchange field $h$. The second system we consider is
a S/F structure with a local inhomogeneity of the magnetization in the
ferromagnet near the S/F interface. Due to the proximity effect not only a
singlet but also a triplet component of the superconducting condensate is
induced in the ferromagnet. The latter penetrates over the length
$\sqrt{D/\epsilon}$ ($D$ is the diffusion coefficient and $\epsilon$ the
energy). In the case of temperatures of the order of the Thouless energy this
length is comparable to the length of the ferromagnet. This long-range
penetration leads to a significant increase of the ferromagnet conductance
below the superconducting critical temperature $T_c$. Contrary to the case of
the singlet component, the contribution to the conductance due to the odd
triplet component is not zero at $T = 0$ and $V = 0$ ($V$ is the voltage) and
decays with increasing temperature T in a monotonic way
"
What is the index theory used to solve linear self-adjoint operator equations?,"  We will first establish an index theory for linear self-adjoint operator
equations. And then with the help of this index theory we will discuss
existence and multiplicity of solutions for asymptotically linear operator
equations by making use of the dual variational methods and Morse theory.
Finally, some interesting examples concerning second order Hamiltonian systems,
first order Hamiltonian systems and elliptical partial differential equations
will be presented to illustrate our results.
"
What is the relationship between the equipartition magnetic field and the Inverse Compton value in the radio and X-ray lobes of the radio galaxy Pictor A?,"  A new XMM observation has made possible a detailed study of both lobes of the
radio galaxy Pictor A. Their X-ray emission is of non thermal origin and due to
Inverse Compton scattering of the microwave background photons by relativistic
electrons in the lobes, as previously found. In both lobes, the equipartition
magnetic field (Beq) is bigger than the Inverse Compton value (Bic), calculated
from the radio and X-ray flux ratio. The Beq/Bic ratio never gets below 2, in
spite of the large number of reasonable assumptions tested to calculate Beq,
suggesting a lobe energetic dominated by particles. The X-ray data quality is
good enough to allow a spatially resolved analysis. Our study shows that Bic
varies through the lobes. It appears to increase behind the hot spots. On the
contrary, a rather uniform distribution of the particles is observed. As a
consequence, the radio flux density variation along the lobes appears to be
mainly driven by magnetic field changes.
"
usually used for the analysis of the income distribution.,"  This paper presents a model of the dynamics of the wage income distribution.
"
What are the conditions for a graph to have a nowhere-zero 4-flow?,"  Identities obtained by elementary finite Fourier analysis are used to derive
a variety of evaluations of the Tutte polynomial of a graph G at certain points
(a,b) where (a-1)(b-1) equals 2 or 4. These evaluations are expressed in terms
of eulerian subgraphs of G and the size of subgraphs modulo 2,3,4 or 6. In
particular, a graph is found to have a nowhere-zero 4-flow if and only if there
is a correlation between the event that three subgraphs A,B,C chosen uniformly
at random have pairwise eulerian symmetric differences and the event that the
integer part of (|A| + |B| + |C|) / 3 is even. Some further evaluations of the
Tutte polynomial at points (a,b) where (a-1)(b-1) = 3 are also given that
illustrate the unifying power of the methods used. The connection between
results of Matiyasevich, Alon and Tarsi and Onn is highlighted by indicating
how they may all be derived by the techniques adopted in this paper.
"
What are the time dependent backgrounds in String theory?,"  These lecture notes provide a short review of the status of time dependent
backgrounds in String theory, and in particular those that contain space-like
singularities. Despite considerable efforts, we do not have yet a full and
compelling picture of such backgrounds. We review some of the various attempts
to understand these singularities via generalizations of the BKL dynamics,
using worldsheet methods and using non-perturbative tools such as the AdS/CFT
correspondence and M(atrix) theory. These lecture notes are based on talks
given at Cargese 06 and the dead-sea conference 06.
"
What are the effects of injecting nanosilica on the growth of a baculovirus in a silkworm?,"  Various types of surface functionalized nanosilica (50-60 nm size with 3-10
nm inner pore size range) have been used to kill insect pests by sucking up
cuticular lipids and breaking the water barrier. We have also utilized
nanosilica for mopping up host lipids induced by the malarial parasite, P.
gallinaceum in poultry birds; VLDL cholesterol and serum triglycerides are
brought back to the normal level with a concomitant check in parasite growth.
While this work continues, we have explored another more convenient system,
silkworm (Bombyx mori) that is frequently decimated by a baculovirus, NPV for
which no antidote is known so far. Here, too, viral infection enhances host
lipids. Eight different types of nanosilica were injected in the virus infected
silkworm (batches of 10 worms) after ensuring 100% survival up to cocoon
formation in control larvae (injected with the same volume of ethanol, the
medium of nanosilica). Of these 8, AL60102 and AL60106, have the most marked
effect on infected silkworm, both as prophylactic and pharmaceutical agents.
Normal larvae injected with these nanosilica survive up to cocoon formation.
"
What is the singlet-triplet spin dynamics in an array of isolated double well potentials?,"  We describe a novel approach to prepare, detect and characterize magnetic
quantum phases in ultra-cold spinor atoms loaded in optical superlattices. Our
technique makes use of singlet-triplet spin manipulations in an array of
isolated double well potentials in analogy to recently demonstrated quantum
control in semiconductor quantum dots. We also discuss the many-body
singlet-triplet spin dynamics arising from coherent coupling between nearest
neighbor double wells and derive an effective description for such system. We
use it to study the generation of complex magnetic states by adiabatic and
non-equilibrium dynamics.
"
What is the mechanism of phase separation in multiband superconductors?,"  A two-band Hubbard model is used to describe the band structure and phase
separation (PS) in multiband superconductors, especially in cuprates. We
predict a large peak in the density of states at the Fermi level in the case of
optimum doping, corresponding to the minimum energy difference between the
centers of two hole bands. For strong interband hybridization, a
metal-insulator transition occurs near this optimum doping level. We suggest a
mechanism of PS related to the redistribution of holes between two Hubbard
bands rather than to the usual antiferromagnetic correlations. We show that the
critical superconducting temperature $T_c$ can be about its maximum value
within a wide range of doping levels due to PS.

What are the analogies between laser-driven multilevel atomic or molecular systems and the dynamics of a single electron in a chain of tunnel coupled quantum dots?,"  We consider the dynamics of a single electron in a chain of tunnel coupled
quantum dots, exploring the formal analogies of this system with some of the
laser-driven multilevel atomic or molecular systems studied by Bruce W. Shore
and collaborators over the last 30 years. In particular, we describe two
regimes for achieving complete coherent transfer of population in such a
multistate system. In the first regime, by carefully arranging the coupling
strengths, the flow of population between the states of the system can be made
periodic in time. In the second regime, by employing a ""counterintuitive""
sequence of couplings, the coherent population trapping eigenstate of the
system can be rotated from the initial to the final desired state, which is an
equivalent of the STIRAP technique for atoms or molecules. Our results may be
useful in future quantum computation schemes.
"
What is the treatment of the problem in which only the recombination of thermal partons is considered?,"  Azimuthal anisotropy in heavy-ion collisions is studied by taking into
account the ridges generated by semi-hard scattering of intermediate-momentum
partons, which can be sensitive to the initial spatial configuration of the
medium in non-central collisions. In a simple treatment of the problem where
the recombination of only thermal partons is considered, analytical formulas
can be derived that yield results in accord with the data on v_2 for p_T <1-2
GeV/c. Centrality dependence is described by a geometrical factor. Ridge
phenomenology is used to determine the initial slopes of v_2 at low p_T for
both pion and proton. For higher p_T, shower partons from high-p_T jets must be
included, but they are not considered here.
"
What is the relevance of the quantum Boltzmann equations to the leptogenesis scenario?,"  It has been recently shown that the quantum Boltzmann equations may be
relevant for the leptogenesis scenario. In particular, they lead to a
time-dependent CP asymmetry which depends upon the previous dynamics of the
system. This memory effect in the CP asymmetry is particularly important in
resonant leptogenesis where the asymmetry is generated by the decays of nearly
mass-degenerate right-handed neutrinos. We study the impact of the nontrivial
time evolution of the CP asymmetry in resonant leptogenesis, both in the
one-flavour case and with flavour effects included. We show that significant
qualitative and quantitative differences arise with respect to the case in
which the time dependence of the CP asymmetry is neglected.
"
What are the results of introducing a double coset graph for dealing with the ``instability'' of certain double cosets in the complex reflection group case?,"  How far can the elementary description of centralizers of parabolic
subalgebras of Hecke algebras of finite real reflection groups be generalized
to the complex reflection group case? In this paper we begin to answer this
question by establishing results in two directions. First, under conditions
closely analogous to those existing for the real case, we give explicit
relations between coefficients in an element centralizing a generator. Second,
we introduce a tool for dealing with a major challenge of the complex case --
the ``instability'' of certain double cosets -- through the definition and use
of a double coset graph. We use these results to find integral bases for the
centralizers of generators as well as the centres of the Hecke algebras of
types $G_4$ and $G(4,1,2)$.
  Keywords: complex reflection group; Hecke algebra; centre; centralizer;
modular; double coset.
"
What is the open problem of determining the graded Betti numbers for fat point subschemes supported at general points of the projective plane?,"  We consider the open problem of determining the graded Betti numbers for fat
point subschemes supported at general points of the projective plane. We relate
this problem to the open geometric problem of determining the splitting type of
the pullback of the cotangent bundle on the plane to the normalization of
certain rational plane curves. We give a conjecture for the graded Betti
numbers which would determine them in all degrees but one for every fat point
subscheme supported at general points of the plane. We also prove our Betti
number conjecture in a broad range of cases. An appendix discusses many more
cases in which our conjecture has been verified computationally and provides a
new and more efficient computational approach for computing graded Betti
numbers in certain degrees. It also demonstrates how to derive explicit
conjectural values for the Betti numbers and how to compute splitting types.
"
What is the Bayes' formula for the optimal filter used in nonlinear filtering of a random field?,"  The problem of nonlinear filtering of a random field observed in the presence
of a noise, modeled by a persistent fractional Brownian sheet of Hurst index
$(H_1,H_2)$ with $0.5<H_1,H_2<1$, is studied and a suitable version of the
Bayes' formula for the optimal filter is obtained. Two types of spatial
""fractional"" analogues of the Duncan-Mortensen-Zakai equation are also derived:
one tracks evolution of the unnormalized optimal filter along an arbitrary
""monotone increasing"" (in the sense of partial ordering in $\mathbb{R}^2$)
one-dimensional curve in the plane, while the other describes dynamics of the
filter along the paths that are truly two-dimensional. Although the paper deals
with the two-dimensional parameter space, the presented approach and results
extend to $d$-parameter random fields with arbitrary $d\geq 3$.
"
What is the quantum multibaker map used to study transport phenomena in chaotic systems?,"  By studying a modified (unbiased) quantum multibaker map, we were able to
obtain a {\em finite} asymptotic quantum current without a classical analogue.
This result suggests a general method for the design of {\em purely} quantum
ratchets, and sheds light on the investigation of the mechanisms leading to net
transport generation by breaking symmetries of quantum systems. Moreover, we
propose the multibaker map as a resource to study directed transport phenomena
in chaotic systems without bias. In fact, this is a paradigmatic model in
classical and quantum chaos, but also in statistical mechanics.
"
What is the Boltzmann kinetic equation used in the solution of a multicomponent system?,"  We present the perturbative solution of the multicomponent Boltzmann kinetic
equation based on the set of observables including the hydrodynamic velocity
and temperature for each component. The solution is obtained by modifying the
formal density scaling scheme by Enskog, such that the density of each
component is scaled independently. As a result we obtain the species momentum
and energy balance equations with the source terms describing the transfer of
corresponding quantities between different components. In the zero order
approximation those are the Euler equations with the momentum and heat
diffusion included in the form of the classical Maxwell-Stefan diffusion terms.
The first order approximation results in equations of a Navier-Stokes type with
the partial viscosity and heat conductivity including only the correlations of
the particles of the same component. The first order corrections to the
Maxwell-Stefan terms as well as the contributions bilinear in gradients and
differences of observables are calculated. The first order momentum source term
is shown to include thermal diffusion. The nondiagonal (in component indexes)
components of viscosity and heat conductivity appear as second order
contributions.
"
What is the significance of the structural CAS parameters in the context of galaxy evolution and morphology?,"  A release of multicolor broad band (BVRI) photometry for a subsample of 44
isolated spirals drawn from the Catalogue of Isolated Galaxies (CIG) is
presented. Total magnitudes and colors at various circular apertures, as well
as some global structural/morphological parameters are estimated. Morphology is
reevaluated through optical and sharp/filtered R band images, (B-I) color index
maps, and archive near-IR JHK images from the Two-Micron Survey. The CAS
structural parameters (Concentration, Asymmetry, and Clumpiness) were
calculated from the images in each one of the bands. The fraction of galaxies
with well identified optical/near-IR bars (SB) is 63%, while a 17% more shows
evidence of weak or suspected bars (SAB). The sample average value of the
maximum bar ellipticity is 0.4. Half of the galaxies in the sample shows rings.
We identify two candidates for isolated galaxies with disturbed morphology. The
structural CAS parameters change with the observed band, and the tendencies
they follow with the morphological type and global color are more evident in
the redder bands. In any band, the major difference between our isolated
spirals and a sample of interacting spirals is revealed in the A-S plane. A
deep and uniformly observed sample of isolated galaxies is intended for various
purposes including (i) comparative studies of environmental effects, (ii)
confronting model predictions of galaxy evolution and (iii) evaluating the
change of galaxy properties with redshift.
"
What is the relationship between the amplitude of intensity modulation and the incident polarization state?,"  The nature of changes in the interference pattern caused by the presence of
polarization-changing elements in one or both beams of an interferometer, in
particular those caused by an effective optical activity due to passage of a
polarized beam through a coiled optical fiber are clarified. It is pointed out
that for an incident state that is not circularly polarized so that the two
interfering beams go to different polarization states, there is an observable
nonzero Pancharatnam phase shift between them which depends on the incident
polarization state and on the solid angle subtended by the track of the
$\vec{k}$-vector at the centre of the sphere of k-vectors. The behaviour of
this phase shift is singular when the two interfering states are nearly
orthogonal. It is shown that for zero path difference between the two beams,
the amplitude of intensity modulation as a function of optical activity is
independent of the incident polarization state.
"
What is the action principle used to derive gauge transformations of the full vacuum-to-vacuum transition amplitude?,"  The action principle is used to derive, by an entirely algebraic approach,
gauge transformations of the full vacuum-to-vacuum transition amplitude
(generating functional) from the Coulomb gauge to arbitrary covariant gauges
and in turn to the celebrated Fock-Schwinger (FS) gauge for the abelian (QED)
gauge theory without recourse to path integrals or to commutation rules and
without making use of delta functionals. The interest in the FS gauge, in
particular, is that it leads to Faddeev-Popov ghosts-free non-abelian gauge
theories. This method is expected to be applicable to non-abelian gauge
theories including supersymmetric ones.
"
What is the relationship between the number of cusps and the density of the adeles of $\mathbb{Q}$ for a pseudomodular Fricke group?,"  A pseudomodular group is a finite coarea nonarithmetic Fuchsian group whose
cusp set is exactly $\mathbb{P}^1(\mathbb{Q})$. Long and Reid constructed
finitely many of these by considering Fricke groups, i.e., those that
uniformize one-cusped tori. We prove that a zonal Fricke group with rational
cusps is pseudomodular if and only if its cusp set is dense in the finite
adeles of $\mathbb{Q}$. We then deduce that infinitely many such Fricke groups
are not pseudomodular.

"What are the results of IBM-1 calculations for the fission products of $^{108,110,112}$Ru?","  IBM-1} calculations for the fission products $^{108,110,112}$Ru have been
carried out. The even-even isotopes of Ru can be described as transitional
nuclei situated between the U(5) (spherical vibrator) and SO(6)
($\gamma$-unstable rotor) symmetries of the Interacting Boson Model. At first,
a Hamiltonian with only one- and two-body terms has been used. Excitation
energies and $B$(E2) ratios of gamma transitions have been calculated. A
satisfactory agreement has been obtained, with the exception of the odd-even
staggering in the quasi-$\gamma$ bands of $^{110,112}$Ru. The observed pattern
is rather similar to the one for a rigid triaxial rotor. A calculation based on
a Hamiltonian with three-body terms was able to remove this discrepancy. The
relation between the IBM and the triaxial rotor model was also examined.
"
What are the results of the spectroscopic verification of a sample of LSB galaxy candidates in the HDF-S field?,"  With this study we aim at the spectroscopic verification of a photometrically
selected sample of Low Surface Brightness (LSB) galaxy candidates in a field
around the Hubble Deep Field-South (HDF-S). The sample helps to extend the
parameter space for LSB galaxies to lower central surface brightnesses and to
provide better estimates on the volume densities of these objects. To derive
redshifts for the LSB candidates, long-slit spectra were obtained covering a
spectral range from 3400{\AA} to 7500{\AA}. The observations have been obtained
using the ESO 3.6m telescope, equipped with the EFOSC2 spectrograph. From the
measured radial velocities, distances could be estimated. With this distance
information, it is possible to differentiate between true LSB galaxies and
higher redshift High Surface Brightness (HSB) galaxies which may contaminate
the sample. A correction for the surface brightnesses can then be applied,
accounting for the cosmological dimming effect (``Tolman Dimming''). We show
that ~70% of the LSB candidates, selected based on their location in the
color-color space, are real LSB galaxies. Their position in the color-color
diagrams, therefore, indicate that the LSB galaxies have a different stellar
population mix resulting from a different star formation history compared to
HSBs. Our LSB galaxy sample consists only of large disk galaxies with
scale-length between 2.5kpc and 7.3kpc. We confirm the flat central surface
brightness distribution of previous surveys and extend this distribution down
to central surface brightnesses of 27 B mag arcsec^-2.
"
What are the formal documents of a simple programming language in the calculus of inductive constructions?,"  We describe several views of the semantics of a simple programming language
as formal documents in the calculus of inductive constructions that can be
verified by the Coq proof system. Covered aspects are natural semantics,
denotational semantics, axiomatic semantics, and abstract interpretation.
Descriptions as recursive functions are also provided whenever suitable, thus
yielding a a verification condition generator and a static analyser that can be
run inside the theorem prover for use in reflective proofs. Extraction of an
interpreter from the denotational semantics is also described. All different
aspects are formally proved sound with respect to the natural semantics
specification.
"
How do the magnetic to total power ratio and the collimation of the outflow affect the dynamics of the magnetar-driven bubble?,"  We model the interaction between the wind from a newly formed rapidly
rotating magnetar and the surrounding supernova shock and host star. The
dynamics is modeled using the two-dimensional, axisymmetric thin-shell
equations. In the first ~10-100 seconds after core collapse the magnetar
inflates a bubble of plasma and magnetic fields behind the supernova shock. The
bubble expands asymmetrically because of the pinching effect of the toroidal
magnetic field, just as in the analogous problem of the evolution of pulsar
wind nebulae. The degree of asymmetry depends on E_mag/E_tot. The correct value
of E_mag/E_tot is uncertain because of uncertainties in the conversion of
magnetic energy into kinetic energy at large radii in relativistic winds; we
argue, however, that bubbles inflated by newly formed magnetars are likely to
be significantly more magnetized than their pulsar counterparts. We show that
for a ratio of magnetic to total power supplied by the central magnetar
L_mag/L_tot ~ 0.1 the bubble expands relatively spherically. For L_mag/L_tot ~
0.3, however, most of the pressure in the bubble is exerted close to the
rotation axis, driving a collimated outflow out through the host star. This can
account for the collimation inferred from observations of long-duration
gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). Outflows from magnetars become increasingly
magnetically dominated at late times, due to the decrease in neutrino-driven
mass loss as the young neutron star cools. We thus suggest that the
magnetar-driven bubble initially expands relatively spherically, enhancing the
energy of the associated supernova, while at late times it becomes
progressively more collimated, producing the GRB.
"
What are the implications for the domain size in ferroelectric films for the ferroelectric domain size to be linked to the fractal dimensionality?,"  We have analyzed the morphology of ferroelectric domains in very thin films
of multiferroic BiFeO3. Unlike the more common stripe domains observed in
thicker films BiFeO3 or in other ferroics, the domains tend not to be straight,
but irregular in shape, with significant domain wall roughening leading to a
fractal dimensionality. Also contrary to what is usually observed in other
ferroics, the domain size appears not to scale as the square root of the film
thickness. A model is proposed in which the observed domain size as a function
of film thickness can be directly linked to the fractal dimension of the
domains.
"
What is the rate of convergence of posterior distributions in density estimation problems?,"  We study the rate of convergence of posterior distributions in density
estimation problems for log-densities in periodic Sobolev classes characterized
by a smoothness parameter p. The posterior expected density provides a
nonparametric estimation procedure attaining the optimal minimax rate of
convergence under Hellinger loss if the posterior distribution achieves the
optimal rate over certain uniformity classes. A prior on the density class of
interest is induced by a prior on the coefficients of the trigonometric series
expansion of the log-density. We show that when p is known, the posterior
distribution of a Gaussian prior achieves the optimal rate provided the prior
variances die off sufficiently rapidly. For a mixture of normal distributions,
the mixing weights on the dimension of the exponential family are assumed to be
bounded below by an exponentially decreasing sequence. To avoid the use of
infinite bases, we develop priors that cut off the series at a
sample-size-dependent truncation point. When the degree of smoothness is
unknown, a finite mixture of normal priors indexed by the smoothness parameter,
which is also assigned a prior, produces the best rate. A rate-adaptive
estimator is derived.
"
What are the macroscopic parameters of Fokker-Planck flows obtained from a spectral decomposition?,"  In this paper we proceed with investigation of connections between Fokker -
Planck equation and continuum mechanics. We base upon expressions from our work
[2], based upon the spectral decomposition of Fokker - Planck equation
solution. In this decomposition we preserve only terms with the smallest
degrees of damping. We find, that macroscopic parameters of Fokker-Planck
flows, obtained in this way, satisfy the set of conservation laws of classic
hydrodynamics. The expression for stresses (30) contains additional term - this
term is negligible in big times limit. We proved also, that the velocities
field alone satisfy Burgers equation without mass forces - but with some
additional term. This term is also negligible in big times limit. For the zero
degree theory, considered in [1], there are no additional terms. But this
theory is valid only for the potential velocities field, fully deductible from
density - the potential is proportional to density logarithm. In this theory we
can not specify initial conditions for velocities independently from density.
Taking in account of the next degree terms could partly solve this problem, but
result in some loss of exactness.
"
What are the classification methods used to analyze condition monitoring process?,"  Condition monitoring techniques are described in this chapter. Two aspects of
condition monitoring process are considered: (1) feature extraction; and (2)
condition classification. Feature extraction methods described and implemented
are fractals, Kurtosis and Mel-frequency Cepstral Coefficients. Classification
methods described and implemented are support vector machines (SVM), hidden
Markov models (HMM), Gaussian mixture models (GMM) and extension neural
networks (ENN). The effectiveness of these features were tested using SVM, HMM,
GMM and ENN on condition monitoring of bearings and are found to give good
results.
"
What are the advantages of the presented technique for the segregation of different types of atoms?,"  Two-component submonolayer growth on triangular lattice is qualitatively
studied by kinetic Monte Carlo techniques. The hopping barrier governing
surface diffusion of the atoms is estimated with an improved formula and using
realistic pair interaction potentials. Realistic degrees of freedoms enhancing
the surface diffusion of atoms are also introduced. The main advantages of the
presented technique are the reduced number of free parameters and the clear
diffusion activated mechanism for the segregation of different types of atoms.
The potential of this method is exemplified by reproducing (i) vacancy and
stacking fault related phase-boundary creation and dynamics; (ii) a special
co-deposition and segregation process where the segregated atoms of the second
component surrounds the islands formed by the first type of atoms.
"
What is the Weyl operator basis in the context of entanglement of special parameterized two-qubit and two-qutrit states?,"  We present three different matrix bases that can be used to decompose density
matrices of d--dimensional quantum systems, so-called qudits: the generalized
Gell-Mann matrix basis, the polarization operator basis, and the Weyl operator
basis. Such a decomposition can be identified with a vector --the Bloch vector,
i.e. a generalization of the well known qubit case-- and is a convenient
expression for comparison with measurable quantities and for explicit
calculations avoiding the handling of large matrices. We consider the important
case of an isotropic two--qudit state and decompose it according to each basis.
Investigating the geometry of entanglement of special parameterized two--qubit
and two--qutrit states, in particular we calculate the Hilbert--Schmidt measure
of entanglement, we find that the Weyl operator basis is the optimal choice
since it is closely connected to the entanglement of the considered states.
"
What is the limit on the electron neutrino effective charge radius?,"  We have obtained a new limit on the electron neutrino effective charge radius
from a new evaluation of the weak mixing angle by a combined fit of all
electron-(anti)neutrino electron elastic scattering measurements. Weak mixing
angle is found to be sin^2 theta_W=0.259 \pm 0.025 in the low energy regime
below 100 MeV. The electron neutrino charge radius squared is bounded to be in
the range -0.13 10^-32 cm^2 < r^2 < 3.32 10^-32 cm^2 at 90 % C.L. Both results
improve previously published analyses. We also discuss perspectives of future
experiments to improve these constraints.
"
What is the condition for the non-equilibrium work relation to be valid?,"  We discuss the conditions for which the non-equilibrium work relation is

"
What are the effects of the dimensional reduction on the muon spin relaxation rate?,"  We have performed depth dependent muon spin rotation/relaxation studies of
the dynamics of single layer films of {\it Au}Fe and {\it Cu}Mn spin glasses as
a function of thickness and of its behavior as a function of distance from the
vacuum interface (5-70 nm). A significant reduction in the muon spin relaxation
rate as a function of temperature with respect to the bulk material is observed
when the muons are stopped near (5-10 nm) the surface of the sample. A similar
reduction is observed for the whole sample if the thickness is reduced to e.g.
20 nm and less. This reflects an increased impurity spin dynamics (incomplete
freezing) close to the surface although the freezing temperature is only
modestly affected by the dimensional reduction.
"
What are the implications of the predominance of orbital periods in the 3-4.5 h range for the theory of CV evolution?,"  [Abridged] We present time-series optical photometry of five new CVs
identified by the Hamburg Quasar Survey. The eclipses observed in HS 0129+2933,
HS 0220+0603, and HS 0455+8315 provided very accurate orbital periods of
3.35129827(65), 3.58098501(34), and 3.56937674(26) h, respectively. HS
0805+3822 shows grazing eclipses and has a likely orbital period of 3.2169(2)
h. Time-resolved optical spectroscopy of the new CVs (with the exception of HS
0805+3822) is also presented. Radial velocity studies provided an orbital
period of 3.55 h for HS 1813+6122, which allowed us to identify the observed
photometric signal at 3.39 h as a negative superhump wave. The spectroscopic
behaviour clearly identifies these new CVs as new SW Sextantis stars. These new
additions increase the number of known SW Sex stars to 35. Almost 40 per cent
of the total SW Sex population do not show eclipses, invalidating the
requirement of eclipses as a defining characteristic of the class and the
models based on a high orbital inclination geometry alone. On the other hand,
the predominance of orbital periods in the narrow 3-4.5 h range is becoming
more pronounced. In fact, almost half the CVs which populate the 3-4.5 h period
interval are definite members of the class. These statistics are confirmed by
our results from the Hamburg Quasar Survey CVs. Remarkably, 54 per cent of the
Hamburg nova-like variables have been identified as SW Sex stars with orbital
periods in the 3-4.5 h range. The observation of this pile-up of systems close
to the upper boundary of the period gap is difficult to reconcile with the
standard theory of CV evolution, as the SW Sex stars are believed to have the
highest mass transfer rates among CVs. Finally, we review the full range of
common properties that the SW Sex stars exhibit.
"
What are the features of the X-ray light-curves that are naturally accommodated by the standard forward-shock model?,"  Scattering of the forward-shock synchrotron emission by a relativistic
outflow located behind the leading blast-wave may produce an X-ray emission
brighter than that coming directly from the forward-shock and may explain four
features displayed by Swift X-ray afterglows: flares, plateaus (slow decays),
chromatic light-curve breaks, and fast post-plateau decays. For a cold
scattering outflow, the reflected flux overshines the primary one if the
scattering outflow is nearly baryon-free and highly relativistic. These two
requirements can be relaxed if the scattering outflow is energized by weak
internal shocks, so that the incident forward-shock photons are also
inverse-Compton scattered, in addition to bulk-scattering. Sweeping-up of the
photons left behind by the forward shock naturally yields short X-ray flares.
Owing to the boost in photon energy produced by bulk-scattering scattering, the
reflected emission is more likely to overshine that coming directly from the
forward shock at higher photon energies, yielding light-curve plateaus and
breaks that appear only in the X-ray. The brightness, shape, and decay of the
X-ray light-curve plateau depend on the radial distribution of the scatterer's
Lorentz factor and mass-flux. Chromatic X-ray light-curve breaks and sharp
post-plateau decays cannot be accommodated by the direct forward-shock emission
and argue in favour of the scattering-outflow model proposed here. On the other
hand, the X-ray afterglows without plateaus, those with achromatic breaks, and
those with very long-lived power-law decays are more naturally accommodated by
the standard forward-shock model. Thus the diversity of X-ray light-curves
arises from the interplay of the scattered and direct forward-shock emissions.
"
What is the new family of angular excess functions used to measure convexity and extrinsic curvature of convex hypersurfaces?,"  In this paper, we study open complete metric spaces with non-negative
curvature. Among other things, we establish an extension of Perelman's soul
theorem for possibly singular spaces: ""Let X be a complete, non-compact, finite
dimensional Alexandrov space with non-negative curvature. Suppose that X has no
boundary and has positive curvature on a non-empty open subset. Then X must be
a contractible space"". The proof of this result uses the detailed analysis of
concavity of distance functions and Busemann functions on singular spaces with
non-negative curvature. We will introduce a family of angular excess functions
to measure convexity and extrinsic curvature of convex hypersurfaces in
singular spaces. We also derive a new comparison for trapezoids in
non-negatively curved spaces, which led to desired convexity estimates for the
proof of our new soul theorem.
"
What is the relationship between quantum Micro and classical Macro?,"  The mutual relation between quantum Micro and classical Macro is clarified by
a unified formulation of instruments describing measurement processes and the
associated amplification processes, from which some perspective towards a
description of emergence processes of spacetime structure is suggested.

"What is the asymptotic formula for the number of solutions to the congruence $f(x,y) \equiv a \pmod p$ in positive integers $x \le X$, $y \le Y$?","  For a prime $p$ and an absolutely irreducible modulo $p$ polynomial $f(U,V)
\in \Z[U,V]$ we obtain an asymptotic formulas for the number of solutions to
the congruence $f(x,y) \equiv a \pmod p$ in positive integers $x \le X$, $y \le
Y$, with the additional condition $\gcd(x,y)=1$. Such solutions have a natural
interpretation as solutions which are visible from the origin. These formulas
are derived on average over $a$ for a fixed prime $p$, and also on average over
$p$ for a fixed integer $a$.
"
What is the temperature dependence of Coulomb Oscillations in polySiNW?,"  Investigation of electrical conduction in polysilicon nanowires (polySiNW)
with nanograins (5 to 20nm), based on Monte Carlo (MC) simulations and
electrical measurements from 4K to 300K are presented. Some irregular Coulomb
Oscillations (CO) are observed at temperatures lower than 200K showing several
period widths due to the random distribution in grain size (5-20nm). A
remarkable result consists in more effective oscillations observed at
intermediate range of temperatures (between 25K and 150K) and high drain
voltages. The temperature dependence of COs is explained by the fact that in a
multiple asymmetric dot system at low temperature, COs are observed not at the
lowest but at an intermediate temperature range, whereas the drain voltage
dependence is due to an enhanced non-resonant tunneling. MC simulations have
confirmed experimental observations.
"
What are the effects of scalar impurities on the spin susceptibility?,"  We calculate the spin susceptibility of a superconductor without inversion
symmetry, both in the clean and disordered cases. The susceptibility has a
large residual value at zero temperature, which is further enhanced in the
presence of scalar impurities.
"
What are the shapes of the dunes on Mars?,"  We present the first calculation of saltation transport and dune formation on
Mars and compare it to real dunes. We find that the rate at which grains are
entrained into saltation on Mars is one order of magnitude higher than on
Earth. With this fundamental novel ingredient, we reproduce the size and
different shapes of Mars dunes, and give an estimate for the wind velocity on
Mars.
"
What is the Lagrange parameters used to describe the dynamics of an interacting expanding system in the ideal gas limit?,"  A statistical treatment of finite unbound systems in the presence of
collective motions is presented and applied to a classical Lennard-Jones
Hamiltonian, numerically simulated through molecular dynamics. In the ideal gas
limit, the flow dynamics can be exactly re-casted into effective time-dependent
Lagrange parameters acting on a standard Gibbs ensemble with an extra total
energy conservation constraint. Using this same ansatz for the low density
freeze-out configurations of an interacting expanding system, we show that the
presence of flow can have a sizeable effect on the microstate distribution.
"
What is the generalized $q$-translation of the Bessel Hahn Exton function?,"  In this paper we study the positivity of the generalized $q$-translation
associated with the $q$-Bessel Hahn Exton function which is deduced by a new

"
What is the enhancement of strange baryons in Au+Au collisions compared to pp interactions?,"  We report on the observed differences in production rates of strange and
multi-strange baryons in Au+Au collisions at sqrts = 200 GeV compared to pp
interactions at the same energy. The strange baryon yields in Au+Au collisions,
then scaled down by the number of participating nucleons, are enhanced relative
to those measured in pp reactions. The enhancement observed increases with the
strangeness content of the baryon, and increases for all strange baryons with
collision centrality. The enhancement is qualitatively similar to that observed
at lower collision energy sqrts =17.3 GeV. The previous observations are for
the bulk production, while at intermediate pT, 1 < pT< 4 GeV/c, the strange
baryons even exceed binary scaling from pp yields.

What are the limiting aperture effects taken into account in the calculation of particle trajectories?,"  Computing the trajectories of particles in generic beamlines is an important
ingredient of experimental particle physics, in particular regarding near-beam
detectors. A new tool, Hector, has been built for such calculations, using the
transfer matrix approach and energy corrections. The limiting aperture effects
are also taken into account. As an illustration, the tool was used to simulate
the LHC beamlines, in particular around the high luminosity interaction points
(IPs), and validated with results of the Mad-X simulator. The LHC beam
profiles, trajectories and beta functions are presented. Assuming certain
forward proton detector scenarios around the IP5, acceptance plots, irradiation
doses and chromaticity grids are produced. Furthermore, the reconstruction of
proton kinematic variables at the IP (energy and angle) is studied as well as
the impact of the misalignment of beamline elements.
"
How is the local coupling obtained as a function of position using a layer-stripping type method?,"  We consider the inverse scattering problem associated with any number of
interacting modes in one-dimensional structures. The coupling between the modes
is contradirectional in addition to codirectional, and may be distributed
continuously or in discrete points. The local coupling as a function of
position is obtained from reflection data using a layer-stripping type method,
and the separate identification of the contradirectional and codirectional
coupling is obtained using matrix factorization. Ambiguities are discussed in
detail, and different {\it a priori} information that can resolve the
ambiguities is suggested. The method is exemplified by applications to
multimode optical waveguides with quasi-periodical perturbations.
"
What is the magnetic field effect on the magnetization of the GdBaMn_{2}O_{5.0}?,"  The magnetic properties of GdBaMn_{2}O_{5.0}, which exhibits charge ordering,
are studied from 2 to 400 K using single crystals. In a small magnetic field
applied along the easy axis, the magnetization M shows a temperature-induced
reversal which is sometimes found in ferrimagnets. In a large magnetic field,
on the other hand, a sharp change in the slope of M(T) coming from an unusual
turnabout of the magnetization of the Mn sublattices is observed. Those
observations are essentially explained by a molecular field theory which
highlights the role of delicate magnetic interactions between Gd^{3+} ions and
the antiferromagnetically coupled Mn^{2+}/Mn^{3+} sublattices.
"
What is the Hilbert space of bound states in the Enright-Howe-Wallach classification diagram?,"  For each integer $n\ge 2$, we demonstrate that a 2n-dimensional generalized
MICZ-Kepler problem has an $\widetilde{\mr{Spin}}(2, 2n+1)$ dynamical symmetry
which extends the manifest $\mr{Spin}(2n)$ symmetry. The Hilbert space of bound
states is shown to form a unitary highest weight $\widetilde{\mr{Spin}}(2,
2n+1)$-module which occurs at the first reduction point in the
Enright-Howe-Wallach classification diagram for the unitary highest weight
modules. As a byproduct, we get a simple geometric realization for such a
unitary highest weight $\widetilde{\mr{Spin}}(2, 2n+1)$-module.
"
What are the key differences in the ignition delay times of cyclohexane-oxygen-argon and cyclopentane-oxygen-argon mixtures?,"  Ignition delay times of cyclohexane-oxygen-argon and
cyclopentane-oxygen-argon mixtures have been measured in a shock tube, the
onset of ignition being detected by OH radical emission. Mixtures contained 0.5
or 1 % of hydrocarbon for equivalence ratios ranging from 0.5 to 2. Reflected
shock waves allowed temperatures from 1230 to 1800 K and pressures from 7.3 to
9.5 atm to be obtained. These measurements have shown that cyclopentane is much
less reactive than cyclohexane, as for a given temperature the observed
autoignition delay times were about ten times higher for the C5 compound
compared to the C6. Detailed mechanisms for the combustion of cyclohexane and
cyclopentane have been proposed to reproduce these results. The elementary
steps included in the kinetic models of the oxidation of cyclanes are close to
those proposed to describe the oxidation of acyclic alkanes and alkenes.
Consequently, it has been possible to obtain these models by using an improved
version of software EXGAS, a computer package developed to perform the
automatic generation of detailed kinetic models for the gas-phase oxidation and
combustion of linear and branched alkanes and alkenes. Nevertheless, the
modelling of the oxidation of cyclanes requires to consider new types of
generic reactions, and especially to define new correlations for the estimation
of the rate constants. Ab initio calculations have been used to better know
some of the rate constants used in the case of cyclopentane. The main reaction
pathways have been derived from flow rate and sensitivity analyses.
"
What are the expectation values of the momentum in various bound states in quantum mechanics?,"  In quantum mechanics textbooks the momentum operator is defined in the
Cartesian coordinates and rarely the form of the momentum operator in spherical
polar coordinates is discussed. Consequently one always generalizes the
Cartesian prescription to other coordinates and falls in a trap. In this work
we introduce the difficulties one faces when the question of the momentum
operator in spherical polar coordinate comes. We have tried to point out most
of the elementary quantum mechanical results, related to the momentum operator,
which has coordinate dependence. We explicitly calculate the momentum
expectation values in various bound states and show that the expectation value
really turns out to be zero, a consequence of the fact that the momentum
expectation value is real. We comment briefly on the status of the angular
variables in quantum mechanics and the problems related in interpreting them as
dynamical variables. At the end, we calculate the Heisenberg's equation of
motion for the radial component of the momentum for the Hydrogen atom.
"
What is the relationship between quantum computers and quantum analogues of classical problems?,"  We study the computational strength of quantum particles (each of finite
dimensionality) arranged on a line. First, we prove that it is possible to
perform universal adiabatic quantum computation using a one-dimensional quantum
system (with 9 states per particle). This might have practical implications for
experimentalists interested in constructing an adiabatic quantum computer.
Building on the same construction, but with some additional technical effort
and 12 states per particle, we show that the problem of approximating the
ground state energy of a system composed of a line of quantum particles is
QMA-complete; QMA is a quantum analogue of NP. This is in striking contrast to
the fact that the analogous classical problem, namely, one-dimensional
MAX-2-SAT with nearest neighbor constraints, is in P. The proof of the
QMA-completeness result requires an additional idea beyond the usual techniques
in the area: Not all illegal configurations can be ruled out by local checks,
so instead we rule out such illegal configurations because they would, in the
future, evolve into a state which can be seen locally to be illegal. Our
construction implies (assuming the quantum Church-Turing thesis and that
quantum computers cannot efficiently solve QMA-complete problems) that there
are one-dimensional systems which take an exponential time to relax to their
ground states at any temperature, making them candidates for being
one-dimensional spin glasses.
"
What are the implications of the upper bound of the Picard number for the toric log Del Pezzo surfaces?,"  In this paper we give an upper bound for the Picard number of the rational
surfaces which resolve minimally the singularities of toric log Del Pezzo
surfaces of given index $\ell$. This upper bound turns out to be a quadratic
polynomial in the variable $\ell$.
"
What is the result of associating string operations to orientable surfaces?,"  Cohen and Godin constructed positive boundary topological quantum field
theory (TQFT) structure on the homology of free loop spaces of oriented closed
smooth manifolds by associating a certain operations called string operations
to orientable surfaces with parametrized boundaries. We show that all TQFT
string operations associated to surfaces of genus at least one vanish
identically. This is a simple consequence of properties of the loop coproduct
which will be discussed in detail. One interesting property is that the loop
coproduct is nontrivial only on the degree $d$ homology group of the connected
component of $LM$ consisting of contractible loops, where $d=\dim M$, with
values in the degree 0 homology group of constant loops. Thus the loop
coproduct behaves in a dramatically simpler way than the loop product.
"
What kind of patterns are characterized by the statistical measures of the intersection points of a planar curve and a Gaussian random field?,"  We study the intersection points of a fixed planar curve $\Gamma$ with the
nodal set of a translationally invariant and isotropic Gaussian random field
$\Psi(\bi{r})$ and the zeros of its normal derivative across the curve. The
intersection points form a discrete random process which is the object of this
study. The field probability distribution function is completely specified by
the correlation $G(|\bi{r}-\bi{r}'|) = <\Psi(\bi{r}) \Psi(\bi{r}')>$.
  Given an arbitrary $G(|\bi{r}-\bi{r}'|)$, we compute the two point
correlation function of the point process on the line, and derive other
statistical measures (repulsion, rigidity) which characterize the short and
long range correlations of the intersection points. We use these statistical
measures to quantitatively characterize the complex patterns displayed by
various kinds of nodal networks. We apply these statistics in particular to
nodal patterns of random waves and of eigenfunctions of chaotic billiards. Of
special interest is the observation that for monochromatic random waves, the
number variance of the intersections with long straight segments grows like $L
\ln L$, as opposed to the linear growth predicted by the percolation model,
which was successfully used to predict other long range nodal properties of
that field.
"
What are the key features of the progenitor distribution in the Millennium cosmological N-body simulation?,"  We present a simple and efficient empirical algorithm for constructing
dark-matter halo merger trees that reproduce the distribution of trees in the
Millennium cosmological $N$-body simulation. The generated trees are
significantly better than EPS trees. The algorithm is Markovian, and it
therefore fails to reproduce the non-Markov features of trees across short time
steps, except for an accurate fit to the evolution of the average main
progenitor. However, it properly recovers the full main progenitor distribution
and the joint distributions of all the progenitors over long-enough time steps,
$\Delta \omega \simeq \Delta z>0.5$, where $\omega \simeq 1.69/D(t)$ is the
self-similar time variable and $D(t)$ refers to the linear growth of density
fluctuations. We find that the main progenitor distribution is log-normal in
the variable $\sigma^2(M)$, the variance of linear density fluctuations in a
sphere encompassing mass $M$. The secondary progenitors are successfully drawn
one by one from the remaining mass using a similar distribution function. These
empirical findings may be clues to the underlying physics of merger-tree
statistics. As a byproduct, we provide useful, accurate analytic time-invariant
approximations for the main progenitor accretion history and for halo merger
rates.
"
Can a Genetic Algorithm be used to design a set of photonic crystals?,"  We investigate the use of a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to design a set of
photonic crystals (PCs) in one and two dimensions. Our flexible design
methodology allows us to optimize PC structures which are optimized for
specific objectives. In this paper, we report the results of several such
GA-based PC optimizations. We show that the GA performs well even in very
complex design spaces, and therefore has great potential for use as a robust
design tool in present and future applications.
"
What is the data acquisition based on a free-running data taking method?,"  GAW proposes a new approach for the detection and measurement of the
Cherenkov light produced by GeV/TeV gamma rays traversing the Earth atmosphere
which imposes specific requirements on the electronics design. The focal
surface of the GAW telescope consists of a matrix of multi-anode
photomultipliers. The large number of active channels (of the order of 10^5)
makes it basically a large UV sensitive digital camera with high resolution
imaging capability. The limited amount of space available, due to the large
number of channels, requires a compact design with minimal distance between the
elements of the focal surface. The front-end electronics uses the single
photoelectron counting technique to capture the Cherenkov light. The data
acquisition is based on free-running data taking method. Self-triggering
capability for each telescope is assured by detecting an excess of active
pixels, in a 10ns time frame, inside overlapping trigger areas covering the
whole focal surface. In this paper we describe the GAW electronics, as well as
the trigger concept and implementation.
"
What is the correspondence between the QCD Dirac operator and the chiral Random Matrix Theory?,"  The low-lying eigenvalue spectrum of the QCD Dirac operator in the
epsilon-regime is expected to match with that of chiral Random Matrix Theory
(ChRMT). We study this correspondence for the case including sea quarks by
performing two-flavor QCD simulations on the lattice. Using the overlap fermion
formulation, which preserves exact chiral symmetry at finite lattice spacings,
we push the sea quark mass down to \sim 3 MeV on a 16^3\times 32 lattice at a
lattice spacing a \simeq 0.11 fm. We compare the low-lying eigenvalue
distributions and find a good agreement with the analytical predictions of
ChRMT. By matching the lowest-lying eigenvalue we extract the chiral
condensate, \Sigma(2 GeV)[MSbar] = [251(7)(11) MeV]^3, where errors represent
statistical and higher order effects in the epsilon expansion. We also
calculate the eigenvalue distributions on the lattices with heavier sea quarks
at two lattice spacings. Although the epsilon expansion is not applied for
those sea quarks, we find a reasonable agreement of the Dirac operator spectrum
with ChRMT. The value of Sigma, after extrapolating to the chiral limit, is
consistent with the estimate in the epsilon-regime.
"
What is the Koszul algebra of a finitely generated graded left A-module?,"  Let A be a Koszul algebra, and $mod A$ the category of finitely generated
graded left A-modules. The ""linearity defect"" ld_A(M) of $M \in mod A$ is an
invariant defined by Herzog and Iyengar. An exterior algebra E is a Koszul
algebra which is the Koszul dual S^! of a polynomial ring S. Eisenbud et al.
showed that $ld_E(M) < \infty$ for all $M \in mod E$. Improving their result,
we show the following (and many other facts):
  (*) If A is a Koszul complete intersection, then $reg_{A^!} (M) < \infty$ and
$ld_{A^!} (M) < \infty$ for all $M \in mod A^!$.
  (**) There is a uniform bound of $ld(J)$, where J is a graded ideal of E.
"
"How are the two cases of a set family considered, depending on whether the family contains the empty set?","  Current techniques for generating a knowledge space, such as QUERY,
guarantees that the resulting structure is closed under union, but not that it
satisfies wellgradedness, which is one of the defining conditions for a
learning space. We give necessary and sufficient conditions on the base of a
union-closed set family that ensures that the family is well-graded. We
consider two cases, depending on whether or not the family contains the empty
set. We also provide algorithms for efficiently testing these conditions, and
for augmenting a set family in a minimal way to one that satisfies these
conditions.
"
What are the observed quasar-galaxy pairs called close pairs in the SDSS catalog?,"  Based on the SDSS catalog, we have found new close quasar-galaxy pairs.
Quasars projected onto the halos of nearer galaxies are encountered among the
multitude of quasars observed at various distances from us. Among them there
are quasars that are close to the galaxies not only in angular separation, but
also in redshift. Such quasar-galaxy pairs are called close pairs. We developed
further the hypothesis that such pairs appear, because the fluxer on the
nucleus of the more distant galaxy passes through halo globular clusters of the
nearer galaxy,resulting in magnification and splitting of the image of the
source that we interpret as a quasar. To corroborate this hypothesis, we
analyzed the distribution of quasars in the plane of the halos of these
galaxies. The quasars from close pairs were found to follow the density profile
of globular clusters in the halos of elliptical and spiral galaxies with slopes
of -1.5 and -2.4 for elliptical and spiral galaxies, respectively. This
suggests that quasars do not appear near galaxies by chance and that quasars
are associated with galaxies via halo globular clusters.
"
What are the electron-positron production rates in the Standard Model?,"  We present a detailed calculation of the electron-positron production rate
using neutrinos in an intense background magnetic field. The computation is
done for the process nu -> nu e- e+ (where nu can be nu_e, nu_mu, or nu_tau)
within the framework of the Standard Model. Results are given for various
combinations of Landau-levels over a range of possible incoming neutrino
energies and magnetic field strengths.
"
What is the relationship between the quantum-Hall activation gaps in graphene and the Landau levels in the quantum Hall effect?,"  We have measured the quantum-Hall activation gaps in graphene at filling
factors $\nu=2$ and $\nu=6$ for magnetic fields up to 32 T and temperatures
from 4 K to 300 K. The $\nu =6$ gap can be described by thermal excitation to
broadened Landau levels with a width of 400 K. In contrast, the gap measured at
$\nu=2$ is strongly temperature and field dependent and approaches the expected
value for sharp Landau levels for fields $B > 20$ T and temperatures $T > 100$
K. We explain this surprising behavior by a narrowing of the lowest Landau
level.
"
What are the fundamental parameters determined for He-weak and He-strong stars using the Divan-Chalonge-Barbier (BCD) spectrophotometric system?,"  We carried out low resolution spectroscopic observations in the wavelength
range 3400-4700 A of 20 He-weak and 8 He-strong stars to determine their
fundamental parameters by means of the Divan-Chalonge-Barbier (BCD)
spectrophotometric system. For a few He-weak stars we also estimate the
effective temperatures and the angular diameters by integrating absolute fluxes
observed over a wide spectral range. Non-LTE model calculations are carried out
to study the influence of the He/H abundance ratio on the emergent radiation of
He-strong stars and on their Teff determination. We find that the effective
temperatures, surface gravities and bolometric absolute magnitudes of He-weak
stars estimated with the BCD system and the integrated flux method are in good
agreement between each other, and they also agree with previous determinations
based on several different methods. The mean discrepancy between the visual
absolute magnitudes derived using the Hipparcos parallaxes and the BCD values
is on average 0.3 mag for He-weak stars, while it is 0.5 mag for He-strong
stars. For He-strong stars, we note that the BCD calibration, based on stars in
the solar environment, leads to overestimated values of Teff. By means of model
atmosphere calculations with enhanced He/H abundance ratios we show that larger
He/H ratios produce smaller BD which naturally explains the Teff
overestimation. We take advantage of these calculations to introduce a method
to estimate the He/H abundance ratio in He-strong stars. The BD of HD 37479
suggests that the Teff of this star remains fairly constant as the star
spectrum undergoes changes in the intensity of H and He absorption lines. Data
for the He-strong star HD 66765 are reported for the first time.
"
What is the supersymmetry breaking in a warped space model?,"  Supersymmetry breaking together by constant boundary superpotentials and by
the O'Raifeartaigh model is studied in a warped space model. It is shown that
the contribution of constant boundary superpotentials enables the moduli of
chiral supermultiplets to be stabilized and that the vacuum at the stationary
point has zero cosmological constant in a wide region of parameters.
"
What is the numerical method presented for the study of accretion disks around black holes?,"  We present a numerical method for spatially 1.5-dimensional and
time-dependent studies of accretion disks around black holes, that is
originated from a combination of the standard pseudo-spectral method and the
adaptive domain decomposition method existing in the literature, but with a
number of improvements in both the numerical and physical senses. In
particular, we introduce a new treatment for the connection at the interfaces
of decomposed subdomains, construct an adaptive function for the mapping
between the Chebyshev-Gauss-Lobatto collocation points and the physical
collocation points in each subdomain, and modify the over-simplified
1-dimensional basic equations of accretion flows to account for the effects of
viscous stresses in both the azimuthal and radial directions. Our method is
verified by reproducing the best results obtained previously by Szuszkiewicz &
Miller on the limit-cycle behavior of thermally unstable accretion disks with
moderate viscosity. A new finding is that, according to our computations, the
Bernoulli function of the matter in such disks is always and everywhere
negative, so that outflows are unlikely to originate from these disks. We are
encouraged to study the more difficult case of thermally unstable accretion
disks with strong viscosity, and wish to report our results in a subsequent
paper.
"
How do hydrodynamic interactions facilitate unfolding at constant force and inhibit stretching by fluid flows?,"  We incorporate hydrodynamic interactions in a structure-based model of
ubiquitin and demonstrate that the hydrodynamic coupling may reduce the peak
force when stretching the protein at constant speed, especially at larger
speeds. Hydrodynamic interactions are also shown to facilitate unfolding at
constant force and inhibit stretching by fluid flows.
"
What is the progress of the Compact Muon Solenoid at CERN?,"  After a brief overview of the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment, the
status of construction, installation and commissioning is described. Very good
progress has been achieved in the past year. Though many significant challenges
still lie ahead, CMS should be ready for recording data from first collisions
in the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) accelerator complex at CERN
"
What is the structure of weight 2 blocks and [2:1]-pairs of q-Schur algebras?,"  We obtain the structure of weight 2 blocks and [2:1]-pairs of q-Schur
algebras, and compute explicitly the modular Alvis-Curtis duality for weight 2
blocks of finite general linear groups in non-defining characteristic.
"
What are the conditions for the layer potentials to be bounded and invertible on $L^2(\mathbb{R}^n)$ when the coefficient matrix is real and symmetric?,"  We consider divergence form elliptic operators of the form $L=-\dv
A(x)\nabla$, defined in $R^{n+1} = \{(x,t)\in R^n \times R \}$, $n \geq 2$,
where the $L^{\infty}$ coefficient matrix $A$ is $(n+1)\times(n+1)$, uniformly
elliptic, complex and $t$-independent. We show that for such operators,
boundedness and invertibility of the corresponding layer potential operators on
$L^2(\mathbb{R}^{n})=L^2(\partial\mathbb{R}_{+}^{n+1})$, is stable under
complex, $L^{\infty}$ perturbations of the coefficient matrix. Using a variant
of the $Tb$ Theorem, we also prove that the layer potentials are bounded and
invertible on $L^2(\mathbb{R}^n)$ whenever $A(x)$ is real and symmetric (and
thus, by our stability result, also when $A$ is complex, $\Vert
A-A^0\Vert_{\infty}$ is small enough and $A^0$ is real, symmetric, $L^{\infty}$
and elliptic). In particular, we establish solvability of the Dirichlet and
Neumann (and Regularity) problems, with $L^2$ (resp. $\dot{L}^2_1)$ data, for
small complex perturbations of a real symmetric matrix. Previously, $L^2$
solvability results for complex (or even real but non-symmetric) coefficients
were known to hold only for perturbations of constant matrices (and then only
for the Dirichlet problem), or in the special case that the coefficients
$A_{j,n+1}=0=A_{n+1,j}$, $1\leq j\leq n$, which corresponds to the Kato square
root problem.
"
What are the benefits of tightly-coupled multiprocessors in SLIRP for scientific research?,"  We introduce SLIRP, a module generator for the S-Lang numerical scripting
language, with a focus on its vectorization capabilities. We demonstrate how
both SLIRP and S-Lang were easily adapted to exploit the inherent parallelism
of high-level mathematical languages with OpenMP, allowing general users to
employ tightly-coupled multiprocessors in scriptable research calculations
while requiring no special knowledge of parallel programming. Motivated by
examples in the ISIS astrophysical modeling & analysis tool, performance
figures are presented for several machine and compiler configurations,
demonstrating beneficial speedups for real-world operations.
"
What is the concept of conformally equivariant quantizations and how was it introduced?,"  The concept of conformally equivariant quantizations was introduced by Duval,
Lecomte and Ovsienko in \cite{DLO} for manifolds endowed with flat conformal
structures. They obtained results of existence and uniqueness (up to
normalization) of such a quantization procedure. A natural generalization of
this concept is to seek for a quantization procedure, over a manifold $M$, that
depends on a pseudo-Riemannian metric, is natural and is invariant with respect
to a conformal change of the metric. The existence of such a procedure was
conjectured by P. Lecomte in \cite{Leconj} and proved by C. Duval and V.
Ovsienko in \cite{DO1} for symbols of degree at most 2 and by S. Loubon Djounga
in \cite{Loubon} for symbols of degree 3. In two recent papers \cite{MR,MR1},
we investigated the question of existence of projectively equivariant
quantizations using the framework of Cartan connections. Here we will show how
the formalism developed in these works adapts in order to deal with the
conformally equivariant quantization for symbols of degree at most 3. This will
allow us to easily recover the results of \cite{DO1} and \cite{Loubon}. We will
then show how it can be modified in order to prove the existence of conformally
equivariant quantizations for symbols of degree 4.
"
What is the relationship between the flow rate of grains and the diameter of the orifice?,"  The flow rate of grains through large orifices is known to be dependent on
its diameter to a 5/2 power law. This relationship has been checked for big
outlet sizes, whereas an empirical fitting parameter is needed to reproduce the
behavior for small openings.
  In this work, we provide experimental data and numerical simulations covering
a wide span of outlet sizes, both in three and two dimensions. This allows us
to show that the laws that are usually employed are satisfactory only if a
small range of openings is considered. We propose a new law for the mass flow
rate of grains that correctly reproduces the data for all the orifice sizes,
including the behaviors for very large and very small outlet sizes.
"
Where are the degrees of freedom that give rise to black hole entropy located?,"  Considering the entanglement between quantum field degrees of freedom inside
and outside the horizon as a plausible source of black hole entropy, we address
the question: {\it where are the degrees of freedom that give rise to this
entropy located?} When the field is in ground state, the black hole area law is
obeyed and the degrees of freedom near the horizon contribute most to the
entropy. However, for excited state, or a superposition of ground state and
excited state, power-law corrections to the area law are obtained, and more
significant contributions from the degrees of freedom far from the horizon are
shown.
"
What is the computational procedure based on the Finite Element Method used to calculate protein mechanical response?,"  A coarse-grained computational procedure based on the Finite Element Method
is proposed to calculate the normal modes and mechanical response of proteins
and their supramolecular assemblies. Motivated by the elastic network model,
proteins are modeled as homogeneous isotropic elastic solids with volume
defined by their solvent-excluded surface. The discretized Finite Element
representation is obtained using a surface simplification algorithm that
facilitates the generation of models of arbitrary prescribed spatial
resolution. The procedure is applied to compute the normal modes of a mutant of
T4 phage lysozyme and of filamentous actin, as well as the critical Euler
buckling load of the latter when subject to axial compression. Results compare
favorably with all-atom normal mode analysis, the Rotation Translation Blocks
procedure, and experiment. The proposed methodology establishes a computational
framework for the calculation of protein mechanical response that facilitates
the incorporation of specific atomic-level interactions into the model,
including aqueous-electrolyte-mediated electrostatic effects. The procedure is
equally applicable to proteins with known atomic coordinates as it is to
electron density maps of proteins, protein complexes, and supramolecular
assemblies of unknown atomic structure.
"
What are the implications of the observed variability of PKS0537-441 for our understanding of blazar activity?,"  The blazar PKS0537-441 has been observed by Swift between the end of 2004 and
November 2005. The BAT monitored it recurrently for a total of 2.7 Ms, and the
XRT and UVOT pointed it on seven occasions for a total of 67 ks, making it one
of the AGNs best monitored by Swift. The automatic optical and infrared
telescope REM has monitored simultaneously the source at all times. In
January-February 2005 PKS0537-441 has been detected at its brightest in optical
and X-rays: more than a factor of 2 brighter in X-rays and about a factor 60
brighter in the optical than observed in December 2004. The July 2005
observation recorded a fainter X-ray state. The simultaneous optical state,
monitored by both Swift UVOT and REM, is high, and in the VRI bands it is
comparable to what was recorded in early January 2005, before the outburst. In
November 2005, the source subsided both in X-rays and optical to a quiescent
state, having decreased by factors of ~4 and ~60 with respect to the
January-February 2005 outburst, respectively. Our monitoring shows an overall
well correlated optical and X-ray decay. On the shorter time scales (days or
hours), there is no obvious correlation between X-ray and optical variations,
but the former tend to be more pronounced, opposite to what is observed on
monthly time scales. The widely different amplitude of the long term
variability in optical and X-rays is very unusual and makes this observation a
unique case study for blazar activity. The spectral energy distributions are
interpreted in terms of the synchrotron and inverse Compton mechanisms within a
jet where the plasma radiates via internal shocks and the dissipation depends
on the distance of the emitting region from the central engine (abridged).
"
What is the significance of the Peccei-Quinn symmetry in the context of the SU(5) grand unified model?,"  We propose an SU(5) grand unified model with an invisible axion and the
unification of the three coupling constants which is in agreement with the
values, at $M_Z$, of $\alpha$, $\alpha_s$, and $\sin^2\theta_W$. A discrete,
anomalous, $Z_{13}$ symmetry implies that the Peccei-Quinn symmetry is an
automatic symmetry of the classical Lagrangian protecting, at the same time,
the invisible axion against possible semi-classical gravity effects. Although
the unification scale is of the order of the Peccei-Quinn scale the proton is
stabilized by the fact that in this model the standard model fields form the
SU(5) multiplets completed by new exotic fields and, also, because it is
protected by the $Z_{13}$ symmetry.
"
What is the purpose of the Far-InfraRed Interferometer (FIRI) mission?,"  Half of the energy ever emitted by stars and accreting objects comes to us in
the FIR waveband and has yet to be properly explored. We propose a powerful
Far-InfraRed Interferometer mission, FIRI, to carry out high-resolution imaging
spectroscopy in the FIR. This key observational capability is essential to
reveal how gas and dust evolve into stars and planets, how the first luminous
objects in the Universe ignited, how galaxies formed, and when super-massive
black holes grew. FIRI will disentangle the cosmic histories of star formation
and accretion onto black holes and will trace the assembly and evolution of
quiescent galaxies like our Milky Way. Perhaps most importantly, FIRI will
observe all stages of planetary system formation and recognise Earth-like
planets that may harbour life, via its ability to image the dust structures in
planetary systems. It will thus address directly questions fundamental to our
understanding of how the Universe has developed and evolved - the very
questions posed by ESA's Cosmic Vision.
"
What is the Feynman-Kac formula for a Levy and an infinite dimensional Gaussian process?,"  A Feynman-Kac-type formula for a L\'evy and an infinite dimensional Gaussian
random process associated with a quantized radiation field is derived. In
particular, a functional integral representation of $e^{-t\PF}$ generated by
the Pauli-Fierz Hamiltonian with spin $\han$ in non-relativistic quantum
electrodynamics is constructed. When no external potential is applied $\PF$
turns translation invariant and it is decomposed as a direct integral $\PF =
\int_\BR^\oplus \PF(P) dP$. The functional integral representation of
$e^{-t\PF(P)}$ is also given. Although all these Hamiltonians include spin,
nevertheless the kernels obtained for the path measures are scalar rather than
matrix expressions. As an application of the functional integral
representations energy comparison inequalities are derived.
"
What is the Skyrme model used to compute the hadronic decay widths of baryons?,"  In chiral soliton models for baryons the computation of hadronic decay widths
of baryon resonances is a long standing problem. For the three flavor Skyrme
model I present a solution to this problem that satisfies large--$N_C$
consistency conditions. As an application I focus on the hadronic decay of the
$\Theta$ and $\Theta^*$ pentaquarks.

,"  Let $f\in \mathbb{C}[X_1,..., X_n]$ be a homogeneous polynomial and B(f) be
the corresponding Brieskorn module. We describe the torsion of the Brieskorn
module B(f) for n=2 and show that any torsion element has order 1. For n>2, we
find some examples in which the torsion order is strictly greater than 1.

"What are the implications of the precision measurements of the pseudo observables R_b^0, A_b, and A_FB^0,b at LEP and SLC?","  We point out that the precision measurements of the pseudo observables R_b^0,
A_b, and A_FB^0,b performed at LEP and SLC suggest that in models with
minimal-flavor-violation the sign of the Z-penguin amplitude is identical to
the one present in the standard model. We determine the allowed range for the
non-standard contribution to the Inami-Lim function C and show by analyzing
possible scenarios with positive and negative interference of standard model
and new physics contributions, that the derived bound holds in each given case.
Finally, we derive lower and upper limits for the branching ratios of K^+ ->
pi^+ nu nubar, K_L -> pi^0 nu nubar, K_L -> mu^+ mu^-, B -> X_d,s nu nubar, and
B_d,s -> mu^+ mu^- within constrained minimal-flavor-violation making use of
the wealth of available data collected at the Z-pole.
"
What is the Metropolis algorithm used in connection with mean-field spin systems?,"  In this paper we study the Metropolis algorithm in connection with two
mean--field spin systems, the so called mean--field Ising model and the
Blume--Emery--Griffiths model. In both this examples the naive choice of
proposal chain gives rise, for some parameters, to a slowly mixing Metropolis
chain, that is a chain whose spectral gap decreases exponentially fast (in the
dimension $N$ of the problem). Here we show how a slight variant in the
proposal chain can avoid this problem, keeping the mean computational cost
similar to the cost of the usual Metropolis. More precisely we prove that, with
a suitable variant in the proposal, the Metropolis chain has a spectral gap
which decreases polynomially in 1/N. Using some symmetry structure of the
energy, the method rests on allowing appropriate jumps within the energy level
of the starting state.
"
What are the parameters of the universe in the modified gravity model?,"  In this work we study the dynamics of universe in $f(R)=\sqrt{R^2-R_{0}^2}$
modified gravity with Palatini formalism. We use data from recent observations
as Supernova Type Ia (SNIa) Gold sample and Supernova Legacy Survey (SNLS)
data, size of baryonic acoustic peak from Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), the
position of the acoustic peak from the CMB observations and large scale
structure formation (LSS) from the 2dFGRS survey to put constraint on the
parameters of the model. To check the consistency of this action, we compare
the age of old cosmological objects with the age of universe. In the combined
analysis with the all the observations, we find the parameters of model as
$R_0=6.192_{-0.177}^{+0.167}\times H_0^2$ and
$\Omega_m=0.278_{-0.278}^{+0.273}$.
"
What are the conditions under which the theorem holds?,"  We prove an Alexander type theorem for the spectral unit ball $\Omega_n$
showing that there are no non-trivial proper holomorphic mappings in
$\Omega_n$, $n\geq 2$.
"
What are the properties of the arrival time probability density function?,"  We study the arrival time distribution of overdamped particles driven by a
constant force in a piecewise linear random potential which generates the
dichotomous random force. Our approach is based on the path integral
representation of the probability density of the arrival time. We explicitly
calculate the path integral for a special case of dichotomous disorder and use
the corresponding characteristic function to derive prominent properties of the
arrival time probability density. Specifically, we establish the scaling
properties of the central moments, analyze the behavior of the probability
density for short, long, and intermediate distances. In order to quantify the
deviation of the arrival time distribution from a Gaussian shape, we evaluate
the skewness and the kurtosis.
"
What is the solution of the initial value problem for the coupled system of equations of Korteweg - de Vries type?,"  We study that a solution of the initial value problem associated for the
coupled system of equations of Korteweg - de Vries type which appears as a
model to describe the strong interaction of weakly nonlinear long waves, has
analyticity in time and smoothing effect up to real analyticity if the initial
data only has a single point singularity at $x=0.$
"
What are the structural units in Nb22O54 and Nb12O29?,"  The crystal structure of Nb22O54 is reported for the first time, and the
structure of orthorhombic Nb12O29 is reexamined, resolving previous
ambiguities. Single crystal x-ray and electron diffraction were employed. These
compounds were found to crystallize in the space groups P2/m (a = 15.7491(2) A,
b = 3.8236(3) A, c = 17.8521(2) A, beta = 102.029(3)) and Cmcm (a = 3.8320(2)
A, b = 20.7400(9) A, c = 28.8901(13) A) respectively and share a common
structural unit, a 4x3 block of corner sharing NbO6 octahedra. Despite
different constraints imposed by symmetry these blocks are very similar in both
compounds. Within a block, it is found that the niobium atoms are not located
in the centers of the oxygen octahedra, but rather are displaced inward toward
the center of the block forming an apparent antiferroelectric state. Bond
valence sums and bond lengths do not show the presence of charge ordering,
suggesting that all 4d electrons are delocalized in these compounds at the
temperature studied, T = 200 K.
"
"What is the nature of the ""soft excess"" observed in the X-ray spectrum of NGC 4593?","  We present a detailed analysis of XMM-Newton EPIC-pn data for the Seyfert-1
galaxy NGC 4593. We discuss the X-ray spectral properties of this source as
well as its variations with time. The 0.5-10 keV spectrum shows significant
complexity beyond a simple power-law form, with clear evidence existing for a
""soft excess"" as well as absorption by highly ionized plasma (a warm absorber)
within the central engine of this active galactic nucleus. We show that the
soft excess is best described as originating from thermal Comptonization by
plasma that is appreciably cooler than the primary X-ray emitting plasma; we
find that the form of the soft excess cannot be reproduced adequately by
reflection from an ionized accretion disk. The only measurable deviation from
the power-law continuum in the hard spectrum comes from the presence of cold
and ionized fluorescent iron-K emission lines at 6.4 and 6.97 keV,
respectively. While constraints on the ionized iron line are weak, the cold
line is found to be narrow at CCD-resolution with a flux that does not track
the temporal changes in the underlying continuum, implying an origin in the
outer radii of the accretion disk or the putative molecular torus of Seyfert
unification schemes. The X-ray continuum itself varies on all accessible time
scales. We detect a ~230-second time-lag between soft and hard EPIC-pn bands
that, if interpreted as scattering timescales within a Comptonizing disk
corona, can be used to constrain the physical size of the primary X-ray source
to a characteristic length scale of ~2 gravitational radii. Taken together, the
small implied coronal size and the large implied iron line emitting region
indicate a departure from the current picture of a ""typical"" AGN geometry.
"
What is the Regge behavior in Deeply Virtual Compton Scattering?,"  Recently we have shown that exclusive QCD photon-induced reactions at low
Mandelstam-t are best described by Regge exchanges in the entire scaling
region, and not only for low values of Bjorken-x. In this paper we explore this
crucial Regge behavior in Deeply Virtual Compton Scattering from the point of
view of collinear factorization, with the proton tensor written in terms of
Generalized Parton Distributions, and we reproduce this feature. Thus it
appears that in the Bjorken limit, a large class of hard, low-t exclusive
processes are more sensitive to the meson cloud of the proton than to its
fundamental quark structure. These process will then be described most
efficiently by process-dependent Regge Exclusive Amplitudes rather than by
universal Generalized Parton Distributions. We introduce such Regge Exclusive
Amplitudes for Deeply Virtual Compton Scattering.
"
What are the implications of heterogeneity in the grid performance?,"  Grids include heterogeneous resources, which are based on different hardware
and software architectures or components. In correspondence with this diversity
of the infrastructure, the execution time of any single job, as well as the
total grid performance can both be affected substantially, which can be
demonstrated by measurements. Running a simple benchmarking suite can show this
heterogeneity and give us results about the differences over the grid sites.
"
What are the results of the first measurements of the index of air at 780 nm?,"  A new system, consisting of a double channel Fabry Perot etalon and laser
diodes emitting around 780 nm is described and proposed to be used for air
refractive index measurements. The principle of this refractometer is based on
frequency measurements between optical laser sources. It permits
quasi-instantaneous measurement with a resolution better than and uncertainty
in the range. Some preliminary results on the stability of this system and the
measurements of the refractive index of air with this apparatus are presented.
The first measurements of the index of air at 780 nm are, within an
experimental uncertainty of the order of, in agreement with the predicted
values by the so-called revised Edl\'en equations. This result is to the best
of our knowledge the first to extend to the near infra-red the validity of the
revised Edl\'en equation derived for the wavelength range 350- 650 nm.
"
How are the zero modes of the instanton lifted by supersymmetric three-form background fluxes in Type IIB orientifolds?,"  We study the conditions under which D-brane instantons in Type II orientifold
compactifications generate a non-perturbative superpotential. If the instanton
is non-invariant under the orientifold action, it carries four instead of the
two Goldstone fermions required for superpotential contributions. Unless these
are lifted, the instanton can at best generate higher fermionic F-terms of
Beasley-Witten type. We analyse two strategies to lift the additional zero
modes. First we discuss the process of instantonic brane recombination in Type
IIA orientifolds. We show that in some cases charge invariance of the measure
enforces the presence of further zero modes which, unlike the Goldstinos,
cannot be absorbed. In other cases, the instanton exhibits reparameterisation
zero modes after recombination and a superpotential is generated if these are
lifted by suitable closed or open string couplings. In the second part of the
paper we address lifting the extra Goldstinos of D3-brane instantons by
supersymmetric three-form background fluxes in Type IIB orientifolds. This
requires non-trivial gauge flux on the instanton. Only if the part of the
fermionic action linear in the gauge flux survives the orientifold projection
can the extra Goldstinos be lifted.
"
What are the two alternative models used to predict higher cluster abundance?,"  In the standard Lambda CDM cosmological model with a Gaussian primordial
density fluctuation field, the relatively low value of the mass variance
parameter (sigma_8=0.74{+0.05}{-0.06}, obtained from the WMAP 3-year data)
results in a reduced likelihood that the measured level of CMB anisotropy on
the scales of clusters is due to the Sunyaev-Zeldovich (S-Z) effect. To assess
the feasibility of producing higher levels of S-Z power, we explore two
alternative models which predict higher cluster abundance. In the first model
the primordial density field has a chi^2_1 distribution, whereas in the second
an early dark energy component gives rise to the desired higher cluster
abundance. We carry out the necessary detailed calculations of the levels of
S-Z power spectra, cluster number counts, and angular 2-point correlation
function of clusters, and compare (in a self-consistent way) their predicted
redshift distributions. Our results provide a sufficient basis upon which the
viability of the three models may be tested by future high quality
measurements.
"
"What is the typing of lambda-terms in Elementary and Light Affine Logic (EAL, LAL, resp.)?","  Typing of lambda-terms in Elementary and Light Affine Logic (EAL, LAL, resp.)
has been studied for two different reasons: on the one hand the evaluation of
typed terms using LAL (EAL, resp.) proof-nets admits a guaranteed polynomial
(elementary, resp.) bound; on the other hand these terms can also be evaluated
by optimal reduction using the abstract version of Lamping's algorithm. The
first reduction is global while the second one is local and asynchronous. We
prove that for LAL (EAL, resp.) typed terms, Lamping's abstract algorithm also
admits a polynomial (elementary, resp.) bound. We also show its soundness and
completeness (for EAL and LAL with type fixpoints), by using a simple geometry
of interaction model (context semantics).
"
What are the number of integral bases of the corresponding symmetric group algebra?,"  We describe a recursive algorithm that produces an integral basis for the
centre of the Hecke algebra of type A consisting of linear combinations of
monomial symmetric polynomials of Jucys--Murphy elements. We also discuss the
existence of integral bases for the centre of the Hecke algebra that consist
solely of monomial symmetric polynomials of Jucys--Murphy elements. Finally,
for n=3, we show that only one such basis exists for the centre of the Hecke
algebra, by proving that there are exactly four bases for the centre of the
corresponding symmetric group algebra which consist solely of monomial
symmetric polynomials of Jucys--Murphy elements.
"
What is the relationship between quantum mechanics and the many-worlds interpretation?,"  There are fundamental reasons as to why there should exist a reformulation of
quantum mechanics which does not refer to a classical spacetime manifold. It
follows as a consequence that quantum mechanics as we know it is a limiting
case of a more general nonlinear quantum theory, with the nonlinearity becoming
significant at the Planck mass/energy scale. This nonlinearity is responsible
for a dynamically induced collapse of the wave-function, during a quantum
measurement, and it hence falsifies the many-worlds interpretation of quantum
mechanics. We illustrate this conclusion using a mathematical model based on a
generalized Doebner-Goldin equation. The non-Hermitian part of the Hamiltonian
in this norm-preserving, nonlinear, Schrodinger equation dominates during a
quantum measurement, and leads to a breakdown of linear superposition.
"
What is the process of the formation of circumbinary rotating disks around post-asymptotic giant branch (post-AGB) binary stars?,"  We propose that the large, radius of ~1000 AU, circumbinary rotating disks
observed around some post-asymptotic giant branch (post-AGB) binary stars are
formed from slow AGB wind material that is pushed back to the center of the
nebula by wide jets. We perform 2D-axisymmetrical numerical simulations of fast
and wide jets that interact with the previously ejected slow AGB wind. In each
system there are two oppositely launched jets, but we use the symmetry of the
problem and simulate only one jet. A large circularization-flow (vortex) is
formed to the side of the jet which together with the thermal pressure of the
shocked jet material accelerate cold slow-wind gas back to the center from
distances of ~1000-10000 AU. We find for the parameters we use that up to 0.001
Mo is back-flowing to the center. We conjecture that the orbital angular
momentum of the disk material results from the non-axisymmetric structure of
jets launched by an orbiting companion. This conjecture will have to be tested
with 3D numerical codes.
"
What is the relationship between the decay of the current and the quench rate in a superfluid phase?,"  We study the survival of super-currents in a system of impenetrable bosons
subject to a quantum quench from its critical superfluid phase to an insulating
phase. We show that the evolution of the current when the quench follows a
Rosen-Zener profile is exactly solvable. This allows us to analyze a quench of
arbitrary rate, from a sudden destruction of the superfluid to a slow opening
of a gap. The decay and oscillations of the current are analytically derived,
and studied numerically along with the momentum distribution after the quench.
In the case of small supercurrent boosts $\nu$, we find that the current
surviving at long times is proportional to $\nu^3$.
"
What are the explicit formulas for the eigenvectors of the BBS model?,"  The aim of this contribution is to give the explicit formulas for the
eigenvectors of the transfer-matrix of Baxter-Bazhanov-Stroganov (BBS) model
(N-state spin model) with fixed-spin boundary conditions. These formulas are
obtained by a limiting procedure from the formulas for the eigenvectors of
periodic BBS model. The latter formulas were derived in the framework of the
Sklyanin's method of separation of variables. In the case of fixed-spin
boundaries the corresponding T-Q Baxter equations for the functions of
separated variables are solved explicitly. As a particular case we obtain the
eigenvectors of the Hamiltonian of Ising-like Z_N quantum chain model.
"
What is the structure of the spinel related oxide Na4Ir3O8?,"  A spinel related oxide, Na4Ir3O8, was found to have a three dimensional
network of corner shared Ir4+ (t2g^5) triangles. This gives rise to an
antiferromagnetically coupled S = 1/2 spin system formed on a geometrically
frustrated hyperkagome lattice. Magnetization M and magnetic specific heat Cm
data showed the absence of long range magnetic ordering at least down to 2 K.
The large Cm at low temperatures is independent of applied magnetic field up to
12 T, in striking parallel to the behavior seen in triangular and kagome
antiferromagnets reported to have a spin-liquid ground state. These results
strongly suggest that the ground state of Na4Ir3O8 is a three dimensional
manifestation of a spin liquid.
"
What is the relationship between the tau parameter and the depletion potential?,"  It is known that when hard spheres are added to a pure system of hard rods
the stability of the smectic phase may be greatly enhanced, and that this
effect can be rationalised in terms of depletion forces. In the present paper
we first study the effect of orientational order on depletion forces in this
particular binary system, comparing our results with those obtained adopting
the usual approximation of considering the rods parallel and their orientations
frozen. We consider mixtures with rods of different aspect ratios and spheres
of different diameters, and we treat them within Onsager theory. Our results
indicate that depletion effects, and consequently smectic stability, decrease
significantly as a result of orientational disorder in the smectic phase when
compared with corresponding data based on the frozen--orientation
approximation. These results are discussed in terms of the $\tau$ parameter,
which has been proposed as a convenient measure of depletion strength. We
present closed expressions for $\tau$, and show that it is intimately connected
with the depletion potential. We then analyse the effect of particle geometry
by comparing results pertaining to systems of parallel rods of different shapes
(spherocylinders, cylinders and parallelepipeds). We finally provide results
based on the Zwanzig approximation of a Fundamental--Measure
density--functional theory applied to mixtures of parallelepipeds and cubes of
different sizes. In this case, we show that the $\tau$ parameter exhibits a
linear asymptotic behaviour in the limit of large values of the hard--rod
aspect ratio, in conformity with Onsager theory, as well as in the limit of
large values of the ratio of rod breadth to cube side length, $d$, in contrast
to Onsager approximation, which predicts $\tau\sim d^3$.
"
What is the effect of nutrient consumption rate on the morphology of a cell colony?,"  Cell colonies of bacteria, tumour cells and fungi, under nutrient limited
growth conditions, exhibit complex branched growth patterns. In order to
investigate this phenomenon we present a simple hybrid cellular automaton model
of cell colony growth. In the model the growth of the colony is limited by a
nutrient that is consumed by the cells and which inhibits cell division if it
falls below a certain threshold. Using this model we have investigated how the
nutrient consumption rate of the cells affects the growth dynamics of the
colony. We found that for low consumption rates the colony takes on a Eden-like
morphology, while for higher consumption rates the morphology of the colony is
branched with a fractal geometry. These findings are in agreement with previous
results, but the simplicity of the model presented here allows for a linear
stability analysis of the system. By observing that the local growth of the
colony is proportional to the flux of the nutrient we derive an approximate
dispersion relation for the growth of the colony interface. This dispersion
relation shows that the stability of the growth depends on how far the nutrient
penetrates into the colony. For low nutrient consumption rates the penetration
distance is large, which stabilises the growth, while for high consumption
rates the penetration distance is small, which leads to unstable branched
growth. When the penetration distance vanishes the dispersion relation is
reduced to the one describing Laplacian growth without ultra-violet
regularisation. The dispersion relation was verified by measuring how the
average branch width depends on the consumption rate of the cells and shows
good agreement between theory and simulations.
"
What are the implications of the asymptotic limit on the amount of de Sitter space?,"  We show that in any model of non-eternal inflation satisfying the null energy
condition, the area of the de Sitter horizon increases by at least one Planck
unit in each inflationary e-folding. This observation gives an operational
meaning to the finiteness of the entropy S_dS of an inflationary de Sitter
space eventually exiting into an asymptotically flat region: the asymptotic
observer is never able to measure more than e^(S_dS) independent inflationary
modes. This suggests a limitation on the amount of de Sitter space outside the
horizon that can be consistently described at the semiclassical level, fitting
well with other examples of the breakdown of locality in quantum gravity, such
as in black hole evaporation. The bound does not hold in models of inflation
that violate the null energy condition, such as ghost inflation. This
strengthens the case for the thermodynamical interpretation of the bound as
conventional black hole thermodynamics also fails in these models, strongly
suggesting that these theories are incompatible with basic gravitational
principles.
"
What is the representation of minimax estimation in terms of 2-point BVP solutions?,"  In this paper we study observation problem for linear 2-point BVP Dx=Bf
assuming that information about system input f and random noise \eta in system
state observation model y=Hx+\eta$ is incomplete (f and M\eta\eta' are some
arbitrary elements of given sets). A criterion of guaranteed (minimax)
estimation error finiteness is proposed. Representations of minimax estimations
are obtained in terms of 2-point BVP solutions. It is proved that in general
case we can only estimate a projection of system state onto some linear
manifold $F$. In particular, $F=L_2$ if $dim N(D H) = 0$. Also we propose a
procedure which decides if given linear functional belongs to $F$.
"
What are the advantages of using high angular resolution observations for GMCs?,"  One can estimate the characteristic magnetic field strength in GMCs by
comparing submillimeter polarimetric observations of these sources with
simulated polarization maps developed using a range of different values for the
assumed field strength. The point of comparison is the degree of order in the
distribution of polarization position angles. In a recent paper by H. Li and
collaborators, such a comparison was carried out using SPARO observations of
two GMCs, and employing simulations by E. Ostriker and collaborators. Here we
reexamine this same question, using the same data set and the same simulations,
but using an approach that differs in several respects. The most important
difference is that we incorporate new, higher angular resolution observations
for one of the clouds, obtained using the Hertz polarimeter. We conclude that
the agreement between observations and simulations is best when the total
magnetic energy (including both uniform and fluctuating field components) is at
least as large as the turbulent kinetic energy.
"
What is the effective theory of gravity that stems from the quantum trace anomaly?,"  We study the infrared effective theory of gravity that stems from the quantum
trace anomaly. Quantum fluctuations of the metric induce running of the
cosmological constant and the Newton constant at cosmological scales. By
imposing the generalized Bianchi identity we obtain a prediction for the scale
dependence of the dark matter and dark energy densities in terms of the
parameters of the underlying conformal theory. For certain values of the model
parameters the dark energy equation of state and the observed spectral index of
the primordial density fluctuations can be simultaneously reproduced.
"
What is the role of jet-dominance in the relationship between X-ray luminosity and iron line equivalent width?,"  Using Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer Seyfert 1 and 1.2 data spanning 9 years, we
study correlations between X-ray spectral features. The sample consists of 350
time-resolved spectra from 12 Seyfert 1 and 1.2 galaxies. Each spectrum is
fitted to a model with an intrinsic powerlaw X-ray spectrum produced close to
the central black hole that is reprocessed and absorbed by material around the
black hole. To test the robustness of our results, we performed Monte Carlo
simulations of the spectral sample. We find a complex relationship between the
iron line equivalent width (EW) and the underlying power law index (Gamma). The
data reveal a correlation between Gamma and EW which turns over at Gamma <~ 2,
but finds a weak anti-correlation for steeper photon indices. We propose that
this relationship is driven by dilution of a disk spectrum (which includes the
narrow iron line) by a beamed jet component and, hence, could be used as a
diagnostic of jet-dominance. In addition, our sample shows a strong correlation
between the reflection fraction (R) and Gamma, but we find that it is likely
the result of modeling degeneracies. We also see the X-ray Baldwin effect (an
anti-correlation between the 2-10 keV X-ray luminosity and EW) for the sample
as a whole, but not for the individual galaxies and galaxy types.
"
What is the relationship between the velocity of the instability front and the wavelength of the pattern?,"  Liesegang patterns emerge from precipitation processes and may be used to
build bulk structures at submicron lengthscales. Thus they have significant
potential for technological applications provided adequate methods of control
can be devised. Here we describe a simple, physically realizable
pattern-control based on the notion of driven precipitation, meaning that the
phase-separation is governed by a guiding field such as, for example, a
temperature or a pH field. The phase-separation is modeled through a
non-autonomous Cahn-Hilliard equation whose spinodal is determined by the
evolving guiding field. Control over the dynamics of the spinodal gives control
over the velocity of the instability front which separates the stable and
unstable regions of the system. Since the wavelength of the pattern is largely
determined by this velocity, the distance between successive precipitation
bands becomes controllable. We demonstrate the above ideas by numerical studies
of a 1D system with diffusive guiding field. We find that the results can be
accurately described by employing a linear stability analysis (pulled-front
theory) for determining the velocity -- local-wavelength relationship. From the
perspective of the Liesegang theory, our results indicate that the so-called
revert patterns may be naturally generated by diffusive guiding fields.
"
What is the relationship between the charge ordered insulator and the metal-to-insulator transition?,"  The charge ordering transition induced by the nearest-neighbor Coulomb
repulsion, V, in the 1/4-filled extended Hubbard model is investigated using
Cellular Dynamical Mean-Field Theory. We find a transition to a strongly
renormalized charge ordered Fermi liquid at VCO and a metal-to-insulator
transition at VMI>VCO. Short range antiferromagnetism occurs concomitanly with
the CO transition. Approaching the charge ordered insulator the Fermi surface
deforms and the scattering rate of electrons develops momentum dependence on
the Fermi surface.
"
wave modes in a ferromagnet with finite size?,"  In the present article we give geometric generalizations of the estimates
from Chapters 5,6,7 from \cite{krem:gnus}, while extending their sharpness to
new cases.
"
What is the electric field measured in a plasma with high-current pulse?,"  Electric fields in a plasma that conducts a high-current pulse are measured
as a function of time and space. The experiment is performed using a coaxial
configuration, in which a current rising to 160 kA in 100 ns is conducted
through a plasma that prefills the region between two coaxial electrodes. The
electric field is determined using laser spectroscopy and line-shape analysis.
Plasma doping allows for 3D spatially resolved measurements. The measured peak
magnitude and propagation velocity of the electric field is found to match
those of the Hall electric field, inferred from the magnetic-field front
propagation measured previously.
"
"What are photonic molecules in microcavities or ""photonic atoms""?","  Photonic molecules, named by analogy with chemical molecules, are clusters of
closely located electromagnetically interacting microcavities or ""photonic
atoms"". As two or several microcavities are brought close together, their
optical modes interact, and a rich spectrum of photonic molecule supermodes
emerges, which depends both on geometrical and material properties of
individual cavities and on their mutual interactions. Here, we discuss ways of
controllable manipulation of photonic molecule supermodes, which improve or add
new functionalities to microcavity-based optical components. We present several
optimally-tuned photonic molecule designs for lowering thresholds of
semiconductor microlasers, producing directional light emission, enhancing
sensitivity of microcavity-based bio(chemical)sensors, and optimizing
electromagnetic energy transfer around bends of coupled-cavity waveguides.
Photonic molecules composed of identical microcavities as well as of
microcavities with various degrees of size or material detuning are discussed.
Microwave experiments on scaled photonic molecule structures are currently
under way to confirm our theoretical predictions.
"
What are the implications of the rise of the muon charge ratio with increasing energy in the MINOS detector?,"  The 5.4 kton MINOS far detector has been taking charge-separated cosmic ray
muon data since the beginning of August, 2003 at a depth of 2070
meters-water-equivalent in the Soudan Underground Laboratory, Minnesota, USA.
The data with both forward and reversed magnetic field running configurations
were combined to minimize systematic errors in the determination of the
underground muon charge ratio. When averaged, two independent analyses find the
charge ratio underground to be 1.374 +/- 0.004 (stat.) +0.012 -0.010(sys.).
Using the map of the Soudan rock overburden, the muon momenta as measured
underground were projected to the corresponding values at the surface in the
energy range 1-7 TeV. Within this range of energies at the surface, the MINOS
data are consistent with the charge ratio being energy independent at the two
standard deviation level. When the MINOS results are compared with measurements
at lower energies, a clear rise in the charge ratio in the energy range 0.3 --
1.0 TeV is apparent. A qualitative model shows that the rise is consistent with
an increasing contribution of kaon decays to the muon charge ratio.
"
What are the general features of the self-healing process in self-healing materials?,"  We explore the conductance of self-healing materials as a measure of the
material integrity in the regime of the onset of the initial fatigue. Continuum
effective-field modeling and lattice numerical simulations are reported. Our
results illustrate the general features of the self-healing process: The onset
of the material fatigue is delayed, by developing a plateau-like
time-dependence of the material quality. We demonstrate that in this low-damage
regime, the changes in the conductance and similar transport/response
properties of the material can be used as measures of the material quality
degradation.
"
What is the relationship between the AdS dual and the supersymmetric Wilson loops?,"  In this note we study supersymmetric Wilson loops restricted to an S^2
submanifold of four-dimensional space in N=4 super Yang-Mills. We provide
evidence from both perturbation theory and the AdS dual that those loops are
equal to the analogous observables in two-dimensional Yang-Mills on S^2
(excluding non-perturbative contributions). This relates a subsector of N=4 SYM
to a low-dimensional soluble model and also suggests that this subsector of N
=4 SYM is invariant under area preserving diffeomorphisms.
"
What is the adventure of the math-hating boy Robert in the book by Hans Magnus Enzensberger?,"  This is a missing chapter from Hans Magnus Enzensberger's mathematical
adventure The Number Devil (Henry Holt and Company, New York, 1997). In the
book, a math-hating boy named Robert is visited in his dreams by the clever
Number Devil, who teaches him to love all things numerical. However, we all
forget our dreams from time to time. Here is one adventure that Enzensberger
overlooked, where the Number Devil introduces Robert to geometry not-of-Euclid,
great circles, parallel transport, the pendulum of Foucault, and the genius of
Euler.
"
How does the new approach estimate the distance of a group element to a subgroup?,"  We introduce a new approach for cryptanalysis of key agreement protocols
based on noncommutative groups. This approach uses functions that estimate the
distance of a group element to a given subgroup. We test it against the
Shpilrain-Ushakov protocol, which is based on Thompson's group F.
"
What are the achievable rates with the Dirty-Paper coding scheme and the fading Costa's channel?,"  In this paper, we examine the effects of imperfect channel estimation at the
receiver and no channel knowledge at the transmitter on the capacity of the
fading Costa's channel with channel state information non-causally known at the
transmitter. We derive the optimal Dirty-paper coding (DPC) scheme and its
corresponding achievable rates with the assumption of Gaussian inputs. Our
results, for uncorrelated Rayleigh fading, provide intuitive insights on the
impact of the channel estimate and the channel characteristics (e.g. SNR,
fading process, channel training) on the achievable rates. These are useful in
practical scenarios of multiuser wireless communications (e.g. Broadcast
Channels) and information embedding applications (e.g. robust watermarking). We
also studied optimal training design adapted to each application. We provide
numerical results for a single-user fading Costa's channel with
maximum-likehood (ML) channel estimation. These illustrate an interesting
practical trade-off between the amount of training and its impact to the
interference cancellation performance using DPC scheme.
"
What is the relationship between the mid-infrared excess emission of a young stellar association and the age of the stars in the association?,"  Most Vega-like stars have far-infrared excess (60micron or longward in IRAS,
ISO, or Spitzer MIPS bands) and contain cold dust (<~150K) analogous to the
Sun's Kuiper-Belt region. However, dust in a region more akin to our asteroid
belt and thus relevant to the terrestrial planet building process is warm and
produces excess emission in mid-infrared wavelengths. By cross-correlating
Hipparcos dwarfs with the MSX catalog, we found that EF Cha, a member of the
recently identified, ~10 Myr old, ``Cha-Near'' Moving Group, possesses
prominent mid-infrared excess. N-band spectroscopy reveals a strong emission
feature characterized by a mixture of small, warm, amorphous and possibly
crystalline silicate grains. Survival time of warm dust grains around this A9
star is <~ 1E5 yrs, much less than the age of the star. Thus, grains in this
extra-solar terrestrial planetary zone must be of ""second generation"" and not a
remnant of primodial dust and are suggestive of substantial planet formation
activity. Such second generation warm excess occurs around ~ 13% of the
early-type stars in nearby young stellar associations.
"
How is a rational function expressed in the form of a finite polynomial?,"  We have general frameworks to obtain Poincare polynomials for Finite and also
Affine types of Kac-Moody Lie algebras. Very little is known however beyond
Affine ones, though we have a constructive theorem which can be applied both
for finite and infinite cases. One can conclusively said that theorem gives the
Poincare polynomial P(G) of a Kac-Moody Lie algebra G in the product form
P(G)=P(g) R where g is a precisely chosen sub-algebra of G and R is a rational
function. Not in the way which theorem says but, at least for 48 hyperbolic Lie
algebras considered in this work, we have shown that there is another way of
choosing a sub-algebra in such a way that R appears to be the inverse of a
finite polynomial. It is clear that a rational function or its inverse can not
be expressed in the form of a finite polynomial. Our method is based on
numerical calculations and results are given for each and every one of 48
Hyperbolic Lie algebras. In an illustrative example however, we will give how
above-mentioned theorem gives us rational functions in which case we find a
finite polynomial for which theorem fails to obtain.
"
What is the improvement in the efficiency of the computations?,"  In this paper the modification of the method conventionally used for the
modeling of the massive fermions production and decays is proposed. The step by
step algorithm is presented. Under the strict conditions the proposed method of
modeling allow distinctly raise the efficiency of the computations.
"
Can the scaling law derived for solar flares be extrapolated to the most intense stellar flaring events?,"  In this work we study the correlation between the soft (1.6--12.4 keV, mostly
thermal) and the hard (20--40 and 60--80 keV, mostly non-thermal) X-ray
emission in solar flares up to the most energetic events, spanning about 4
orders of magnitude in peak flux, establishing a general scaling law and
extending it to the most intense stellar flaring events observed to date. We
used the data from the Reuven Ramaty High-Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager
(RHESSI) spacecraft, a NASA Small Explorer launched in February 2002. RHESSI
has good spectral resolution (~1 keV in the X-ray range) and broad energy
coverage (3 keV--20 MeV), which makes it well suited to distinguish the thermal
from non-thermal emission in solar flares. Our study is based on the detailed
analysis of 45 flares ranging from the GOES C-class, to the strongest X-class
events, using the peak photon fluxes in the GOES 1.6--12.4 keV and in two bands
selected from RHESSI data, i.e.20--40 keV and 60--80 keV. We find a significant
correlation between the soft and hard peak X-ray fluxes spanning the complete
sample studied. The resulting scaling law has been extrapolated to the case of
the most intense stellar flares observed, comparing it with the stellar
observations. Our results show that an extrapolation of the scaling law derived
for solar flares to the most active stellar events is compatible with the
available observations of intense stellar flares in hard X-rays.
"
What is the effect of Na doping on the electronic structure of WO3 with a focus on the role of the impurity potential?,"  We have performed {\it ab-initio} electronic structure calculations to
determine the evolution of the electronic structure of WO$_3$ with Na doping.
Na doping introduces an additional electron when introduced into WO$_3$. The
ensuing electronic structure of Na doped WO$_3$, we find, is very similar to
the electronic structure of an electron introduced into WO$_3$, thus clarifying
the role of the impurity potential due to Na. While the electronic structure of
NaWO$_3$ allows a rigid band like description over a certain energy range,
modifications introduced in the electronic structure can be related back to the
electron due to Na and not the impurity potential that one generally believes
to be responsible.
"
What is the accuracy of the registration and punctures in the system?,"  OBJECTIVES: The aim of this paper is to introduce the principles of
computer-assisted access to the kidney. The system provides the surgeon with a
pre-operative 3D planning on computed tomography (CT) images. After a rigid
registration with space-localized ultrasound (US) data, preoperative planning
can be transferred to the intra-operative conditions and an intuitive
man-machine interface allows the user to perform a puncture. MATERIAL AND
METHODS: Both CT and US images of informed normal volunteer were obtained to
perform calculation on the accuracy of registration and punctures were carried
out on a kidney phantom to measure the precision of the whole of the system.
RESULTS: We carried out millimetric registrations on real data and guidance
experiments on a kidney phantom showed encouraging results of 4.7 mm between
planned and reached targets. We noticed that the most significant error was
related to the needle deflection during the puncture. CONCLUSION: Preliminary
results are encouraging. Further work will be undertaken to improve efficiency
and accuracy, and to take breathing into account.
"
What is the phase transition from gas to solid in a two-dimensional Bose system?,"  The ground-state phase properties of a two-dimensional Bose system with
dipole-dipole interactions is studied by means of quantum Monte Carlo
techniques. Limitations of mean-field theory in a two-dimensional geometry are
discussed. A quantum phase transition from gas to solid is found. Crystal is
tested for existence of a supersolid in the vicinity of the phase transition.
Existence of mesoscopic analogue of the off-diagonal long-range order is shown
in the one-body density matrix in a finite-size crystal. Non-zero superfluid
fraction is found in a finite-size crystal, the signal being dramatically
increased in presence of vacancies.
"
"What is the analogy between the ""water bell"" experiment and the quark-gluon plasma?","  We perform the analog to the ""water bell"" experiment using non-cohesive
granular material. When a jet of granular material, many particles wide,
rebounds from a fixed cylindrical target, it deforms into a sharply-defined
sheet or cone with a shape that mimics a liquid with zero surface tension. The
particulate nature of granular material becomes apparent when the number of
particles in the cross-section of the jet is decreased and the emerging sheets
and cones broaden and gradually disintegrate into a broad spray. This
experiment has its counterpart in the behavior of the quark-gluon plasma
generated by collisions of gold ions at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider.
There a high density of inter-particle collisions gives rise to collective
behavior that has also been described as a liquid.
"
What is the relationship between the atoms scattered in forward and backward directions?,"  We investigate the atom pair production by superradiant backward-scattering
from a Bose-Einstein condensate. By driving the superradiant process with two
frequencies we can extend both the range of pulse duration and intensity by two
orders of magnitude and obtain full control over the number of scattered atoms
in forward and backward direction. We show that the atoms scattered in forward
direction are strongly correlated with the atoms scattered in backward
direction, which makes resonant superradiant backward-scattering a promising
candidate for many-particle entanglement.
"
What are the statistical properties of the height fluctuation of a etched surface?,"  The effect of etching time scale of glass surface on its statistical
properties has been studied using atomic force microscopy technique. We have
characterized the complexity of the height fluctuation of a etched surface by
the stochastic parameters such as intermittency exponents, roughness, roughness
exponents, drift and diffusion coefficients and find their variations in terms
of the etching time.
"
What is the role of the Ljusternik-Schnirelmann category in the study of the topology of Riemannian manifolds?,"  The relation between the number of solutions of a nonlinear equation on a
Riemannian manifold and the topology of the manifold itself is studied. The
technique is based on Ljusternik-Schnirelmann category and Morse theory.
"
What are the implications of the uncertainties in helium burning rates for supernovae nucleosynthesis?,"  We explore the dependence of pre-supernova evolution and supernova
nucleosynthesis yields on the uncertainties in helium burning reaction rates.
Using the revised solar abundances of Lodders (2003) for the initial stellar
composition, instead of those of Anders & Grevesse (1989), changes the
supernova yields and limits the constraints that those yields place on the
12C(a,g)16O reaction rate. The production factors of medium-weight elements (A
= 16-40) were found to be in reasonable agreement with observed solar ratios
within the current experimental uncertainties in the triple alpha reaction
rate. Simultaneous variations by the same amount in both reaction rates or in
either of them separately, however, can induce significant changes in the
central 12C abundance at core carbon ignition and in the mass of the supernova
remnant. It therefore remains important to have experimental determinations of
the helium burning rates so that their ratio and absolute values are known with
an accuracy of 10% or better.
"
What is the recursive functions of Moore that were introduced?,"  Moore introduced a class of real-valued ""recursive"" functions by analogy with
Kleene's formulation of the standard recursive functions. While his concise
definition inspired a new line of research on analog computation, it contains
some technical inaccuracies. Focusing on his ""primitive recursive"" functions,
we pin down what is problematic and discuss possible attempts to remove the
ambiguity regarding the behavior of the differential recursion operator on
partial functions. It turns out that in any case the purported relation to
differentially algebraic functions, and hence to Shannon's model of analog
computation, fails.
"
"What is the condition for existence of the generalized solution of the equation D x = (f, f0)?","  In this paper we introduce linear mapping D from WnF\subset Ln into Lm\times
Rm, induced by linear differential equation d/dt
Fx(t)-C(t)x(t)=f(t),Fx(t_0)=f_0. We prove that D is closed dense defined
mapping for any m\times n-matrix F. Also adjoint mapping D* is constructed and
its domain WmF is described. Some kind of so-called ""integration by parts""
formula for vectors from WnF, WmF is suggested. We obtain a necessary and
sufficient condition for existence of generalized solution of equation
Dx=(f,f_0). Also we find a sufficient criterion for closureness of the R(D) in
Lm\times Rm which is formulated in terms of transparent conditions for blocks
of matrix C(t). Some examples are supplied to illustrate obtained results.
"
"What are the differences between the L^{(1,\infty)}-Hofer norm and the L^\infty-Hofer norm?","  The group Hameo (M,\omega) of Hamiltonian homeomorphisms of a connected
symplectic manifold (M,\omega) was defined and studied in [7] and further in
[6]. In these papers, the authors consistently used the L^{(1,\infty)}-Hofer
norm (and not the L^\infty-Hofer norm) on the space of Hamiltonian paths (see
below for the definitions). A justification for this choice was given in [7].
In this article we study the L^\infty-case. In view of the fact that the Hofer
norm on the group Ham (M,\omega) of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms does not depend
on the choice of the L^{(1,\infty)}-norm vs. the L^\infty-norm [9], Y.-G. Oh
and D. McDuff (private communications) asked whether the two notions of
Hamiltonian homeomorphisms arising from the different norms coincide. We will
give an affirmative answer to this question in this paper.
"
What are the implications of displacement convexity for multi-component systems?,"  We show that certain free energy functionals that are not convex with respect
to the usual convex structure on their domain of definition, are strictly
convex in the sense of displacement convexity under a natural change of
variables. We use this to show that in certain cases, the only critical points
of these functionals are minimizers. This approach based on displacement
convexity permits us to treat multicomponent systems as well as single
component systems. The developments produce new examples of displacement convex
functionals, and, in the multi-component setting, jointly displacement convex
functionals.
"
What are the implications of the migration of the planets on the dynamics of the solar system?,"  We study the dynamics of Jupiter Trojans in the early phase of the Solar
system while the outer planets migrated due to their interaction with the
planetesimal disk.
"
What are the dimensions of the effective quantum field in the (3+1)--dimensional global monopole background?,"  Hawking flux from the Schwarzschild black hole with a global monopole is
obtained by using Robinson and Wilczek's method. Adopting a dimension reduction
technique, the effective quantum field in the (3+1)--dimensional global
monopole background can be described by an infinite collection of the
(1+1)--dimensional massless fields if neglecting the ingoing modes near the
horizon, where the gravitational anomaly can be cancelled by the
(1+1)--dimensional black body radiation at the Hawking temperature.
"
What is the application of the results of this research to the giant magnon in string theory?,"  Solitons in field theory provide a window into regimes not directly
accessible by the fundamental perturbative degrees of freedom. Motivated by
interest in the worldsheet S-matrix of string theory in AdS_5 x S^5 in the
limit of infinite worldsheet volume we consider the semiclassical quantization
of a particular soliton of this theory: the Hofman-Maldacena `giant magnon'
spinning string. We obtain explicit formulas for the complete spectrum of
bosonic and fermionic fluctuations around the giant magnon. As an application
of these results we confirm that the one-loop correction to the classical
energy vanishes as expected.
"
What is the relationship between the inflaton and phantom fields?,"  We present a model where early inflation and late accelerating expansion of
the Universe are driven by the real and imaginary parts of a single complex
scalar field, which we identified as inflaton and phantom field, respectively.
This inflaton-phantom unification is protected by an internal SO(1,1) symmetry,
with the two cosmological scalars appearing as the degrees of freedom of a sole
fundamental representation. The unification symmetry allows to build successful
potentials. We observe that our theory provides a matter-phantom duality, which
transforms scalar matter cosmological solutions into phantom solutions and vice
versa. We also suggest that a complete unification of all scalar fields of
cosmological interest is yet possible under a similar footing.
"
What are the advantages of using the ray model for the analysis of light emission from a stadium-shaped semiconductor microcavity laser?,"  We study light emission patterns from stadium-shaped semiconductor (GaAs)
microcavity lasers theoretically and experimentally. Performing systematic wave
calculations for passive cavity modes, we demonstrate that the averaging by
low-loss modes, such as those realized in multi-mode lasing, generates an
emission pattern in good agreement with the ray model's prediction. In
addition, we show that the dependence of experimental far-field emission
patterns on the aspect ratio of the stadium cavity is well reproduced by the
ray model.
"
What is the relationship between the Zassenhaus conjecture and the Kimmerle's conjecture?,"  We consider the Zassenhaus conjecture for the normalized unit group of the
integral group ring of the McLaughlin sporadic group McL. As a consequence, we
confirm for this group the Kimmerle's conjecture on prime graphs.
"
What are the properties of the abelian ideals of a tree diagram Lie algebra?,"  A tree diagram is a tree with positive integral weight on each edge, which is
a notion generalized from the Dynkin diagrams of finite-dimensional simple Lie
algebras. We introduce two nilpotent Lie algebras and their extended solvable
Lie algebras associated with each tree diagram. The solvable tree diagram Lie
algebras turn out to be complete Lie algebras of maximal rank analogous to the
Borel subalgebras of finite-dimensional simple Lie algebras. Their abelian
ideals are completely determined. Using a high-order Campbell-Hausdorff formula
and certain abelian ideals of the tree diagram Lie algebras, we solve the
initial value problem of first-order evolution partial differential equations
associated with nilpotent tree diagram Lie algebras and high-order evolution
partial differential equations, including heat conduction type equations
related to generalized Tricomi operators associated with trees.
"
How can the local properties of N-partite unitary transformations be measured and communicated?,"  We show that in principle, $N$-partite unitary transformations can be
perfectly discriminated under local measurement and classical communication
(LOCC) despite of their nonlocal properties. Based on this result, some related
topics, including the construction of the appropriate quantum circuit together
with the extension to general completely positive trace preserving operations,
are discussed.
"
What is the distribution of the eigenvalues of a symmetric random matrix with equidistributed entries when its law has a finite second moment?,"  Let $X_N$ be an $N\ts N$ random symmetric matrix with independent
equidistributed entries. If the law $P$ of the entries has a finite second
moment, it was shown by Wigner \cite{wigner} that the empirical distribution of
the eigenvalues of $X_N$, once renormalized by $\sqrt{N}$, converges almost
surely and in expectation to the so-called semicircular distribution as $N$
goes to infinity. In this paper we study the same question when $P$ is in the
domain of attraction of an $\alpha$-stable law. We prove that if we renormalize
the eigenvalues by a constant $a_N$ of order $N^{\frac{1}{\alpha}}$, the
corresponding spectral distribution converges in expectation towards a law
$\mu_\alpha$ which only depends on $\alpha$. We characterize $\mu_\alpha$ and
study some of its properties; it is a heavy-tailed probability measure which is
absolutely continuous with respect to Lebesgue measure except possibly on a
compact set of capacity zero.
"
What are the consequences of the widely accepted results of special relativistic thermodynamics?,"  The mathematical properties associated with the widely accepted concept of
the extensivity of many of the common thermodynamic variables are examined and
some of their consequences considered. The possible conflict between some of
these and currently accepted results of special relativistic thermodynamics is
highlighted. Although several questions are raised, answers are not advanced as
this seems an area demanding calm, widespread reflection which could
conceivably lead to radical revision of part, or parts, of theoretical physics.
"
What are the momentum and correlation characteristics of $\alpha$ particles for the $^{14}$N$\to3\alpha+X$ channel in the laboratory system?,"  Recent studies of clustering in light nuclei with an initial energy above 1 A
GeV in nuclear treack emulsion are overviewed. The results of investigations of
the relativistic $^9$Be nuclei fragmentation in emulsion, which entails the
production of He fragments, are presented. It is shown that most precise
angular measurements provided by this technique play a crucial role in the
restoration of the excitation spectrum of the $\alpha$ particle sysytem. In
peripheral interactions $^9$Be nuclei are dissociated practically totally
through the 0$^+$ and 2$^+$ states of the $^8$Be nucleus.
  The results of investigations of the dissociation of a $^{14}$N nucleus of
momentum 2.86 A GeV/c in emulsion are presented as example of more complicated
system. The momentum and correlation characteristics of $\alpha$ particles for
the $^{14}$N$\to3\alpha+X$ channel in the laboratory system and the rest
systems of 3$\alpha$ particles were considered in detail.
  Topology of charged fragments produced in peripheral relativistic
dissociation of radioactive $^8$B, $^7$Be nuclei in emulsion is studied.
"
What is the relationship between a strongly homotopy commutative algebra and a symplectic algebra?,"  In this paper we show that a strongly homotopy commutative (or $C_\infty$-)
algebra with an invariant inner product on its cohomology can be uniquely
extended to a symplectic $C_\infty$-algebra (an $\infty$-generalisation of a
commutative Frobenius algebra introduced by Kontsevich). This result relies on
the algebraic Hodge decomposition of the cyclic Hochschild cohomology of a
$\ci$-algebra and does not generalize to algebras over other operads.
"
What parameters are required to achieve a correct final result for the overall quantum computation?,"  In this paper we extend both standard fault tolerance theory and Kitaev's
model for quantum computation, combining them so as to yield quantitative
results that reveal the interplay between the two. Our analysis establishes a
methodology that allows us to quantitatively determine design parameters for a
quantum computer, the values of which ensure that an overall computation of
interest yields a correct *final result* with some prescribed probability of
success, as opposed to merely ensuring that the desired *final quantum state*
is obtained. As a specific example of the practical application of our
approach, we explicitly calculate the number of levels of error correction
concatenation needed to achieve a correct final result for the overall
computation with some prescribed success probability. Since our methodology
allows one to determine parameters required in order to achieve the correct
final result for the overall quantum computation, as opposed to merely ensuring
that the desired final quantum state is produced, our method enables the
determination of complete quantum computational resource requirements
associated to the actual solution of practical problems.
"
What are the indications and limitations of the programs in the field of HIV infection?,"  Longitudinal studies could be complicated by left-censored repeated measures.
For example, in Human Immunodeficiency Virus infection, there is a detection
limit of the assay used to quantify the plasma viral load. Simple imputation of
the limit of the detection or of half of this limit for left-censored measures
biases estimations and their standard errors. In this paper, we review two
likelihood-based methods proposed to handle left-censoring of the outcome in
linear mixed model. We show how to fit these models using SAS Proc NLMIXED and
we compare this tool with other programs. Indications and limitations of the
programs are discussed and an example in the field of HIV infection is shown.
"
What is the correlation between the peak energy and the total isotropic energy of Gamma Ray Bursts?,"  We study 7 Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs), detected both by the BATSE instrument,
on-board the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory, and by the Wide Field Camera (WFC),
on-board BeppoSAX. These bursts have measured spectroscopic redshifts and are a
sizeable fraction of the bursts defining the correlation between the peak
energy E_peak (i.e. the peak of the vFv spectrum) and the total prompt
isotropic energy E_iso (the so called ""Amati"" relation). Recent theoretical
interpretations of this correlation assume that black-body emission dominates
the time resolved spectra of GRBs, even if, in the time integrated spectrum,
its presence may be hidden by the change of its temperature and by the dilution
of a possible non-thermal power law component. We perform a time resolved
spectral analysis, and show that the sum of a power-law and a black-body gives
acceptable fits to the time dependent spectra within the BATSE energy range,
but overpredicts the flux in the WFC X-ray range. Moreover, a fit with a cutoff
power-law plus a black-body is consistent with the WFC data, but the black-body
component contributes a negligible fraction of the total flux. On the contrary,
we find that fitting the spectra with a Band model or a simple cutoff power-law
model yields an X-ray flux and spectral slope which well matches the WFC
spectra.
"
hamiltonian.,"  The goal of this paper is to provide estimates leading to a direct proof of
the exponential decay of the n-point correlation functions for certain
unbounded models of Kac type. The methods are based on estimating higher order
derivatives of the solution of the Witten Laplacian equation on one forms
associated with the hamiltonian of the system. We also provide a formula for
the Taylor coefficients of the pressure that is suitable for a direct proof the
analyticity.
"
What are the noise properties of the sensor in flip-chip configuration in unshielded environments?,"  In applications for high-Tc superconducting DC-SQUIDs such as biomagnetism,
nondestructive evaluation and the relaxation of magnetic nanoparticles, it is
important to maintain reliable sensor performance over an extended time period.
We designed and produced DC-SQUID gradiometers based on YBCO thin films which
are inductively coupled to a flux transformer to achieve a higher sensitivity.
The gradiometers are protected against ambient atmosphere and humidity by SiO2
and amorphous YBCO layers.
  The noise properties of the sensor in flip-chip configuration, especially in
unshielded environments, are shown. We present a comparison of TBCCO thin films
on buffered sapphire or LaAlO3 substrates for the flux transformer in shielded
and unshielded environments. We reach a low white field gradient noise of 72
fT/(cm sqrt(Hz)) with the TBCCO on LaAlO3 flux transformer. The electric
properties of the gradiometers (critical current IC, normal state resistance RN
and the transfer function VPhi) were measured over a period of one year and do
not show significant signs of degradation.
"
What are the charge radii of the E++ baryons determined in the relativistic quark model at small and intermediate momentum transfer?,"  The electromagnetic form factors of the exotic baryons are calculated in the
framework of the relativistic quark model at small and intermediate momentum
transfer. The charge radii of the E+++ baryons are determined.
"
What is the criterion for the existence of global cross sections to Anosov flows?,"  We prove an inequality for H\""older continuous differential forms on compact
manifolds in which the integral of the form over the boundary of a sufficiently
small, smoothly immersed disk is bounded by a certain multiplicative convex
combination of the volume of the disk and the area of its boundary. This
inequality has natural applications in dynamical systems, where H\""older
continuity is ubiquitous. We give two such applications. In the first one, we
prove a criterion for the existence of global cross sections to Anosov flows in
terms of their expansion-contraction rates. The second application provides an
analogous criterion for non-accessibility of partially hyperbolic
diffeomorphisms.
"
"What are the morphologies observed in the adsorbate layer, depending on the relative strength of the interactions of adsorbate atoms with each other and with the substrate atoms?","  We study the three-dimensional structure formation when atoms are deposited
onto a substrate with a decagonal quasicrystalline order.
Molecular-dynamicscalculations show that the adsorbate layer consists of
ordered nano-scale domains with orientations determined by the underlying
substrate symmetry. Depending on the relative strength of the interactions of
adsorbate atoms with each other and with the substrate atoms, different
morphologies are observed ranging from layer-by-layer growth to cluster
formation. We also find that the film thickness likewise affects the overall
structure of the growing film: Depending on the relative strength of the
interaction between adsorbate atoms, a structural transition of the
configuration of the adsorbate layers closest to the substrate can occur as the
number of deposited layers increases.
"
What are the properties of the Lyapunov stable and limsup of the sequence of the indices of planar homeomorphisms?,"  Given any positive sequence (\{c_n\}_{n \in {\Bbb N}}), we construct
orientation preserving homeomorphisms (f:{\Bbb R}^3 \to {\Bbb R}^3) such that
(Fix(f)=Per(f)=\{0\}), (0) is Lyapunov stable and (\limsup \frac{|i(f^m,
0)|}{c_m}= \infty). We will use our results to discuss and to point out some
strong differences with respect to the computation and behavior of the
sequences of the indices of planar homeomorphisms.
"
What are the conditions for the electromagnetic forces and torques in the case of non-spherical objects?,"  Optical tweezers and optical lattices are making it possible to control small
particles by means of electromagnetic forces and torques. In this context, a
method is presented in this work to calculate electromagnetic forces and
torques for arbitrarily-shaped objects in the presence of other objects
illuminated by a plane wave. The method is based upon an expansion of the
electromagnetic field in terms of multipoles around each object, which are in
turn used to derive forces and torques analytically. The calculation of
multipole coefficients are obtained numerically by means of the boundary
element method. Results are presented for both spherical and non-spherical
objects.
"
What are the conditions under which the maximum in the resistance R(T) turns out to be sensitive to weak magnetic fields?,"  We suggest to use `fluctuation spectroscopy' as a method to detect
granularity in a disordered metal close to a superconducting transition. We
show that with lowering temperature $T$ the resistance $R(T)$ of a system of
relatively large grains initially grows due to the fluctuation suppression of
the one-electron tunneling but decreases with further lowering $T$ due to the
coherent charge transfer of the fluctuation Cooper pairs. Under certain
conditions, such a maximum in $R(T)$ turns out to be sensitive to weak magnetic
fields due to a novel Maki -- Thompson type mechanism.
"
How is the Kalman filter distributed across a network of sensors to estimate a large-scale dynamical system?,"  This paper derives a \emph{distributed} Kalman filter to estimate a sparsely
connected, large-scale, $n-$dimensional, dynamical system monitored by a
network of $N$ sensors. Local Kalman filters are implemented on the
($n_l-$dimensional, where $n_l\ll n$) sub-systems that are obtained after
spatially decomposing the large-scale system. The resulting sub-systems
overlap, which along with an assimilation procedure on the local Kalman
filters, preserve an $L$th order Gauss-Markovian structure of the centralized
error processes. The information loss due to the $L$th order Gauss-Markovian
approximation is controllable as it can be characterized by a divergence that
decreases as $L\uparrow$. The order of the approximation, $L$, leads to a lower
bound on the dimension of the sub-systems, hence, providing a criterion for
sub-system selection. The assimilation procedure is carried out on the local
error covariances with a distributed iterate collapse inversion (DICI)
algorithm that we introduce. The DICI algorithm computes the (approximated)
centralized Riccati and Lyapunov equations iteratively with only local
communication and low-order computation. We fuse the observations that are
common among the local Kalman filters using bipartite fusion graphs and
consensus averaging algorithms. The proposed algorithm achieves full
distribution of the Kalman filter that is coherent with the centralized Kalman
filter with an $L$th order Gaussian-Markovian structure on the centralized
error processes. Nowhere storage, communication, or computation of
$n-$dimensional vectors and matrices is needed; only $n_l \ll n$ dimensional
vectors and matrices are communicated or used in the computation at the
sensors.
"
What are the relationships among the scale factors implied by U dualities?,"  We consider N -- charge, intersecting brane antibrane configurations in M
theory which are smeared uniformly in the common transverse space and may
describe our universe. We study the consequences of U dualities and find that
they imply relations among the scale factors. We find using Einstein's
equations that U dualities also imply a relation among the density \rho and the
pressure p_i for the single charge case. We present an ansatz for \rho and p_i
for the N -- charge case which yields all the U duality relations among the
scale factors. We then study configurations with identical charges, and also
with net charges vanishing. We find among other things that, independent of the
details of the brane antibrane dynamics, such four charge configurations lead

What are the difficulties in reproducing the Pioneer anomaly with MOND-like models?,"  Modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND) is a possible way to explain the flat
galaxy rotation curves without invoking the existence of dark matter. It is
however quite difficult to predict such a phenomenology in a consistent field
theory, free of instabilities and admitting a well-posed Cauchy problem. We
examine critically various proposals of the literature, and underline their
successes and failures both from the experimental and the field-theoretical
viewpoints. We exhibit new difficulties in both cases, and point out the hidden
fine tuning of some models. On the other hand, we show that several published
no-go theorems are based on hypotheses which may be unnecessary, so that the
space of possible models is a priori larger. We examine a new route to
reproduce the MOND physics, in which the field equations are particularly
simple outside matter. However, the analysis of the field equations within
matter (a crucial point which is often forgotten in the literature) exhibits a
deadly problem, namely that they do not remain always hyperbolic. Incidentally,
we prove that the same theoretical framework provides a stable and well-posed
model able to reproduce the Pioneer anomaly without spoiling any of the
precision tests of general relativity. Our conclusion is that all MOND-like
models proposed in the literature, including the new ones examined in this
paper, present serious difficulties: Not only they are unnaturally fine tuned,
but they also fail to reproduce some experimental facts or are unstable or
inconsistent as field theories. However, some frameworks, notably the
tensor-vector-scalar (TeVeS) one of Bekenstein and Sanders, seem more promising
than others, and our discussion underlines in which directions one should try
to improve them.
"
What are the implications of the non-compact composition operators in the connected component of the compact ones on the Hardy space H2?,"  We show that there exist non-compact composition operators in the connected
component of the compact ones on the classical Hardy space $H^2$ on the unit
disc. This answers a question posed by Shapiro and Sundberg in 1990. We also
establish an improved version of a theorem of MacCluer, giving a lower bound
for the essential norm of a difference of composition operators in terms of the
angular derivatives of their symbols. As a main tool we use Aleksandrov-Clark
measures.
"
What is the Bauer-Furuta invariant for a 4-manifold with a Z/2-action on K3#K3?,"  S.Bauer and M.Furuta defined a stable cohomotopy refinement of the
Seiberg-Witten invariants. In this paper, we prove a vanishing theorem of
Bauer-Furuta invariants for 4-manifolds with smooth Z/2-actions. As an
application, we give a constraint on smooth Z/2-actions on homotopy K3#K3, and
construct a nonsmoothable locally linear Z/2-action on K3#K3. We also construct
a nonsmoothable locally linear Z/2-action on $K3$.
"
What is the current theoretical framework for the formation of the first stars?,"  A mechanism is identified whereby dark matter (DM) in protostellar halos
dramatically alters the current theoretical framework for the formation of the
first stars. Heat from neutralino DM annihilation is shown to overwhelm any
cooling mechanism, consequently impeding the star formation process and
possibly leading to a new stellar phase. A ""dark star'' may result: a giant
($\gtrsim 1$ AU) hydrogen-helium star powered by DM annihilation instead of
nuclear fusion. Observational consequences are discussed.
"
What is the maximum order of a graph in the set of graphs with metric dimension β and diameter D?,"  A set of vertices $S$ \emph{resolves} a connected graph $G$ if every vertex
is uniquely determined by its vector of distances to the vertices in $S$. The
\emph{metric dimension} of $G$ is the minimum cardinality of a resolving set of
$G$. Let $\mathcal{G}_{\beta,D}$ be the set of graphs with metric dimension
$\beta$ and diameter $D$. It is well-known that the minimum order of a graph in
$\mathcal{G}_{\beta,D}$ is exactly $\beta+D$. The first contribution of this
paper is to characterise the graphs in $\mathcal{G}_{\beta,D}$ with order
$\beta+D$ for all values of $\beta$ and $D$. Such a characterisation was
previously only known for $D\leq2$ or $\beta\leq1$. The second contribution is
to determine the maximum order of a graph in $\mathcal{G}_{\beta,D}$ for all
values of $D$ and $\beta$. Only a weak upper bound was previously known.
"
What is the Tomonaga-Schwinger equation used to define the quantum states of the brane-world geometry?,"  The Arnowitt-Deser-Misner canonical formulation of general relativity is
extended to the covariant brane-world theory in arbitrary dimensions. The
exclusive probing of the extra dimensions makes a substantial difference,
allowing for the construction of a non-constrained canonical theory. The
quantum states of the brane-world geometry are defined by the
Tomonaga-Schwinger equation, whose integrability conditions are determined by
the classical perturbations of submanifolds contained in the Nash's
differentiable embedding theorem. In principle, quantum brane-world theory can
be tested by current experiments in astrophysics and by near future laboratory
experiments at Tev energy. The implications to the black-hole information loss
problem, to the accelerating cosmology, and to a quantum mathematical theory of
four-sub manifolds are briefly commented.
"
What is the relationship between Type II profiles and barred galaxies?,"  Surface-brightness profiles for early-type (S0-Sb) disks exhibit three main
classes (Type I, II, and III). Type II profiles are more common in barred
galaxies, and most of the time appear to be related to the bar's Outer Lindblad
Resonance. Roughly half of barred galaxies in the field have Type II profiles,
but almost none in the Virgo Cluster do; this might be related to ram-pressure
stripping in clusters. A strong \textit{anti}correlation is found between Type
III profiles (""antitruncations"") and bars: Type III profiles are most common
when there is no bar, and least common when there is a strong bar.
"
What is the main topic of the second article in the series?,"  This article is the $\mathrm{Z}_l$-version of my paper ""Monodromie du
faisceau pervers des cycles \'evanescents de quelques vari\'et\'es de Shimura
simples"" in Invent. Math. 2009 vol 177 pp. 239-280, where we study the
vanishing cycles of some unitary Shimura variety. The aim is to prove that the
cohomology sheaves of this complexe are free so that, thanks to the main
theorem of Berkovich on vanishing cycles, we can deduce that the
$\mathrm{Z}_l$-cohomology of the model of Deligne-Carayol is free. There will
be a second article which will be the $\mathrm{Z}_l$ version of my paper
""Conjecture de monodromie-poids pour quelques vari\'t\'es de Shimura unitaires""
in Compositio vol 146 part 2, pp. 367-403. The aim of this second article will
be to study the torsion of the cohomology groups of these Shimura varieties.
"
What are the properties of the Chebyshev polynomial expansion?,"  A linear scale method for calculating electronic properties of large and
complex systems is introduced within a local density approximation. The method
is based on the Chebyshev polynomial expansion and the time-dependent method,
which is tested in calculating the electronic structure of a model n-type GaAs
quantum dot.
"
What are the twisted rings of differential operators in the minimal orbit of the Zariski closure of the Borel subalgebra of the Universal Enveloping Algebra of the spin group of rank $2n$?,"  We investigate (twisted) rings of differential operators on the resolution of
singularities of a particular irreducible component of the (Zarisky) closure of
the minimal orbit $\bar O_{\mathrm{min}}$ of $\mathfrak{sp}_{2n}$, intersected
with the Borel subalgebra $\mathfrak n_+$ of $\mathfrak{sp}_{2n}$, using toric
geometry and show that they are homomorphic images of a subalgebra of the
Universal Enveloping Algebra (UEA) of $\mathfrak{sp}_{2n}$, which contains the
maximal parabolic subalgebra $\mathfrak p$ determining the minimal nilpotent
orbit. Further, using Fourier transforms on Weyl algebras, we show that
(twisted) rings of well-suited weighted projective spaces are obtained from the
same subalgebra. Finally, investigating this subalgebra from the
representation-theoretical point of view, we find new primitive ideals and
rediscover old ones for the UEA of $\mathfrak{sp}_{2n}$ coming from the
aforementioned resolution of singularities.
"
What is the quantum state transfer using a spin star in a quantum network?,"  Quantum state transfer is an important task in quantum information
processing. It is known that one can engineer the couplings of a
one-dimensional spin chain to achieve the goal of perfect state transfer. To
leverage the value of these spin chains, a spin star is potentially useful for
connecting different parts of a quantum network. In this work, we extend the
spin-chain engineering problem to the problems with a topology of a star
network. We show that a permanently coupled spin star can function as a network
switch for transferring quantum states selectively from one node to another by
varying the local potentials only. Together with one-dimensional chains, this
result allows applications of quantum state transfer be applied to more general
quantum networks.
"
What are the results of a deep optical-near-infrared multi-epoch survey of the Pleiades open star cluster?,"  We present the results of a deep optical-near-infrared multi-epoch survey
covering 2.5 square degrees of the Pleiades open star cluster to search for new
very-low-mass brown dwarf members. A significant (~ 5 year) epoch difference
exists between the optical (CFH12k I-, Z-band) and near infrared (UKIRT WFCAM
J-band) observations. We construct I,I-Z and Z,Z-J colour magnitude diagrams to
select candidate cluster members. Proper motions are computed for all candidate
members and compared to the background field objects to further refine the
sample. We recover all known cluster members within the area of our survey. In
addition, we have discovered 9 new candidate brown dwarf cluster members. The 7
faintest candidates have red Z-J colours and show blue near-infrared colours.
These are consistent with being L and T-type Pleiads. Theoretical models
predict their masses to be around 11 Jupiter masses.

"
What are the moduli space of semi-classical theories analogous to the structure of a Frobenius super-manifold?,"  We show that a semi-classical quantum field theory comes with a versal family
with the property that the corresponding partition function generates all path
integrals and satisfies a system of 2nd order differential equations determined
by algebras of classical observables. This versal family gives rise to a notion
of special coordinates that is analogous to that in string theories. We also
show that for a large class of semi-classical theories, their moduli space has
the structure of a Frobenius super-manifold.
"
What is the top quark observed at the Tevatron really the top quark of the standard model?,"  The large data samples of thousands of top events collected at the Tevatron
experiments CDF and D0 allow for a variety of measurements to analyze the
properties of the top quark. Guided by the question ""Is the top quark observed
at the Tevatron really the top quark of the standard model,'' we present
Tevatron analyses studying the top production mechanism including resonant
$t\bar{t}$ production, the V-A structure of the $t\to Wb$ decay vertex, the
charge of the top quark, and single-top production via flavor-changing neutral
currents.
"
What are the 5-adic space and its relation to the genetic code?,"  Degeneracy of the genetic code is a biological way to minimize effects of the
undesirable mutation changes. Degeneration has a natural description on the
5-adic space of 64 codons $\mathcal{C}_5 (64) = \{n_0 + n_1 5 + n_2 5^2
  : n_i = 1, 2, 3, 4 \} ,$ where $n_i$ are digits related to nucleotides as
follows: C = 1, A = 2, T = U = 3, G = 4. The smallest 5-adic distance between
codons joins them into 16 quadruplets, which under 2-adic distance decay into
32 doublets. p-Adically close codons are assigned to one of 20 amino acids,
which are building blocks of proteins, or code termination of protein
synthesis. We shown that genetic code multiplets are made of the p-adic nearest
codons.
"
What are the results of quantum Monte Carlo simulations in the two-dimensional Heisenberg antiferromagnet?,"  The study of impurities in antiferromagnets is of considerable interest in
condensed matter physics. In this paper we address the elementary question of
the effect of vacancies on the orientation of the surrounding magnetic moments
in an antiferromagnet. In the presence of a magnetic field, alternating
magnetic moments are induced, which can be described by a universal expression
that is valid in any ordered antiferromagnet and turns out to be independent of
temperature over a large range. The universality is not destroyed by quantum
fluctuation, which is demonstrated by quantum Monte Carlo simulations in the
two-dimensional Heisenberg antiferromagnet. Physical predictions for finite
doping are made, which are relevant for experiments probing Knight shifts and
the order parameter.
"
Can natural boundaries of Dirichlet series be used to determine the boundary of a ferromagnet with finite size?,"  We prove some conditions on the existence of natural boundaries of Dirichlet
series. We show that generically the presumed boundary is the natural one. We
also give an application of natural boundaries in determining asymptotic
results.
"
Can computational tools developed using synthetic siRNAs be used to investigate endogenous miRNAs?,"  Both short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and microRNAs (miRNAs) mediate the
repression of specific sequences of mRNA through the RNA interference pathway.
In the last years several experiments have supported the hypothesis that siRNAs
and miRNAs may be functionally interchangeable, at least in cultured cells. In
this work we verify that this hypothesis is also supported by a computational
evidence. We show that a method specifically trained to predict the activity of
the exogenous siRNAs assigns a high silencing level to experimentally
determined human miRNAs. This result not only supports the idea of siRNAs and
miRNAs equivalence but indicates that it is possible to use computational tools
developed using synthetic small interference RNAs to investigate endogenous
miRNAs.
"
What is the LDA+Gutzwiller method used to treat the correlated electron systems?,"  Combining the density functional theory (DFT) and the Gutzwiller variational
approach, a LDA+Gutzwiller method is developed to treat the correlated electron
systems from {\it ab-initio}. All variational parameters are self-consistently
determined from total energy minimization. The method is computationally
cheaper, yet the quasi-particle spectrum is well described through kinetic
energy renormalization. It can be applied equally to the systems from weakly
correlated metals to strongly correlated insulators. The calculated results for
SrVO$_3$, Fe, Ni and NiO, show dramatic improvement over LDA and LDA+U.
"
What are the results of the photometric measurements of central surface brightness of globular clusters?,"  We use Hubble Space Telescope archival images to measure central surface
brightness profiles of globular clusters around satellite galaxies of the Milky
Way. We report results for 21 clusters around the LMC, 5 around the SMC, and 4
around the Fornax dwarf galaxy. The profiles are obtained using a recently
developed technique based on measuring integrated light, which is tested on an
extensive simulated dataset. Our results show that for 70% of the sample, the
central photometric points of our profiles are brighter than previous
measurements using star counts with deviations as large as 2 mag/arcsec^2.
About 40% of the objects have central profiles deviating from a flat central
core, with central logarithmic slopes continuously distributed between -0.2 and
-1.2. These results are compared with those found for a sample of Galactic
clusters using the same method. We confirm the known correlation in which
younger clusters tend to have smaller core radii, and we find that they also
have brighter central surface brightness values. This seems to indicate that
globular clusters might be born relatively concentrated, and that a profile
with extended flat cores might not be the ideal choice for initial profiles in
theoretical models.
"
Do the slopes of the PM and PW relations for BL Her stars agree with the slopes determined by observed variables in Galactic globular clusters?,"  We investigate the properties of the so-called BL Her stars, i.e., Population
II Cepheids with periods shorter than 8 days, using updated pulsation models
and evolutionary tracks computed adopting a metal abundance in the range of
Z=0.0001 to Z=0.004. We derive the predicted Period-Magnitude (PM) and
Period-Wesenheit (PW) relations at the various photometric bands and we show
that the slopes of these relations are in good agreement with the slopes
determined by observed variables in Galactic globular clusters, independently
of the adopted M_V(RR)-[Fe/H] relation to get the cluster RR Lyrae-based
distance. Moreover, we show that also the distances provided by the predicted
PM and PW relations for BL Her stars agree within the errors with the RR Lyrae
based values. The use of the predicted relations with W Vir stars, which are
Population II Cepheids with periods longer than 8 days, provides no clear
evidence for or against a change in the PM and PW slopes around P~10 days.
"
How does the method compare to standard methods in real data from two toxicology experiments with mice?,"  DNA microarray experiments, a well-established experimental technique, aim at
understanding the function of genes in some biological processes. One of the
most common experiments in functional genomics research is to compare two
groups of microarray data to determine which genes are differentially
expressed. In this paper, we propose a methodology to estimate the proportion
of differentially expressed genes in such experiments. We study the performance
of our method in a simulation study where we compare it to other standard
methods. Finally we compare the methods in real data from two toxicology
experiments with mice.
"
What is the annihilation cross section of light dark matter particles into two photons?,"  We compute the pair annihilation cross section of light dark matter scalar
particles into two photons, and discuss the detectability of the monochromatic
line associated with these annihilations.
"
What are the Hawking radiation and de Sitter cosmological horizon in the context of black holes?,"  Recently, Hawking radiation has been treated, by Robinson and Wilczek, as a
compensating flux of the energy momentum tensor required to cancel gavitational
anomaly at the event horizon(EH) of a Schwarzschild-type black hole. In this
paper, motivated by their work, Hawking radiation from the event horizon(EH)
and the de Sitter cosmological horizon(CH) of black holes in de Sitter spaces,
specifically including the purely de Sitter black hole, and the static,
spherically symmetric Schwarzschild-de Sitter black hole as well as the
rotating Kerr-de Sitter black hole, has been studied by anomalies. The result
shows that the gauge current and energy momentum tensor fluxes, required to
restore gauge invariance and general coordinate covariance at the EH and the
CH, are precisely equal to those of Hawking radiation from the EH and the CH,
respectively. It should be noted that, gauge and gravitational anomalies taken
place at the cosmological horizon(CH) arise from the fact that the effective
field theory is formulated inside the CH to integrate out the classically
irrelevant outgoing modes at the CH, which is different from those at the black
hole horizon(EH).
"
What is the effect of the in-plane and out-of-plane components of the magnetic field on the magneto-photoluminescence spectra?,"  We studied the circular polarization and angular dependences of the
magneto-photoluminescence spectra of the free A-exciton 1S state in wurtzite
ZnO at T = 5 K. The circular polarization properties of the spectra clearly
indicate that the top valence band has Gamma_7 symmetry. The out-of-plane
component of the magnetic field, which is parallel to the sample's c axis,
leads to linear Zeeman splitting of both the dipole-allowed Gamma_5 exciton
state and the weakly allowed Gamma_1/Gamma_2 exciton states. The in-plane
field, which is perpendicular to the c axis, increases the oscillator strength
of the weak Gamma_1/Gamma_2 states by forming a mixed exciton state.
"
How do the models of chemotactic aggregation relate to the chemotactic collapse and gravitational collapse in self-gravitating systems?,"  We derive general kinetic and hydrodynamic models of chemotactic aggregation
that describe certain features of the morphogenesis of biological colonies
(like bacteria, amoebae, endothelial cells or social insects). Starting from a
stochastic model defined in terms of N coupled Langevin equations, we derive a
nonlinear mean field Fokker-Planck equation governing the evolution of the
distribution function of the system in phase space. By taking the successive
moments of this kinetic equation and using a local thermodynamic equilibrium
condition, we derive a set of hydrodynamic equations involving a damping term.
In the limit of small frictions, we obtain a hyperbolic model describing the
formation of network patterns (filaments) and in the limit of strong frictions
we obtain a parabolic model which is a generalization of the standard
Keller-Segel model describing the formation of clusters (clumps). Our approach
connects and generalizes several models introduced in the chemotactic
literature. We discuss the analogy between bacterial colonies and
self-gravitating systems and between the chemotactic collapse and the
gravitational collapse (Jeans instability). We also show that the basic
equations of chemotaxis are similar to nonlinear mean field Fokker-Planck
equations so that a notion of effective generalized thermodynamics can be
developed.
"
What is the smeared renormalised energy density of a quantum field limited by Quantum Weak Energy Inequalities (QWEIs)?,"  Quantum Weak Energy Inequalities (QWEIs) are results which limit the extent
to which the smeared renormalised energy density of a quantum field can be
negative. On globally hyperbolic spacetimes the massive quantum Dirac field is
known to obey a QWEI in terms of a reference state chosen arbitrarily from the
class of Hadamard states; however, there exist spacetimes of interest on which
state-dependent bounds cannot be evaluated. In this paper we prove the first
QWEI for the massive quantum Dirac field on four dimensional globally
hyperbolic spacetime in which the bound depends only on the local geometry;
such a QWEI is known as an absolute QWEI.
"
What are the four specific examples of new physics with 1 fb^-1 of LHC data?,"  The challenges for a discovery of new physics with 1 fb^-1 of LHC data for
ATLAS and CMS are discussed. Four specific examples are chosen: a deviation of
QCD jet distributions at high E_T, high-mass dilepton pairs, Higgs search in
the WW decay channel, and low mass supersymmetry.
"
What is the timing ephemeris of the 136 ms pulsar spanning 6 years?,"  We present new X-ray timing and spectral observations of PSR J1930+1852, the
young energetic pulsar at the center of the non-thermal supernova remnant
G54.1+0.3. Using data obtained with the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer and Chandra
X-ray observatories we have derived an updated timing ephemeris of the 136 ms
pulsar spanning 6 years. During this interval, however, the period evolution
shows significant variability from the best fit constant spin-down rate of
$\dot P = 7.5112(6) \times 10^{-13}$ s s$^{-1}$, suggesting strong timing noise
and/or glitch activity. The X-ray emission is highly pulsed ($71\pm5%$
modulation) and is characterized by an asymmetric, broad profile ($\sim 70%$
duty cycle) which is nearly twice the radio width. The spectrum of the pulsed
emission is well fitted with an absorbed power law of photon index $\Gamma =
1.2\pm0.2$; this is marginally harder than that of the unpulsed component. The
total 2-10 keV flux of the pulsar is $1.7 \times 10^{-12}$ erg cm$^{-2}$
s$^{-1}$. These results confirm PSR J1930+1852 as a typical Crab-like pulsar.
"
What is the hypothesis of ether-dragging compatible with the theory of relativity?,"  This paper revisits previous papers related to the theory of relativity.
Afterwards, a reconsideration of the hypothesis of ether-dragging is discussed.
The ether is compatible with the theory of relativity and historical
experiments; this paper explains the Michelson-Morley experiment using the
ether-dragging hypothesis without the orthodox interpretation that the speed c
is a fixed constant in terms of any system of inertial coordinates.
"
What are the quasibound states in the helium-antihydrogen system?,"  Potential energy curves for excited leptonic states of the
helium-antihydrogen system are calculated within Ritz' variational approach. An
explicitly correlated ansatz for the leptonic wave function is employed
describing accurately the motion of the leptons (two electrons and positron) in
the field of the helium nucleus and of the antiproton with arbitrary orbital
angular momentum projection $\Lambda$ onto the internuclear axis. Results for
$\Lambda$=0, 1 and 30 are presented. For quasibound states with large values of
$\Lambda$ and rotational quantum numbers $J>\Lambda$ no annihilation and
rearrangement decay channels occur, i. e. they are metastable.
"
What is the physical picture of the transition from a Wigner crystal to a heavy Fermi liquid?,"  We consider an interaction-driven scenario for the two-dimensional
metal-insulator transition in zero magnetic field (2D-MIT), based on melting
the Wigner crystal through vacancy-interstitial pair formation. We show that
the transition from the Wigner-Mott insulator to a heavy Fermi liquid emerges
as an instability to self-doping, resembling conceptually the solid to normal
liquid transition in He3. The resulting physical picture naturally explains
many puzzling features of the 2D-MIT.
"
What is the relationship between the leading irrelevant operators and the primordial power spectrum?,"  This article examines how a breakdown of a locally Lorentz invariant,
point-like description of nature at tiny space-time intervals would translate
into a distinctive set of signals in the primordial power spectrum generated by
inflation. We examine the leading irrelevant operators that are consistent with
the spatial translations and rotations of a preferred, isotropically expanding,
background. A few of the resulting corrections to the primordial power spectrum
do not have the usual oscillatory factor, which is sometimes taken to be
characteristic of a ""trans-Planckian"" signal. Perhaps more interestingly, one
of these leading irrelevant operators exactly reproduces a correction to the
power spectrum that occurs in effective descriptions of the state of the field
responsible for inflation.
"
What are the universality classes of mechanical behavior in particulate systems with attraction?,"  We numerically study the jamming transition in particulate systems with
attraction by investigating their mechanical response at zero temperature. We
find three regimes of mechanical behavior separated by two critical
transitions--connectivity and rigidity percolation. The transitions belong to
different universality classes than their lattice counterparts, due to force
balance constraints. We also find that these transitions are unchanged at low
temperatures and resemble gelation transitions in experiments on colloidal and
silica gels.
"
What are the implications of the 4-post-Newtonian order correction for the EOB radial potential?,"  We present an accurate approximation of the full gravitational radiation
waveforms generated in the merger of non-eccentric systems of two non-spinning
black holes. Utilizing information from recent numerical relativity simulations
and the natural flexibility of the effective-one-body (EOB) model, we extend
the latter so that it can successfully match the numerical relativity waveforms
during the last stages of inspiral, merger and ringdown. By ``successfully''
here, we mean with phase differences < 8% of a gravitational-wave cycle
accumulated by the end of the ringdown phase, maximizing only over time of
arrival and initial phase. We obtain this result by simply adding a
4-post-Newtonian order correction in the EOB radial potential and determining
the (constant) coefficient by imposing high-matching performances with
numerical waveforms of mass ratios m1/m2 = 1, 3/2, 2 and 4, m1 and m2 being the
individual black-hole masses. The final black-hole mass and spin predicted by
the numerical simulations are used to determine the ringdown frequency and
decay time of three quasi-normal-mode damped sinusoids that are attached to the
EOB inspiral-(plunge) waveform at the EOB light-ring. The EOB waveforms might
be tested and further improved in the future by comparison with extremely long
and accurate inspiral numerical-relativity waveforms. They may already be
employed for coherent searches and parameter estimation of gravitational waves
emitted by non-spinning coalescing binary black holes with ground-based
laser-interferometer detectors.
"
What are the electron and hole concentrations in a graphene sheet?,"  We suggest a simple model of disorder in graphene assuming that there are
randomly distributed positive and negative centers with equal concentration
$N/2$ in the bulk of silicon oxide substrate. We show that at zero gate voltage
such disorder creates two-dimensional concentration $n_0 \sim N^{2/3}$ of
electrons and holes in graphene. Electrons and holes reside in alternating in
space puddles of the size $R_0 \sim N^{-1/3}$. A typical puddle has only one or
two carriers in agreement with recent scanning single electron transistor
experiment.
"
What are the proposed tests for testing whether the shape matrix of an elliptical distribution has a specific fixed value?,"  We propose a class of rank-based procedures for testing that the shape matrix
$\mathbf{V}$ of an elliptical distribution (with unspecified center of
symmetry, scale and radial density) has some fixed value ${\mathbf{V}}_0$; this
includes, for ${\mathbf{V}}_0={\mathbf{I}}_k$, the problem of testing for
sphericity as an important particular case. The proposed tests are invariant
under translations, monotone radial transformations, rotations and reflections
with respect to the estimated center of symmetry. They are valid without any
moment assumption. For adequately chosen scores, they are locally
asymptotically maximin (in the Le Cam sense) at given radial densities. They
are strictly distribution-free when the center of symmetry is specified, and
asymptotically so when it must be estimated. The multivariate ranks used
throughout are those of the distances--in the metric associated with the null
value ${\mathbf{V}}_0$ of the shape matrix--between the observations and the
(estimated) center of the distribution. Local powers (against elliptical
alternatives) and asymptotic relative efficiencies (AREs) are derived with
respect to the adjusted Mauchly test (a modified version of the Gaussian
likelihood ratio procedure proposed by Muirhead and Waternaux [Biometrika 67
(1980) 31--43]) or, equivalently, with respect to (an extension of) the test
for sphericity introduced by John [Biometrika 58 (1971) 169--174]. For Gaussian
scores, these AREs are uniformly larger than one, irrespective of the actual
radial density. Necessary and/or sufficient conditions for consistency under
nonlocal, possibly nonelliptical alternatives are given. Finite sample
performances are investigated via a Monte Carlo study.
"
What is the iron K-shell complex in the Seyfert 1.9 galaxy MCG-5-23-16 best modeled with?,"  We present the results of the simultaneous deep XMM and Chandra observations
of the bright Seyfert 1.9 galaxy MCG-5-23-16, which is thought to have one of
the best known examples of a relativistically broadened iron K-alpha line. The
time averaged spectral analysis shows that the iron K-shell complex is best
modeled with an unresolved narrow emission component (FWHM < 5000 km/s, EW ~ 60
eV) plus a broad component. This latter component has FWHM ~ 44000 km/s and EW
~ 50 eV. Its profile is well described by an emission line originating from an
accretion disk viewed with an inclination angle ~ 40^\circ and with the
emission arising from within a few tens of gravitational radii of the central
black hole. The time-resolved spectral analysis of the XMM EPIC-pn spectrum
shows that both the narrow and broad components of the Fe K emission line
appear to be constant in time within the errors. We detected a narrow sporadic
absorption line at 7.7 keV which appears to be variable on a time-scale of 20
ksec. If associated with Fe XXVI Ly-alpha this absorption is indicative of a
possibly variable, high ionization, high velocity outflow. The variability of
this absorption feature appears to rule out a local (z=0) origin. The analysis
of the XMM RGS spectrum reveals that the soft X-ray emission of MCG-5-23-16 is
likely dominated by several emission lines superimposed on an unabsorbed
scattered power-law continuum. The lack of strong Fe L shell emission together
with the detection of a strong forbidden line in the O VII triplet is
consistent with a scenario where the soft X-ray emission lines are produced in
a plasma photoionized by the nuclear emission.
"
"What are the microscopic parameters that can be tuned in the core, shell and interfacial regions of a nanoparticle?","  We present an atomistic model of a single nanoparticle with core/shell
structure that takes into account its lattice strucutre and spherical geometry,
and in which the values of microscopic parameters such as anisotropy and
exchange constants can be tuned in the core, shell and interfacial regions. By
means of Monte Carlo simulations of the hysteresis loops based on this model,
we have determined the range of microscopic parameters for which loop shifts
after field cooling can be observed. The study of the magnetic order of the
interfacial spins for different particles sizes and values of the interfacial
exchange coupling have allowed us to correlate the appearance of loop
asymmetries and vertical displacements to the existence of a fraction of
uncompensated spins at the shell interface that remain pinned during field
cycling, offering new insight on the microscopic origin of the experimental
phenomenology.
"
What is the principle of the equation-free approach to implementing statistical moment closures?,"  We present a general numerical scheme for the practical implementation of
statistical moment closures suitable for modeling complex, large-scale,
nonlinear systems. Building on recently developed equation-free methods, this
approach numerically integrates the closure dynamics, the equations of which
may not even be available in closed form. Although closure dynamics introduce
statistical assumptions of unknown validity, they can have significant
computational advantages as they typically have fewer degrees of freedom and
may be much less stiff than the original detailed model. The closure method can
in principle be applied to a wide class of nonlinear problems, including
strongly-coupled systems (either deterministic or stochastic) for which there
may be no scale separation. We demonstrate the equation-free approach for
implementing entropy-based Eyink-Levermore closures on a nonlinear stochastic
partial differential equation.
"
What are the phenomena that appear in the metallic state of a one-dimensional solid?,"  As the dimensionality is reduced, the world becomes more and more
interesting; novel and fascinating phenomena show up which call for
understanding. Physics in one dimension is a fascinating topic for theory and
experiment: for the former often a simplification, for the latter always a
challenge. Various ways will be demonstrated how one-dimensional structures can
be achieved in reality. In particular organic conductors could establish
themselves as model systems for the investigation of the physics in reduced
dimensions.
  In the metallic state of a one-dimensional solid, Fermi-liquid theory breaks
down and spin and charge degrees of freedom become separated. But the metallic
phase is not stable in one dimension: as the temperature is reduced, the
electronic charge and spin tend to arrange themselves in an ordered fashion due
to strong correlations. The competition of the different interactions is
responsible for which broken-symmetry ground state is eventually realized in a
specific compound and which drives the system towards an insulating state.
  Here we review the various ordering phenomena and how they can be identified
by dielectric and optic measurements.
"
What are the convex hull algorithms in the theory of buildings?,"  The notion of convexity in tropical geometry is closely related to notions of
convexity in the theory of affine buildings. We explore this relationship from
a combinatorial and computational perspective. Our results include a convex
hull algorithm for the Bruhat--Tits building of SL$_d(K)$ and techniques for
computing with apartments and membranes. While the original inspiration was the
work of Dress and Terhalle in phylogenetics, and of Faltings, Kapranov, Keel
and Tevelev in algebraic geometry, our tropical algorithms will also be
applicable to problems in other fields of mathematics.
"
What is the relationship between braiding transformation and quantum entanglement?,"  We show that braiding transformation is a natural approach to describe
quantum entanglement, by using the unitary braiding operators to realize
entanglement swapping and generate the GHZ states as well as the linear cluster
states. A Hamiltonian is constructed from the unitary
$\check{R}_{i,i+1}(\theta,\phi)$-matrix, where $\phi=\omega t$ is
time-dependent while $\theta$ is time-independent. This in turn allows us to
investigate the Berry phase in the entanglement space.
"
What are the main photometric and structural parameters of Sextans B?,"  We present spectroscopic observations of a massive globular cluster in the
dwarf irregular galaxy Sextans B, discovered by us on Hubble Space Telescope
Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2 (HST WFPC2) images. Long-slit spectra were
obtained with the SCORPIO spectrograph on the the 6-m telescope at the Special
Astrophysical observatory of the Russian Academy of Sciences. We determine age,
metallicity and alpha-element abundance ratio for the globular cluster to be $
2 \pm 1$ Gyr, $-1.35 \pm 0.25$ dex, and $ 0.1 \pm 0.1$ dex, respectively. Main
photometric and structural parameters of it were determined using our surface
photometry on the HST images. The mass ($\sim 10^5 M \sun$), luminosity and
structural parameters appear to be typical for the globular clusters in our own
Galaxy. Our findings shed a new light on the evolutionary history of Sextans B.
"
What are the components of the setup of this scheme?,"  We present a faithful qubit transmission scheme with linear optics against
collective noise, not resorting to ancillary qubits. Its set-up is composed of
three unbalanced polarization interferometers, based on a polarizing beam
splitter, a beam splitter and a half-wave plate, which makes this scheme more
feasible than others with present technology. The fidelity of successful
transmission is 1, independent of the parameters of the collective noise, and
the success probability for obtaining an uncorrupted state can be improved to
100% with some time delayers. Moreover, this scheme has some good applications
in one-way quantum communication for rejecting the errors caused by the
collective noise in quantum channel.
"
What is the Galerkin finite element method for solving the 2- and 3-dimensional wave equations and equations of incompressible flow?,"  We introduce a new mixed discontinuous/continuous Galerkin finite element for
solving the 2- and 3-dimensional wave equations and equations of incompressible
flow. The element, which we refer to as P1dg-P2, uses discontinuous piecewise
linear functions for velocity and continuous piecewise quadratic functions for
pressure. The aim of introducing the mixed formulation is to produce a new
flexible element choice for triangular and tetrahedral meshes which satisfies
the LBB stability condition and hence has no spurious zero-energy modes. We
illustrate this property with numerical integrations of the wave equation in
two dimensions, an analysis of the resultant discrete Laplace operator in two
and three dimensions, and a normal mode analysis of the semi-discrete wave
equation in one dimension.
"
What is the importance of providing high-quality nuclear data for astrophysical research?,"  A necessary condition for the reliable modelling of the structure or
evolution of the stars and of their concomitant nucleosynthesis is the
availability of good quality nuclear data in a very wide area of the chart of
nuclides. This short review presents a non-exhaustive list of nuclear data of
astrophysics interest (masses, $\beta$-decays, thermonuclear and
non-thermonuclear reaction rates) for nuclides at the bottom of the valley of
nuclear stability (mainly involved in the modelling of non-explosive phases of
stellar evolution), or for more or less highly exotic nuclides (to be
considered in the description of stellar explosions). Special emphasis is put
on the importance of providing quality nuclear data bases that can be easily
used by astrophysicists.
"
What is the significance of the difference between the transversity distributions and the longitudinally polarized distributions in the context of the transverse spin asymmetry?,"  A first empirical extraction of the transversity distributions for the $u$-
and $d$-quarks has been done by Anselmino {\it et al.} based on the combined
global analysis of the measured azimuthal asymmetries in semi-inclusive deep
inelastic scatterings and those in $e^+ e^- \to h_1 h_2 X$ processes. Although
with large uncertainties, the determined transversity distributions already
appear to reveal a remarkable qualitative difference with the corresponding
longitudinally polarized distributions. We point out that this difference
contains very important information on internal spin structure of the nucleon.
"
What are the two optimization problems addressed in this paper for non-cooperative links sharing the same physical resources?,"  In this two-part paper, we address the problem of finding the optimal
precoding/multiplexing scheme for a set of non-cooperative links sharing the
same physical resources, e.g., time and bandwidth. We consider two alternative
optimization problems: P.1) the maximization of mutual information on each
link, given constraints on the transmit power and spectral mask; and P.2) the
maximization of the transmission rate on each link, using finite order
constellations, under the same constraints as in P.1, plus a constraint on the
maximum average error probability on each link. Aiming at finding decentralized
strategies, we adopted as optimality criterion the achievement of a Nash
equilibrium and thus we formulated both problems P.1 and P.2 as strategic
noncooperative (matrix-valued) games. In Part I of this two-part paper, after
deriving the optimal structure of the linear transceivers for both games, we
provided a unified set of sufficient conditions that guarantee the uniqueness
of the Nash equilibrium. In this Part II, we focus on the achievement of the
equilibrium and propose alternative distributed iterative algorithms that solve
both games. Specifically, the new proposed algorithms are the following: 1) the
sequential and simultaneous iterative waterfilling based algorithms,
incorporating spectral mask constraints; 2) the sequential and simultaneous
gradient projection based algorithms, establishing an interesting link with
variational inequality problems. Our main contribution is to provide sufficient
conditions for the global convergence of all the proposed algorithms which,
although derived under stronger constraints, incorporating for example spectral
mask constraints, have a broader validity than the convergence conditions known
in the current literature for the sequential iterative waterfilling algorithm.
"
What is the explicit form of matter wave functions in the modular bootstrap framework?,"  We study boundary states in (p,q) minimal superstring theory, combining the
explicit form of matter wave functions. Within the modular bootstrap framework,
Cardy states of (p,q) minimal superconformal field theory are completely
determined in both cases of the different supercharge combinations, and the
remaining consistency checks in the super-Liouville case are also performed.
Using these boundary states, we determine the explicit form of FZZT- and
ZZ-brane boundary states both in type 0A and 0B GSO projections. Annulus
mplitudes of FZZT branes are evaluated and principal FZZT branes are
identified. In particular, we found that these principal FZZT branes do not
satisfy Cardy's consistency conditions for each other and play a role of
order/disorder parameters of the Kramers-Wannier duality in spacetime of this
superstring theory.
"
What are the dispersive estimates in the high-frequency limit for the wave and the Schrodinger groupes?,"  We prove dispersive estimates at high frequency in dimension two for both the
wave and the Schrodinger groupes for a very large class of real-valued
potentials.
"
What are the conditions that can lead to the formation of vortices in BECs?,"  An apparatus for producing atomic-gas Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) of
87-Rb atoms is described. The apparatus produces 87-Rb BECs in a dual-chamber
vacuum system that incorporates magnetic transport of trapped atoms from the
magneto-optical trapping cell to the BEC production cell via the operation of a
series of overlapping magnet coils. The design, construction, and operation of
the apparatus are described in detail. The apparatus is used to study the
creation of quantized vortices in BECs by the merging and interference of
multiple trapped condensates. In this experiment, a single harmonic potential
well is partitioned into three sections by an optical barrier, enabling the
simultaneous formation of three independent, uncorrelated BECs. The BECs may
either merge together during their growth, or, for high-energy barriers, the
BECs can be merged together by barrier removal after their formation. Either
process may instigate vortex formation in the resulting BEC, depending on the
initially indeterminate relative phases of the condensates and the merging
rate.
"
What is the melting temperature of W nanoparticles?,"  We report a molecular dynamics simulation of melting of tungsten (W)
nanoparticles. The modified embedded atom method (MEAM) interatomic potentials
are used to describe the interaction between tungsten atoms. The melting
temperature of unsupported tungsten nanoparticles of different sizes are found
to decrease as the size of the particles decreases. The melting temperature
obtained in the present study is approximately a decreasing function of inverse
radius, in a good agreement with the predictions of thermodynamic models. We
also observed that the melting of a W nanoparticle is preceded by the
premelting of its outer skin at a temperature lower than its melting
temperature.
"
What is the use of a transition layer in a backward-wave slab?,"  A backward-wave slab based on a capacitively and inductively loaded
three-dimensional transmission-line network is designed in such a way that
impedance-matching with free space is obtained. To enable field propagation
from free space to the network and vice versa, the use of a transition layer is
proposed. Matching of the designed network with free space and negative
refraction occurring at the slab interfaces are confirmed with full-wave
simulations.
"
How is the companion matrix of X^p-c_{p-1}X^{p-1}-...-c_1X-c_0I represented as C^z\alpha?,"  Suppose A\in GL_n(\C) has a relation A^p=c_{p-1}A^{p-1}+.... + c_1 A+ c_0I
where the c_i in \C. This article describes how to construct analytic functions
c_i(z) such that A^z=c_{p-1}(z)A^{p-1}+... + c_1(z) A+ c_0(z)I . One of the
theorems gives a possible description of the c_i(z): c_i(z)=C^z\alpha where
C\in Mat_p(\C) is (similar to) the companion matrix of X^p-c_{p-1}X^{p-1}-...
-c_1X-c_0I, and \alpha:= (c_{p-1},...,c_1,c_0)^t.
"
What are the key science objectives of the EXIST mission?,"  The synergy of GLAST and the proposed EXIST mission as the Black Hole Finder
Probe in the Beyond Einstein Program is remarkable. With its full-sky per orbit
hard X-ray imaging (3-600 keV) and ""nuFnu"" sensitivity comparable to GLAST,
EXIST could measure variability and spectra of Blazars in the hard X-ray
synchrotron component simultaneous with GLAST (~10-100GeV) measures of the
inverse Compton component, thereby uniquely constraining intrinsic source
spectra and allowing measured high energy spectral breaks to measure the cosmic
diffuse extra-galactic background light (EBL) by determining the intervening
diffuse IR photon field required to yield the observed break from photon-photon
absorption. Such studies also constrain the physics of jets (and parameters and
indeed the validity of SSC models) and the origin of the >100 MeV gamma-ray
diffuse background likely arising from Blazars and jet-dominated sources. An
overview of the EXIST mission, which could fly in the GLAST era, is given
together with a synopsis of other key synergies of GLAST-EXIST science.
"
What is the relationship between the compactness of the complex Green operator Gq and the compactness of the Neumann operator Nq on Ω?,"  Let $\Omega\subset\C^n$ be a bounded smooth pseudoconvex domain. We show that
compactness of the complex Green operator $G_{q}$ on $(0,q)$-forms on $b\Omega$
implies compactness of the $\bar{\partial}$-Neumann operator $N_{q}$ on
$\Omega$. We prove that if $1 \leq q \leq n-2$ and $b\Omega$ satisfies $(P_q)$
and $(P_{n-q-1})$, then $G_{q}$ is a compact operator (and so is $G_{n-1-q}$).
Our method relies on a jump type formula to represent forms on the boundary,
and we prove an auxiliary compactness result for an `annulus' between two
pseudoconvex domains. Our results, combined with the known characterization of
compactness in the $\bar{\partial}$-Neumann problem on locally convexifiable
domains, yield the corresponding characterization of compactness of the complex
Green operator(s) on these domains.
"
What are the results of the investigation of Colour Reconnection effects in fully hadronic decays of W pairs in DELPHI at LEP?,"  In the reaction e+e- -> WW -> (q_1 qbar_2)(q_3 qbar_4) the usual
hadronization models treat the colour singlets q_1 qbar_2 and q_3 qbar_4 coming
from two W bosons independently. However, since the final state partons may
coexist in space and time, cross-talk between the two evolving hadronic systems
may be possible during fragmentation through soft gluon exchange. This effect
is known as Colour Reconnection. In this article the results of the
investigation of Colour Reconnection effects in fully hadronic decays of W
pairs in DELPHI at LEP are presented. Two complementary analyses were
performed, studying the particle flow between jets and W mass estimators, with
negligible correlation between them, and the results were combined and compared
to models. In the framework of the SK-I model, the value for its kappa
parameter most compatible with the data was found to be: kappa_{SK-I} =
2.2^{+2.5}_{-1.3} corresponding to the probability of reconnection P_{reco} to
be in the range 0.31 < P_{reco} < 0.68 at 68% confidence level with its best
value at 0.52.
"
What is the parallelization scheme used in the ab initio plane-wave code ABINIT?,"  We suggest and implement a parallelization scheme based on an efficient
multiband eigenvalue solver, called the locally optimal block preconditioned
conjugate gradient LOBPCG method, and using an optimized three-dimensional (3D)
fast Fourier transform (FFT) in the ab initio}plane-wave code ABINIT. In
addition to the standard data partitioning over processors corresponding to
different k-points, we introduce data partitioning with respect to blocks of
bands as well as spatial partitioning in the Fourier space of coefficients over
the plane waves basis set used in ABINIT. This k-points-multiband-FFT
parallelization avoids any collective communications on the whole set of
processors relying instead on one-dimensional communications only. For a single
k-point, super-linear scaling is achieved for up to 100 processors due to an
extensive use of hardware optimized BLAS, LAPACK, and SCALAPACK routines,
mainly in the LOBPCG routine. We observe good performance up to 200 processors.
With 10 k-points our three-way data partitioning results in linear scaling up
to 1000 processors for a practical system used for testing.
"
What are Infrared-Faint Radio Sources and what are the implications of their detection?,"  Infrared-Faint Radio Sources represent a new and unexpected class of object
which is bright at radio wavelengths but unusually faint at infrared
wavelengths. If, like most mJy radio sources, they were either conventional
active or star-forming galaxies in the local Universe, we would expect them to
be detectable at infrared wavelengths, and so their non-detection by the
Spitzer Space Telescope is surprising. Here we report the detection of one of
these sources using Very Long Baseline Interferometry, from which we conclude
that the sources are driven by Active Galactic Nuclei. We suggest that these
sources are either normal radio-loud quasars at high redshift or abnormally
obscured radio galaxies.
"
What is the role of the spin-orbit interaction in the two-dimensional electron gas in a ring?,"  Quantum interference effects in rings provide suitable means for controlling
spin at mesoscopic scales. Here we apply such a control mechanism to the
spin-dependent transport in a ballistic quasi one dimensional ring patterned in
two dimensional electron gases (2DEGs). The study is essentially based on the
{\it natural} spin-orbit (SO) interactions, one arising from the laterally
confining electric field {($\beta$ term) and the other due to to the
quantum-well potential that confines electrons in the 2DEG (conventional Rashba
SO interaction or $\alpha$ term).} We focus on single-channel transport and
solve analytically the spin polarization of the current. As an important
consequence of the presence of spin splitting, we find the occurrence of spin
dependent current oscillations.
  We analyze %the effects of disorder by discussing the transport in the
presence of one non-magnetic obstacle in the ring. We demonstrate that a spin
polarized current can be induced when an unpolarized charge current is injected
in the ring, by focusing on the central role that the presence of the obstacle
plays.
"
What are the eigenvalues of the final member of a parallel transporting family of unitary operators?,"  Nodal free geometric phases are the eigenvalues of the final member of a
parallel transporting family of unitary operators. These phases are gauge
invariant, always well-defined, and can be measured interferometrically. Nodal
free geometric phases can be used to construct various types of quantum phase
gates.
"
What is the ionic configuration used to calculate the excitation energies of small neutral sodium clusters?,"  We calculate the excitation energies of small neutral sodium clusters in the
framework of time-dependent density-functional theory. In the presented
calculations, we extract these energies from the power spectra of the dipole
and quadrupole signals that result from a real-time and real-space propagation.
For comparison with measured photoelectron spectra, we use the ionic
configurations of the corresponding single-charged anions. Our calculations
clearly improve on earlier results for photoelectron spectra obtained from
static Kohn-Sham eigenvalues.
"
What are the trade-offs in terms of depth and space complexity of the new technique?,"  We present a novel automated technique for parallelizing quantum circuits via
forward and backward translation to measurement-based quantum computing
patterns and analyze the trade off in terms of depth and space complexity. As a
result we distinguish a class of polynomial depth circuits that can be
parallelized to logarithmic depth while adding only polynomial many auxiliary
qubits. In particular, we provide for the first time a full characterization of
patterns with flow of arbitrary depth, based on the notion of influencing paths
and a simple rewriting system on the angles of the measurement. Our method
leads to insightful knowledge for constructing parallel circuits and as
applications, we demonstrate several constant and logarithmic depth circuits.
Furthermore, we prove a logarithmic separation in terms of quantum depth
between the quantum circuit model and the measurement-based model.
"
How are stable anti Yetter-Drinfel'd modules over x_R-Hopf algebras related to para-cyclic objects Z^*?,"  For a (co)monad T_l on a category M, an object X in M, and a functor \Pi: M
\to C, there is a (co)simplex Z^*:=\Pi T_l^{* +1} X in C. Our aim is to find
criteria for para-(co)cyclicity of Z^*. Construction is built on a distributive
law of T_l with a second (co)monad T_r on M, a natural transformation i:\Pi T_l
\to \Pi T_r, and a morphism w: T_r X \to T_l X in M. The relations i and w need
to satisfy are categorical versions of Kaygun's axioms of a transposition map.
Motivation comes from the observation that a (co)ring T over an algebra R
determines a distributive law of two (co)monads T_l=T \otimes_R (-) and T_r =
(-)\otimes_R T on the category of R-bimodules. The functor \Pi can be chosen
such that Z^n= T\hat{\otimes}_R... \hat{\otimes}_R T \hat{\otimes}_R X is the
cyclic R-module tensor product. A natural transformation i:T \hat{\otimes}_R
(-) \to (-) \hat{\otimes}_R T is given by the flip map and a morphism w: X
\otimes_R T \to T\otimes_R X is constructed whenever T is a (co)module algebra
or coring of an R-bialgebroid. Stable anti Yetter-Drinfel'd modules over
certain bialgebroids, so called x_R-Hopf algebras, are introduced. In the
particular example when T is a module coring of a x_R-Hopf algebra B and X is a
stable anti Yetter-Drinfel'd B-module, the para-cyclic object Z_* is shown to
project to a cyclic structure on T^{\otimes_R *+1} \otimes_B X. For a B-Galois
extension S \to T, a stable anti Yetter-Drinfel'd B-module T_S is constructed,
such that the cyclic objects B^{\otimes_R *+1} \otimes_B T_S and T^
{\hat{\otimes}_S *+1} are isomorphic. As an application, we compute Hochschild
and cyclic homology of a groupoid with coefficients, by tracing it back to the
group case. In particular, we obtain explicit expressions for ordinary
Hochschild and cyclic homology of a groupoid.
"
What is the mirror symmetry used to study the problem of counting holomorphic rational curves in a Calabi-Yau threefold X?,"  We apply mirror symmetry to the problem of counting holomorphic rational
curves in a Calabi-Yau threefold X with Z_3 x Z_3 Wilson lines. As we found in
Part A [hep-th/0703182], the integral homology group H_2(X,Z)=Z^3 + Z_3 + Z_3
contains torsion curves. Using the B-model on the mirror of X as well as its
covering spaces, we compute the instanton numbers. We observe that X is
self-mirror even at the quantum level. Using the self-mirror property, we
derive the complete prepotential on X, going beyond the results of Part A. In
particular, this yields the first example where the instanton number depends on
the torsion part of its homology class. Another consequence is that the
threefold X provides a non-toric example for the conjectured exchange of
torsion subgroups in mirror manifolds.
"
What are the implications of gene duplication for the scaling of transcription factors in procaryotes?,"  Background: Duplication of genes is important for evolution of molecular
networks. Many authors have therefore considered gene duplication as a driving
force in shaping the topology of molecular networks. In particular it has been
noted that growth via duplication would act as an implicit way of preferential
attachment, and thereby provide the observed broad degree distributions of
molecular networks.
  Results: We extend current models of gene duplication and rewiring by
including directions and the fact that molecular networks are not a result of
unidirectional growth. We introduce upstream sites and downstream shapes to
quantify potential links during duplication and rewiring. We find that this in
itself generates the observed scaling of transcription factors for genome sites
in procaryotes. The dynamical model can generate a scale-free degree
distribution, p(k)&prop; 1/k^&gamma;, with exponent &gamma;=1 in the
non-growing case, and with &gamma;>1 when the network is growing.
  Conclusions: We find that duplication of genes followed by substantial
recombination of upstream regions could generate main features of genetic
regulatory networks. Our steady state degree distribution is however to broad
to be consistent with data, thereby suggesting that selective pruning acts as a
main additional constraint on duplicated genes. Our analysis shows that gene
duplication can only be a main cause for the observed broad degree
distributions, if there is also substantial recombinations between upstream
regions of genes.
"
What is the aim of the KATRIN experiment?,"  The aim of the KArlsruhe TRItium Neutrino experiment KATRIN is the
determination of the absolute neutrino mass scale down to 0.2 eV, with
essentially smaller model dependence than from cosmology and neutrinoless
double beta decay. For this purpose, the integral electron energy spectrum is
measured close to the endpoint of molecular tritium beta decay. The endpoint,
together with the neutrino mass, should be fitted from the KATRIN data as a
free parameter. The right-handed couplings change the electron energy spectrum
close to the endpoint, therefore they have some effect also to the precise
neutrino mass determination. The statistical calculations show that, using the
endpoint as a free parameter, the unaccounted right-handed couplings
constrained by many beta decay experiments can change the fitted neutrino mass
value, relative to the true neutrino mass, by not larger than about 5-10 %.
Using, incorrectly, the endpoint as a fixed input parameter, the above change
of the neutrino mass can be much larger, order of 100 %, and for some cases it
can happen that for large true neutrino mass value the fitted neutrino mass
squared is negative. Publications using fixed endpoint and presenting large
right-handed coupling effects to the neutrino mass determination are not
relevant for the KATRIN experiment.
"
What is the relationship between semiclassical and fully quantum solutions of the time-dependent Schrödinger equation?,"  We study solutions of the time dependent Schr\""odinger equation on Riemannian
manifolds with oscillatory initial conditions given by Lagrangian states.
Semiclassical approximations describe these solutions for small h (where h is
the semiclassical parameter), but their accuracy for large times is in general
only understood up to the Ehrenfest time T ~ ln(1/h), and the most difficult
case is the one where the underlying classical system is chaotic.
  We show that on surfaces of constant negative curvature semiclassical
approximations remain accurate for times at least up to T ~ h^(-1/2) in the
case that the Lagrangian state is associated with an unstable manifold of the
geodesic flow.
"
What are the implications of defects in Pt NCs on the formation of twins?,"  We report high resolution transmission electron microscopy and ab initio
calculation results for the defect formation in Pt nanocontacts (NCs). Our
results show that there is a size limit to the existence of twins (extended
structural defects). Defects are always present but blocked away from the tip
axes. The twins may act as scattering plane, influencing contact electron
transmission for Pt NC at room temperature and Ag/Au NC at low temperature.
"
What is the topological counterpart of the explicit construction of finite CW-complexes endowed with a free action of the Artin groups?,"  The result of this paper is the determination of the cohomology of Artin
groups of type A_n, B_n and \tilde{A}_{n} with non-trivial local coefficients.
The main result is an explicit computation of the cohomology of the Artin group
of type B_n with coefficients over the module \Q[q^{\pm 1},t^{\pm 1}]. Here the
first (n-1) standard generators of the group act by (-q)-multiplication, while
the last one acts by (-t)-multiplication. The proof uses some technical results
from previous papers plus computations over a suitable spectral sequence. The
remaining cases follow from an application of Shapiro's lemma, by considering
some well-known inclusions: we obtain the rational cohomology of the Artin
group of affine type \tilde{A}_{n} as well as the cohomology of the classical
braid group {Br}_{n} with coefficients in the n-dimensional representation
presented in \cite{tong}. The topological counterpart is the explicit
construction of finite CW-complexes endowed with a free action of the Artin
groups, which are known to be K(\pi,1) spaces in some cases (including finite
type groups). Particularly simple formulas for the Euler-characteristic of
these orbit spaces are derived.
"
What is the strategy for classifying indecomposable polynomials of degree not a power of the characteristic?,"  We produce a new family of polynomials f(x) over fields K of characteristic 2
which are exceptional, in the sense that f(x)-f(y) has no absolutely
irreducible factors in K[x,y] besides the scalar multiples of x-y; when K is
finite, this condition is equivalent to saying there are infinitely many finite
extensions L/K for which the map c --> f(c) is bijective on L. Our polynomials
have degree (2^e-1)*2^(e-1), where e is odd. Combined with our previous paper
arxiv:0707.1835, this completes the classification of indecomposable
exceptional polynomials of degree not a power of the characteristic. The
strategy of our proof is to identify the curves that can arise as the Galois
closure of the branched cover P^1 --> P^1 induced by an exceptional polynomial
f. In this case, the curves turn out to be x^(q+1)+y^(q+1)=a+T(xy), where
T(z)=z^(q/2)+z^(q/4)+...+z. Our proofs rely on new properties of ramification
in Galois covers of curves, as well as the computation of the automorphism
groups of all curves in a certain 2-parameter family.
"
How do complex networks with the disassortative communicability compare to those with assortative communicability?,"  Many topological and dynamical properties of complex networks are defined by
assuming that most of the transport on the network flows along the shortest
paths. However, there are different scenarios in which non-shortest paths are
used to reach the network destination. Thus the consideration of the shortest
paths only does not account for the global communicability of a complex
network. Here we propose a new measure of the communicability of a complex
network, which is a broad generalization of the concept of the shortest path.
According to the new measure, most of real-world networks display the largest
communicability between the most connected (popular) nodes of the network
(assortative communicability). There are also several networks with the
disassortative communicability, where the most ""popular"" nodes communicate very
poorly to each other. Using this information we classify a diverse set of
real-world complex systems into a small number of universality classes based on
their structure-dynamic correlation. In addition, the new communicability
measure is able to distinguish finer structures of networks, such as
communities into which a network is divided. A community is unambiguously
defined here as a set of nodes displaying larger communicability among them
than to the rest of nodes in the network.
"
What are the conditions for the growth process to be allowed to take place in certain areas?,"  We report some basic results regarding transport in disordered
reaction-diffusion systems with birth (A->2A), death (A->0), and binary
competition (2A->A) processes. We consider a model in which the growth process
is only allowed to take place in certain areas--""oases""--while the rest of
space--the ""desert""--is hostile to growth. In the limit of low oasis density,
transport is mediated through rare ""hopping"" events, necessitating the
inclusion of discreteness effects in the model. By first considering transport
between two oases, we are able to derive an approximate expression for the
average time taken for a population to traverse a disordered medium.

What are the characteristics of the antiferromagnetic phase in PAHs?,"  Magnetism in nanographenes (also know as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, or
PAHs) are studied with first principles density functional calculations. We
find that an antiferromagnetic (AFM) phase appears as the PAH reaches a certain
size. This AFM phase in PAHs has the same origin as the one in infinitely long
zigzag-edged graphene nanoribbons, namely, from the localized electronic state
at the zigzag edge. The smallest PAH still having an AFM ground state is
identified. With increased length of the zigzag edge, PAHs approach an
infinitely long ribbon in terms of (1) the energetic ordering and difference
among the AFM, ferromagnetic (FM), and nonmagnetic (NM) phases and (2) the
average local magnetic moment at the zigzag edges. These PAHs serve as ideal
targets for chemical synthesis of nanographenes that possess magnetic
properties. Moreover, our calculations support the interpretation that
experimentally observed magnetism in activated carbon fibers originates from
the zigzag edges of the nanographenes.
"
How can a transmitter minimize the distortion of the received signal in a fading channel?,"  A transmitter without channel state information (CSI) wishes to send a
delay-limited Gaussian source over a slowly fading channel. The source is coded
in superimposed layers, with each layer successively refining the description
in the previous one. The receiver decodes the layers that are supported by the
channel realization and reconstructs the source up to a distortion. The
expected distortion is minimized by optimally allocating the transmit power
among the source layers. For two source layers, the allocation is optimal when
power is first assigned to the higher layer up to a power ceiling that depends
only on the channel fading distribution; all remaining power, if any, is
allocated to the lower layer. For convex distortion cost functions with convex
constraints, the minimization is formulated as a convex optimization problem.
In the limit of a continuum of infinite layers, the minimum expected distortion
is given by the solution to a set of linear differential equations in terms of
the density of the fading distribution. As the bandwidth ratio b (channel uses
per source symbol) tends to zero, the power distribution that minimizes
expected distortion converges to the one that maximizes expected capacity.
While expected distortion can be improved by acquiring CSI at the transmitter
(CSIT) or by increasing diversity from the realization of independent fading
paths, at high SNR the performance benefit from diversity exceeds that from
CSIT, especially when b is large.

How is the average value of the time of arrival of a particle detected by a particle detector calculated?,"  We present the very simple model of a particle detector and the proposal for
the calculation of the average value of the time of arrival.
"
How are the Jordan triple elementary surjective maps constructed?,"  We prove that Jordan triple elementary surjective maps on unital rings
containing a nontrivial idempotent are automatically additive.

"What are the characteristics of the final state of the magnetorotational collapse, including the mass of the black hole and its spin parameter?","  We perform axisymmetric simulations of the magnetorotational collapse of very
massive stars in full general relativity. Our simulations are applicable to the
collapse of supermassive stars (M > 10^3M_sun) and to very massive Pop III
stars. We model our initial configurations by n=3 polytropes. The ratio of
magnetic to rotational kinetic energy in these configurations is chosen to be
small (1% and 10%). We find that such magnetic fields do not affect the initial
collapse significantly. The core collapses to a black hole, after which black
hole excision is employed to continue the evolution long enough for the hole to
reach a quasi-stationary state. We find that the black hole mass is M_h = 0.95M
and its spin parameter is J_h/M_h^2 = 0.7, with the remaining matter forming a
torus around the black hole. We freeze the spacetime metric (""Cowling
approximation"") and continue to follow the evolution of the torus after the
black hole has relaxed to quasi-stationary equilibrium. In the absence of
magnetic fields, the torus settles down following ejection of a small amount of
matter due to shock heating. When magnetic fields are present, the field lines
gradually collimate along the hole's rotation axis. MHD shocks and the MRI
generate MHD turbulence in the torus and stochastic accretion onto the central
black hole. When the magnetic field is strong, a wind is generated in the
torus, and the torus undergoes radial oscillations that drive episodic
accretion onto the hole. These oscillations produce long-wavelength
gravitational waves potentially detectable by LISA. The final state of the
magnetorotational collapse always consists of a central black hole surrounded
by a collimated magnetic field and a hot, thick accretion torus. This system is
a viable candidate for the central engine of a long-soft gamma-ray burst.
"
What are the predictions for charmonium and open charm production in nuclear collisions at SPS/FAIR energies?,"  We provide predictions for charmonium and open charm production in nuclear
collisions at SPS/FAIR energies within the framework of the statistical
hadronization model. The increasing importance at lower energies of Lambda_c
production is demonstrated and provides a challenge for future experiments. We
also demonstrate that, because of the large charm quark mass and the different
timescales for charm quark and charmed hadron production, possible
modifications of charmed hadrons in the hot hadronic medium do not lead to
measurable changes in cross sections for D-meson production. A possible
influence of medium effects can be seen, however, in yields of charmonium.
These effects are visible at all energies and results are presented for the
energy range between charm threshold and RHIC energy.
"
What is the method to measure and localize homology classes?,"  We develop a method for measuring and localizing homology classes. This
involves two problems. First, we define relevant notions of size for both a
homology class and a homology group basis, using ideas from relative homology.
Second, we propose an algorithm to compute the optimal homology basis, using
techniques from persistent homology and finite field algebra. Classes of the
computed optimal basis are localized with cycles conveying their sizes. The
algorithm runs in $O(\beta^4 n^3 \log^2 n)$ time, where $n$ is the size of the
simplicial complex and $\beta$ is the Betti number of the homology group.
"
What is the accuracy of the standard simplified forms of the IDR?,"  The representation of the usual integral dispersion relations (IDR) of
scattering theory through series of derivatives of the amplitudes is discussed,
extended, simplified, and confirmed as mathematical identities. Forms of
derivative dispersion relations (DDR) valid for the whole energy interval,
recently obtained and presented as double infinite series, are simplified
through the use of new sum rules of the incomplete $\Gamma$ functions, being
reduced to single summations, where the usual convergence criteria are easily
applied. For the forms of the imaginary amplitude used in phenomenology of
hadronic scattering, we show that expressions for the DDR can represent, with
absolute accuracy, the IDR of scattering theory, as true mathematical
identities. Besides the fact that the algebraic manipulation can be easily
understood, numerical examples show the accuracy of these representations up to
the maximum available machine precision. As consequence of our work, it is
concluded that the standard simplified forms sDDR, originally intended for the
high energy limits, are an inconvenient and incomplete separation of terms of
the full expression, leading to wrong evaluations. Since the correspondence
between IDR and the DDR expansions is linear, our results have wide
applicability, covering more general functions, built as combinations of well
studied basic forms.
"
What is the identification of X-ray source IGR J16194-2810 as a Symbiotic X-ray Binary (SyXB)?,"  We here report on the multiwavelength study which led us to the
identification of X-ray source IGR J16194-2810 as a new Symbiotic X-ray Binary
(SyXB), that is, a rare type of Low Mass X-ray Binary (LMXB) composed of a
M-type giant and a compact object. Using the accurate X-ray position allowed by
Swift/XRT data, we pinpointed the optical counterpart, a M2 III star. Besides,
the combined use of the spectral information afforded by XRT and INTEGRAL/IBIS
shows that the 0.5-200 keV spectrum of this source can be described with an
absorbed Comptonization model, usually found in LMXBs and, in particular, in
SyXBs. No long-term (days to months) periodicities are detected in the IBIS
data. The time coverage afforded by XRT reveals shot-noise variability typical
of accreting Galactic X-ray sources, but is not good enough to explore the
presence of X-ray short-term (seconds to hours) oscillations in detail. By
using the above information, we infer important parameters for this source such
as its distance (about 3.7 kpc) and X-ray luminosity (about 1.4e35 erg/s in the
0.5-200 keV band), and we give a description for this system (typical of SyXBs)
in which a compact object (possibly a neutron star) accretes from the wind of
its M-type giant companion. We also draw some comparisons between IGR
J16194-2810 and other sources belonging to this subclass, finding that this
object resembles SyXBs 4U 1700+24 and 4U 1954+31.
"
What are the results of general relativistic simulations of stellar core collapse to a proto-neutron star?,"  We present detailed results from performing general relativistic (GR)
simulations of stellar core collapse to a proto-neutron star, using a
microphysical equation of state (EoS) as well as an approximate description of
deleptonization during the collapse phase. We show that for a wide variety of
rotation rates and profiles the gravitational wave (GW) burst signals from the
core bounce are of a generic type, already known as Type I in the literature.
In addition, for most models the characteristic frequency of the GW burst
signal lies in a narrow range around approximately 718 Hz. In our systematic
study, using both GR and Newtonian gravity, we identify, individually quantify,
and discuss in detail the micro- and macrophysical mechanisms leading to this
result, i.e. the effects of rotation, the EoS, and deleptonization. We also
discuss the detectability prospects of such GW burst signals by GW detectors,
and infer that such a generic type of signal templates will likely facilitate a
more efficient search in current and future detectors of both interferometric
and resonant type.
"
How does the surface density and velocity of satellites around normal galaxies compare to the predictions of the standard cosmological model?,"  The motion of satellite galaxies around normal galaxies at distances 50-500
kpc provides a sensitive test for the theories. We study the surface density
and the velocities of satellites around isolated galaxies in the Sloan Digital
Sky Survey. We find that the surface number-density of satellites declines with
the projected distance as a power law with the slope -1.5-2. The rms velocities
gradually decline: observations exclude constant velocities at a 10 sigma
level. We show that observational data strongly favor the standard model: all
three major statistics of satellites - the number-density profile, the
line-of-sight velocity dispersion, and the distribution function of the
velocities -- agree remarkably well with the predictions of the standard
cosmological model. Thus, that the success of the standard model extends to
scales (50-500) kpc, much lower than what was previously considered. MOND fails
on these scales for models which assume any single power-law number-density
profile of satellites and any constant velocity anisotropy by predicting nearly
constant rms velocities of satellites. Satellite data can be fit by fine-tuned
models, which require (1) specific non-power-law density profile, (2) very
radial orbits at large distances (velocity anisotropy beta =0.6-0.7 at 200-300
kpc), and (3) 2-2.5 times more stellar mass than what is found in the galaxies.
The external gravity force - a necessary component for MOND -- makes the
situation even worse. We argue that a combination of satellite data and
observational constraints on stellar masses make these models very problematic.
"
What are the implications of the low intrinsic spin-orbit interaction and low hyperfine interaction for the realization of spin qubits in graphene?,"  The specific band structure of graphene, with its unique valley structure and
Dirac neutrality point separating hole states from electron states has led to
the observation of new electronic transport phenomena such as anomalously
quantized Hall effects, absence of weak localization and the existence of a
minimum conductivity. In addition to dissipative transport also supercurrent
transport has already been observed. It has also been suggested that graphene
might be a promising material for spintronics and related applications, such as
the realization of spin qubits, due to the low intrinsic spin orbit
interaction, as well as the low hyperfine interaction of the electron spins
with the carbon nuclei. As a first step in the direction of graphene
spintronics and spin qubits we report the observation of spin transport, as
well as Larmor spin precession over micrometer long distances using single
graphene layer based field effect transistors. The non-local spin valve
geometry was used, employing four terminal contact geometries with
ferromagnetic cobalt electrodes, which make contact to the graphene sheet
through a thin oxide layer. We observe clear bipolar (changing from positive to
negative sign) spin signals which reflect the magnetization direction of all 4
electrodes, indicating that spin coherence extends underneath all 4 contacts.
No significant changes in the spin signals occur between 4.2K, 77K and room
temperature. From Hanle type spin precession measurements we extract a spin
relaxation length between 1.5 and 2 micron at room temperature, only weakly
dependent on charge density, which is varied from n~0 at the Dirac neutrality
point to n = 3.6 10^16/m^2. The spin polarization of the ferromagnetic contacts
is calculated from the measurements to be around 10%.
"
What is the relationship between the bulk and boundary theory viewpoints on localized tachyons on AdS orbifolds?,"  We study the condensation of localized closed string tachyons on AdS
orbifolds both from the bulk and boundary theory viewpoints. We first extend
the known results for AdS_5/Z_k to AdS_3/Z_k case, and we proposed that the
AdS_3/Z_k decays into AdS_3/Z_k' with k' < k. From the bulk viewpoint, we
obtain a time-dependent gravity solution describing the decay of AdS orbifold
numerically. From the dual gauge theory viewpoint, we calculated the Casimir
energies of gauge theory vacua and it is found that their values are exactly
the same as the masses of dual geometries, even though they are in different
parameter regimes of 't Hooft coupling. We also consider AdS_5 orbifold. The
decay of AdS_5/Z_k is dual to the transition between the dual gauge theory
vacua on R_t x S^3/Z_k, parametrized by different holonomies along the
orbifolded spatial cycle. We constructed the instanton solutions describing the
transitions by making use of instanton solutions on R_t x S^2.
"
What is the differential equation that can be reduced to a logistic differential equation?,"  We observe that the elementary logistic differential equation dP/dt=(1-P/M)kP
may be solved by first changing the variable to R=(M-P)/P. This reduces the
logistic differential equation to the simple linear differential equation
dR/dt=-kR, which can be solved without using the customary but slightly more
elaborate methods applied to the original logistic DE. The resulting solution
in terms of R can be converted by simple algebra to the familiar sigmoid
expression involving P. A biological argument is given for introducing logistic
growth via the simpler DE for R. It is also shown that the sigmoid P may be
written in terms of the hyperbolic tangent by a simple translation that is also
motivated by a biological argument.
"
What is the ground state phase transition in a Kondo lattice model in a two-dimensional square lattice?,"  Motivated by recent Hall-effect experiment in YbRh$_2$Si$_2$, we study ground
state properties of a Kondo lattice model in a two-dimensional square lattice
using variational Monte Carlo method. We show that there are two types of phase
transition, antiferromagnetic transition and topological one (Fermi surface
reconstruction). In a wide region of parameters, these two transitions occur
simultaneously without the breakdown of Kondo screening, accompanied by a
discontinuous change of the Hall coefficient. This result is consistent with
the experiment and gives a novel theoretical picture for the quantum critical
point in heavy fermion systems.
"
What are the predictions and possible theoretical tests of the negative matter?,"  First, dark matter is introduced. Next, the Dirac negative energy state is
rediscussed. It is a negative matter with some new characteristics, which are
mainly the gravitation each other, but the repulsion with all positive matter.
Such the positive and negative matters are two regions of topological
separation in general case, and the negative matter is invisible. It is the
simplest candidate of dark matter, and can explain some characteristics of the
dark matter and dark energy. Recent phantom on dark energy is namely a negative
matter. We propose that in quantum fluctuations the positive matter and
negative matter are created at the same time, and derive an inflation cosmos,
which is created from nothing. The Higgs mechanism is possibly a product of
positive and negative matter. Based on a basic axiom and the two foundational
principles of the negative matter, we research its predictions and possible
theoretical tests, in particular, the season effect. The negative matter should
be a necessary development of Dirac theory. Finally, we propose the three basic
laws of the negative matter. The existence of four matters on positive,
opposite, and negative, negative-opposite particles will form the most perfect
symmetrical world.
"
What are the three types of spatial alignments observed in the cosmological N-body simulation of satellite halos within a group?,"  Based on a cosmological N-body simulation we analyze spatial and kinematic
alignments of satellite halos within six times the virial radius of group size
host halos (Rvir). We measure three different types of spatial alignment: halo
alignment between the orientation of the group central substructure (GCS) and
the distribution of its satellites, radial alignment between the orientation of
a satellite and the direction towards its GCS, and direct alignment between the
orientation of the GCS and that of its satellites. In analogy we use the
directions of satellite velocities and probe three further types of alignment:
the radial velocity alignment between the satellite velocity and connecting
line between satellite and GCS, the halo velocity alignment between the
orientation of the GCS and satellite velocities and the auto velocity alignment
between the satellites orientations and their velocities. We find that
satellites are preferentially located along the major axis of the GCS within at
least 6 Rvir (the range probed here). Furthermore, satellites preferentially
point towards the GCS. The most pronounced signal is detected on small scales
but a detectable signal extends out to 6 Rvir. The direct alignment signal is
weaker, however a systematic trend is visible at distances < 2 Rvir. All
velocity alignments are highly significant on small scales. Our results suggest
that the halo alignment reflects the filamentary large scale structure which
extends far beyond the virial radii of the groups. In contrast, the main
contribution to the radial alignment arises from the adjustment of the
satellite orientations in the group tidal field. The projected data reveal good
agreement with recent results derived from large galaxy surveys. (abridged)
"
What are the lower limits to the bolometric luminosity and energetics of the black-body component in GRB 060218?,"  If the early optical data of GRB 060218 up to 1e5 s are interpreted as the
black-body flux associated with the supernova shock breakout, we can derive
lower limits to the bolometric luminosity and energetics of this black-body
component. These limits are more severe for the very early data that imply
energetics of order of 1e51 erg. These values, puzzlingly large, are rather
independent of the assumed time profile of the emitting surface, provided that
the corresponding radius does not increase superluminally. Another concern is
the luminosity of the black-body component observed in the X-rays, that is
large and appears to be produced by an approximately constant temperature and a
surface area increasing only slowly in time. Although it has been suggested
that the long X-ray black-body duration is consistent with the supernova shock
breakout if anisotropy is assumed, the nearly constant emitting surface
requires some fine tuning, allowing and suggesting an alternative
interpretation, i.e. emission from late dissipation of the fireball bulk
kinetic energy. This in turn requires a small value of the bulk Lorentz factor.
"
What are the advantages of the hierarchical model with hidden Markovian variables?,"  Hyperspectral images can be represented either as a set of images or as a set
of spectra. Spectral classification and segmentation and data reduction are the
main problems in hyperspectral image analysis. In this paper we propose a
Bayesian estimation approach with an appropriate hiearchical model with hidden
markovian variables which gives the possibility to jointly do data reduction,
spectral classification and image segmentation. In the proposed model, the
desired independent components are piecewise homogeneous images which share the
same common hidden segmentation variable. Thus, the joint Bayesian estimation
of this hidden variable as well as the sources and the mixing matrix of the
source separation problem gives a solution for all the three problems of
dimensionality reduction, spectra classification and segmentation of
hyperspectral images. A few simulation results illustrate the performances of
the proposed method compared to other classical methods usually used in
hyperspectral image processing.
"
What is the microstate of the black ring in four and five dimensional language?,"  We present a sample microstate for a black ring in four and five dimensional
language. The microstate consists of a black string microstate with an
additional D6-brane. We show that with an appropriate choice of parameters the
piece involving the black string microstate falls down a long AdS throat, whose
M-theory lift is AdS_3 X S^2. We wrap a spinning dipole M2-brane on the S^2 in
the probe approximation. In IIA, this corresponds to a dielectric D2-brane
carrying only D0-charge. We conjecture this is the first approximation to a
cloud of D0-branes blowing up due to their non-abelian degrees of freedom and
the Myers effect.
"
What is the mean velocity of the E/S0 population in the Norma cluster?,"  A detailed dynamical analysis of the nearby rich Norma cluster (ACO 3627) is
presented. From radial velocities of 296 cluster members, we find a mean
velocity of 4871 +/- 54 km/s and a velocity dispersion of 925 km/s. The mean
velocity of the E/S0 population (4979 +/- 85 km/s) is offset with respect to
that of the S/Irr population (4812 +/- 70 km/s) by `Delta' v = 164 km/s in the
cluster rest frame. This offset increases towards the core of the cluster. The
E/S0 population is free of any detectable substructure and appears relaxed. Its
shape is clearly elongated with a position angle that is aligned along the
dominant large-scale structures in this region, the so-called Norma wall. The
central cD galaxy has a very large peculiar velocity of 561 km/s which is most
probably related to an ongoing merger at the core of the cluster. The
spiral/irregular galaxies reveal a large amount of substructure; two
dynamically distinct subgroups within the overall spiral-population have been
identified, located along the Norma wall elongation. The dynamical mass of the
Norma cluster within its Abell radius is 1 - 1.1 x 10^15 h^-1_73 M_Sun. One of
the cluster members, the spiral galaxy WKK 6176 which recently was observed to
have a 70 kpc X-ray tail, reveals numerous striking low-brightness filaments
pointing away from the cluster centre suggesting strong interaction with the
intracluster medium.
"
How does the Wronskian matrix E(ϕ) relate to the parameter-dependence of the matrix U(ϕ)?,"  In this article we review the observation, due originally to Dwork, that the
zeta-function of an arithmetic variety, defined originally over the field with
p elements, is a superdeterminant. We review this observation in the context of
a one parameter family of quintic threefolds, and study the zeta-function as a
function of the parameter \phi. Owing to cancellations, the superdeterminant of
an infinite matrix reduces to the (ordinary) determinant of a finite matrix,
U(\phi), corresponding to the action of the Frobenius map on certain cohomology
groups. The parameter-dependence of U(\phi) is given by a relation
U(\phi)=E^{-1}(\phi^p)U(0)E(\phi) with E(\phi) a Wronskian matrix formed from
the periods of the manifold. The periods are defined by series that converge
for $|\phi|_p < 1$. The values of \phi that are of interest are those for which
\phi^p = \phi so, for nonzero \phi, we have |\vph|_p=1. We explain how the
process of p-adic analytic continuation applies to this case. The matrix
U(\phi) breaks up into submatrices of rank 4 and rank 2 and we are able from
this perspective to explain some of the observations that have been made
previously by numerical calculation.
"
msson patterns?,"  Not long ago, Claesson and Mansour proposed some conjectures about the
enumeration of the permutations avoiding more than three Babson - Steingr\'\i
msson patterns (generalized patterns of type $(1,2)$ or $(2,1)$). The avoidance
of one, two or three patterns has already been considered. Here, the cases of
four and five forbidden patterns are solved and the exact enumeration of the
permutations avoiding them is given, confirming the conjectures of Claesson and
Mansour. The approach we use can be easily extended to the cases of more than
five forbidden patterns.
"
What are the possible behaviors of the point process under the stationary measure as n tends to infinity?,"  Consider a time-varying collection of n points on the positive real axis,
modeled as exponentials of n Brownian motions whose drift vector at every time
point is determined by the relative ranks of the coordinate processes at that
time. If at each time point we divide the points by their sum, under suitable
assumptions the rescaled point process converges to a stationary distribution
(depending on n and the vector of drifts) as time goes to infinity. This
stationary distribution can be exactly computed using a recent result of Pal
and Pitman. The model and the rescaled point process are both central objects
of study in models of equity markets introduced by Banner, Fernholz, and
Karatzas. In this paper, we look at the behavior of this point process under
the stationary measure as $n$ tends to infinity. Under a certain `continuity at
the edge' condition on the drifts, we show that one of the following must
happen: either (i) all points converge to zero, or (ii) the maximum goes to one
and the rest go to zero, or (iii) the processes converge in law to a
non-trivial Poisson-Dirichlet distribution. The proof employs, among other
things, techniques from Talagrand's analysis of the low temperature phase of
Derrida's Random Energy Model of spin glasses. The main result establishes a
universality property for the BFK models and aids in explicit asymptotic
computations using known results about the Poisson-Dirichlet law.
"
How does oxygen doping affect the anisotropy and disorder in the glass transition of vortices in Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+δ?,"  We study the oxygen doping dependence of the equilibrium first-order melting
and second-order glass transitions of vortices in
Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\delta}$. Doping affects both anisotropy and
disorder. Anisotropy scaling is shown to collapse the melting lines only where
thermal fluctuations are dominant. Yet, in the region where disorder breaks
that scaling, the glass lines are still collapsed. A quantitative fit to
melting and replica symmetry breaking lines of a 2D Ginzburg-Landau model
further reveals that disorder amplitude weakens with doping, but to a lesser
degree than thermal fluctuations, enhancing the relative role of disorder.
"
"What are the main findings regarding the relationship between the angular sizes, core radii, and limiting radii of the observed open clusters?","  We present results of a photometric survey whose aim was to derive structural
and astrophysical parameters for 42 open clusters. While our sample is
definitively not representative of the total open cluster sample in the Galaxy,
it does cover a wide range of cluster parameters and is uniform enough to allow
for simple statistical considerations. BV wide-field CCD photometry was
obtained for open clusters for which photometric, structural, and dynamical
evolution parameters were determined. The limiting and core radii were
determined by analyzing radial density profiles. The ages, reddenings, and
distances were obtained from the solar metallicity isochrone fitting. The mass
function was used to study the dynamical state of the systems, mass segregation
effect and to estimate the total mass and number of cluster members. This study
reports on the first determination of basic parameters for 11 out of 42
observed open clusters. The angular sizes for the majority of the observed
clusters appear to be several times larger than the catalogue data indicate.
The core and limiting cluster radii are correlated and the latter parameter is
3.2 times larger on average. The limiting radius increases with the cluster's
mass, and both the limiting and core radii decrease in the course of dynamical
evolution. For dynamically not advanced clusters, the mass function slope is
similar to the universal IMF slope. For more evolved systems, the effect of
evaporation of low-mass members is clearly visible. The initial mass
segregation is present in all the observed young clusters, whereas the
dynamical mass segregation appears in clusters older than about log(age)=8.
Low-mass stars are deficient in the cores of clusters older than log(age)=8.5
and not younger than one relaxation time.
"
"What is the result of the cohomological induction for a pair (g, k)?","  We study cohomological induction for a pair $(\frak g,\frak k)$, $\frak g$
being an infinite dimensional locally reductive Lie algebra and $\frak k
\subset\frak g$ being of the form $\frak k_0 + C_\gg(\frak k_0)$, where $\frak
k_0\subset\frak g$ is a finite dimensional reductive in $\frak g$ subalgebra
and $C_{\gg} (\frak k_0)$ is the centralizer of $\frak k_0$ in $\frak g$. We
prove a general non-vanishing and $\frak k$-finiteness theorem for the output.
This yields in particular simple $(\frak g,\frak k)$-modules of finite type
over $\frak k$ which are analogs of the fundamental series of generalized
Harish-Chandra modules constructed in \cite{PZ1} and \cite{PZ2}. We study
explicit versions of the construction when $\frak g$ is a root-reductive or
diagonal locally simple Lie algebra.
"
What is the role of galaxy mergers in the origin of the relationship between supermassive black hole masses and galaxy stellar bulge masses?,"  Supermassive black hole (BH) masses (MBH) are strongly correlated with galaxy
stellar bulge masses (Mbulge) and there are several ideas to explain the origin
of this relationship. This study isolates the role of galaxy mergers from
considerations of other detailed physics to more clearly show how a linear
BH-galaxy mass relation (MBH-Mgal) can naturally emerge regardless of how
primordial BHs were seeded inside galaxies, if the galaxy mass function
declines with increasing mass. Under this circumstance, the MBH-Mgal relation
is a passive attractor that eventually converges to a tight linear relation
because of two basic statistical effects: a central limit-like tendency for
galaxy mergers which is much stronger for major mergers than minor mergers, and
a convergence toward a linear relation that is due mainly to minor mergers. A
curious consequence of this thought experiment is that, if galaxy bulges are
formed by major mergers, then merging statistics naturally show that MBH would
correlate more strongly with bulge dominated galaxies, because of stronger
central-seeking tendencies, than with disk dominated galaxies. Even if some
other physics is ultimately responsible for causing a linear MBH-Mbulge
relationship, this thought experiment shows that, counter to intuition, random
merging of galaxies that harbor random BH masses tends to strengthen rather
than weaken a pre-existing, linear, correlation. This idea may be generalized
to other gravitationally bound systems (dark matter halo, compact nuclear
objects) that retain their physical identities after experiencing mergers.
"
What is the effect of the cross-linear (TE-TM or TM-TE) configuration on the parametric amplification of polaritons in semiconductor microcavities?,"  Based on a microscopic many-particle theory we investigate the influence of
excitonic correlations on the vectorial polarization state characteristics of
the parametric amplification of polaritons in semiconductor microcavities. We
study a microcavity with perfect in-plane isotropy. A linear stability analysis
of the cavity polariton dynamics shows that in the co-linear (TE-TE or TM-TM)
pump-probe polarization state configuration, excitonic correlations diminish
the parametric scattering process whereas it is enhanced by excitonic
correlations in the cross-linear (TE-TM or TM-TE) configuration. Without any
free parameters, our microscopic theory gives a quantitative understanding how
many-particle effects can lead to a rotation or change of the outgoing
(amplified) probe signal's vectorial polarization state relative to the
incoming one's.
"
What is the role of Ga 3d states in determining the properties of bulk as well as nanoparticles of GaN?,"  We have studied the role of Ga 3d states in determining the properties of
bulk as well as nanoparticles of GaN using PAW potentials. A significant
contribution of the Ga d states in the valence band is found to arise from the
interaction of Ga 4d states with the dominantly N p states making up the
valence band. The errors arising from not treating the Ga 3d states as a part
of the valence are found to be similar, ~ 1%, for bulk as well as for

What are the orbital periods of the planets detected around high metallicity stars?,"  We report the detection of five Jovian mass planets orbiting high metallicity
stars. Four of these stars were first observed as part of the N2K program and
exhibited low RMS velocity scatter after three consecutive observations.
However, follow-up observations over the last three years now reveal the
presence of longer period planets with orbital periods ranging from 21 days to
a few years. HD 11506 is a G0V star with a planet of \msini = 4.74 \mjup in a
3.85 year orbit. HD 17156 is a G0V star with a 3.12 \mjup planet in a 21.2 day
orbit. The eccentricity of this orbit is 0.67, one of the highest known for a
planet with a relatively short period. The orbital period for this planet
places it in a region of parameter space where relatively few planets have been
detected. HD 125612 is a G3V star with a planet of \msini = 3.5 \mjup in a 1.4
year orbit. HD 170469 is a G5IV star with a planet of \msini = 0.67 \mjup in a
3.13 year orbit. HD 231701 is an F8V star with planet of 1.08 \mjup in a 142
day orbit. All of these stars have supersolar metallicity. Three of the five
stars were observed photometrically but showed no evidence of brightness
variability. A transit search conducted for HD 17156 was negative but covered
only 25% of the search space and so is not conclusive.
"
What is the Object Clustering Benchmark used to evaluate the performances of clustering policies?,"  We present in this paper a generic object-oriented benchmark (the Object
Clustering Benchmark) that has been designed to evaluate the performances of
clustering policies in object-oriented databases. OCB is generic because its
sample database may be customized to fit the databases introduced by the main
existing benchmarks (e.g., OO1). OCB's current form is clustering-oriented
because of its clustering-oriented workload, but it can be easily adapted to
other purposes. Lastly, OCB's code is compact and easily portable. OCB has been
implemented in a real system (Texas, running on a Sun workstation), in order to
test a specific clustering policy called DSTC. A few results concerning this
test are presented.
"
How do the optical spectroscopy results characterize the nature of the detected sources?,"  The Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) is performing a high Galactic latitude
survey in the 14-195 keV band at a flux limit of ~10^{-11} erg cm^{-2} s^{-1},
leading to the discovery of new high energy sources, most of which have not so
far been properly classified. A similar work has also been performed with the
RXTE slew survey leading to the discovery of 68 sources detected above 8 keV,
many of which are still unclassified. Follow-up observations with the Swift
X-ray Telescope (XRT) provide, for many of these objects, source localization
with a positional accuracy of few arcsec, thus allowing the search for optical
counterparts to be more efficient and reliable. We present the results of
optical/X-ray follow-up studies of 11 Swift BAT detections and one AGN detected
in the RXTE Slew Survey, aimed at identifying their counterparts and at
assessing their nature. These data allowed, for the first time, the optical
classification of 8 objects and a distance determination for 3 of them. For
another object, a more refined optical classification than that available in
the literature is also provided. For the remaining sources, optical
spectroscopy provides a characterization of the source near in time to the
X-ray measurement. The sample consists of 6 Seyfert 2 galaxies, 5 Seyferts of
intermediate type 1.2-1.8, and one object of Galactic nature - an Intermediate
Polar (i.e., magnetic) Cataclysmic Variable. Out of the 11 AGNs, 8 (~70%)
including 2 Seyferts of type 1.2 and 1.5, are absorbed with NH > 10^{22}
cm^{-2}. Up to 3 objects could be Compton thick (i.e. NH > 1.5 x 10^{24}
cm^{-2}), but only in one case (Swift J0609.1-8636) does all the observational
evidence strongly suggests this possibility.
"
What is the model-checking tool used to analyze quantum information protocols?,"  We introduce a model-checking tool intended specially for the analysis of
quantum information protocols. The tool incorporates an efficient
representation of a certain class of quantum circuits, namely those expressible
in the so-called stabiliser formalism. Models of protocols are described using
a simple, imperative style simulation language which includes commands for the
unitary operators in the Clifford group as well as classical integer and
boolean variables. Formulas for verification are expressed using a subset of
quantum computational tree logic (QCTL). The model-checking procedure treats
quantum measurements as the source of non-determinism, leading to multiple
protocol runs, one for each outcome. Verification is performed for each run.
"
What is the revised Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof GGA for generalized gradient approximations?,"  Successful modern generalized gradient approximations (GGA) are biased toward
atomic energies. Restoration of the first-principles gradient expansion for the
exchange energy over a wide range of density gradients eliminates this bias. We
introduce PBEsol, a revised Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof GGA that improves
equilibrium properties for many densely-packed solids and their surfaces.
"
What is the nature of the cosmological constant problem in modern physics?,"  Special relativity is no longer a new revolutionary theory but a firmly
established cornerstone of modern physics. The teaching of special relativity,
however, still follows its presentation as it unfolded historically, trying to
convince the audience of this teaching that Newtonian physics is natural but
incorrect and special relativity is its paradoxical but correct amendment. I
argue in this article in favor of logical instead of historical trend in
teaching of relativity and that special relativity is neither paradoxical nor
correct (in the absolute sense of the nineteenth century) but the most natural
and expected description of the real space-time around us valid for all
practical purposes. This last circumstance constitutes a profound mystery of
modern physics better known as the cosmological constant problem.
"
What is the relationship between the Holographic Principle and the Hubble constant?,"  When Fischler and Susskind proposed a holographic prescription based on the
Particle Horizon, they found that spatially closed cosmological models do not
verify it due to the apparently unavoidable recontraction of the Particle
Horizon area. In this article, after a short review of their original work, we
expose graphically and analytically that spatially closed cosmological models
can avoid this problem if they expand fast enough. It has been also shown that
the Holographic Principle is saturated for a codimension one brane dominated
Universe. The Fischler-Susskind prescription is used to obtain the maximum
number of degrees of freedom per Planck volume at the Planck era compatible
with the Holographic Principle.
"
What is the difference in the RF spectroscopy between the BCS and BEC sides?,"  We theoretically investigate the ground state of trapped neutral fermions
with population imbalance in the BCS-BEC crossover regime. On the basis of the
single-channel Hamiltonian, we perform full numerical calculations of the
Bogoliubov-de Gennes equation coupled with the regularized gap and number
equations. The zero-temperature phase diagram in the crossover regime is
presented, where the Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) pairing state
governs the weak-coupling BCS region of a resonance. It is found that the FFLO
oscillation vanishes in the BEC side, in which the system under population
imbalance turns into a phase separation (PS) between locally binding superfluid
and fully polarized spin domains. We also demonstrate numerical calculations
with a large particle number O(10^5), comparable to that observed in recent
experiments. The resulting density profile on a resonance yields the PS, which
is in good agreement with the recent experiments, while the FFLO modulation
exists in the pairing field. It is also proposed that the most favorable
location for the detection of the FFLO oscillation is in the vicinity of the
critical population imbalance in the weak coupling BCS regime, where the
oscillation periodicity becomes much larger than the interparticle spacing.
Finally, we analyze the radio-frequency (RF) spectroscopy in the imbalanced
system. The clear difference in the RF spectroscopy between BCS and BEC sides
reveals the structure of the pairing field and local ``magnetization''.
"
How can the helium abundance in intracluster plasma affect the accuracy of cosmological tests based on X-ray derived cluster quantities?,"  It has long been suggested that helium nuclei in the intracluster plasma can
sediment in the cluster gravitational potential well. Some theoretical
estimates for the cores of relaxed clusters predict an excess of helium
abundance by up to a factor of a few over its primordial value. The
intracluster helium abundance cannot be measured directly. This presents a
significant source of uncertainty for cosmological tests based on the X-ray
derived cluster quantities, such as the gas mass, total mass, and gas mass
fraction, all of which depend on the assumed helium abundance. We point out
that cluster distances derived by combining the Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) and
X-ray data also depend on the helium abundance. This dependence can be used to
measure the abundance, provided the distance is known independently. For
example, if one adopts the WMAP H_0 value, then the recent H_0 measurement by
Bonamente and collaborators, derived from SZ data on 38 clusters assuming a
primordial helium abundance, corresponds to an abundance excess by a factor of
1.9+-0.8 within r~1 Mpc (using only their statistical errors). This shows that
interesting accuracy is within reach. We also briefly discuss how the SZ and
X-ray cluster data can be combined to resolve the helium abundance dependence
for the d_a(z) cosmological test.
"
What is the novel scaling solution in Friedmann cosmologies in which the massive moduli oscillate but maintain a constant energy density relative to the background barotropic fluid?,"  We consider the cosmological role of the scalar fields generated by the
compactification of 11-dimensional Einstein gravity on a 7D elliptic twisted
torus, which has the attractive features of giving rise to a positive
semi-definite potential, and partially fixing the moduli. This compactification
is therefore relevant for low energy M-theory, 11D supergravity. We find that
slow-roll inflation with the moduli is not possible, but that there is a novel
scaling solution in Friedmann cosmologies in which the massive moduli oscillate
but maintain a constant energy density relative to the background barotropic
fluid.
"
What are the systems studied using the diffusion Monte Carlo method to calculate the ground state energies of various atoms and molecules?,"  In an attempt to bypass the sign problem in quantum Monte Carlo simulation of
electronic systems within the framework of fixed node approach, we derive the
exclusion principle ""Two electrons can't be at the same external isopotential
surface simultaneously"" using the first postulate of quantum mechanics. We
propose the exact Coulomb-Exchange nodal surface i.e. the exact boundary
condition to solve the non-relativistic Schrodinger equation for the
non-degenerate ground state of atoms and molecules. This boundary condition was
applied to compute the ground state energies of N, Ne, Li2, Be2, B2, C2, N2,
O2, F2, and H2O systems using diffusion Monte Carlo method. The ground state
energies thus obtained agree well with the exact estimate of non-relativistic
energies.
"
What are the implications of the results of the study for the dynamics of the solar system?,"  We study the relative motion of nearby free test particles in cosmological
spacetimes, such as the FLRW and LTB models. In particular, the influence of
spatial inhomogeneities on local tidal accelerations is investigated. The
implications of our results for the dynamics of the solar system are briefly
discussed. That is, on the basis of the models studied in this paper, we
estimate the tidal influence of the cosmic gravitational field on the orbit of
the Earth around the Sun and show that the corresponding temporal rate of
variation of the astronomical unit is negligibly small.
"
What are the implications of the dilaton for the curvature singularity in Loop Quantum Cosmology?,"  We consider a phenomenological modification of the Pre Big Bang scenario
using ideas from the resolution of curvature singularities in Loop Quantum
Cosmology. We show that non-perturbative Loop modifications to the dynamics,
arising from the underlying polymer representation, can resolve the graceful
exit problem. The curvature and the dilaton energy stay finite at all times, in
both the string and Einstein frames. In the string frame, the dilaton tends to
a constant value at late times after the bounce.
"
What is the application of superconducting qubits to quantum optics?,"  Laser cooling of the atomic motion paved the way for remarkable achievements
in the fields of quantum optics and atomic physics, including Bose-Einstein
condensation and the trapping of atoms in optical lattices. More recently
superconducting qubits were shown to act as artificial two-level atoms,
displaying Rabi oscillations, Ramsey fringes, and further quantum effects.
Coupling such qubits to resonators brought the superconducting circuits into
the realm of quantum electrodynamics (circuit QED). It opened the perspective
to use superconducting qubits as micro-coolers or to create a population
inversion in the qubit to induce lasing behavior of the resonator. Furthering
these analogies between quantum optical and superconducting systems we
demonstrate here Sisyphus cooling of a low frequency LC oscillator coupled to a
near-resonantly driven superconducting qubit. In the quantum optics setup the
mechanical degrees of freedom of an atom are cooled by laser driving the atom's
electronic degrees of freedom. Here the roles of the two degrees of freedom are
played by the LC circuit and the qubit's levels, respectively. We also
demonstrate the counterpart of the Sisyphus cooling, namely Sisyphus
amplification. Parallel to the experimental demonstration we analyze the system
theoretically and find quantitative agreement, which supports the
interpretation and allows us to estimate system parameters.

"
What is the shape of the template that the SNR is proportional to?,"  We calculate the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the stochastic
gravitational-wave background in an extreme case that its spectrum has a sharp
falloff with its amplitude close to the detection threshold. Such a spectral
feature is a characteristic imprint of the change in the number of relativistic
degrees of freedom on the stochastic background generated during inflation in
the early Universe. We find that, although SNR is maximal with the correct
template which is proportional to the assumed real spectrum, its sensitivity to
the shape of template is fairly weak indicating that a simple power-law
template is sufficient to detect the signature.
"
What are the form factors used to calculate the upper bound of the B-meson decay?,"  Flavour Changing Neutral Current decays of the $B$-meson are a very useful
tool for studying possible physics scenarios beyond the Standard Model (SM),
where of the many FCNC modes radiative, purely leptonic and semi-leptonic
decays of the $B$-meson are relatively clean tests. Within this context the
BELLE collaboration has searched for the $B \to K_1(1270) \gamma$ process and
provided an upper bound on this decay. In this work we have used this upper
bound in studying the angular coorelations for the related semi-leptonic decay
mode $B \to K_1(1270) (\to \rho K) \ell^+ \ell^-$, where we have used the form
factors that have already been estimated for the $B \to K_1(1270) \gamma$ mode.
Note that the additional form factors that are required were calculated using
the Large Energy Effective Theory (LEET).
"
What are the implications of rapid transmission within clusters of contacts on the mean generation interval in an epidemic?,"  The generation interval is the time between the infection time of an infected
person and the infection time of his or her infector. Probability density
functions for generation intervals have been an important input for epidemic
models and epidemic data analysis. In this paper, we specify a general
stochastic SIR epidemic model and prove that the mean generation interval
decreases when susceptible persons are at risk of infectious contact from
multiple sources. The intuition behind this is that when a susceptible person
has multiple potential infectors, there is a ``race'' to infect him or her in
which only the first infectious contact leads to infection. In an epidemic, the
mean generation interval contracts as the prevalence of infection increases. We
call this global competition among potential infectors. When there is rapid
transmission within clusters of contacts, generation interval contraction can
be caused by a high local prevalence of infection even when the global
prevalence is low. We call this local competition among potential infectors.
Using simulations, we illustrate both types of competition.
  Finally, we show that hazards of infectious contact can be used instead of
generation intervals to estimate the time course of the effective reproductive
number in an epidemic. This approach leads naturally to partial likelihoods for
epidemic data that are very similar to those that arise in survival analysis,
opening a promising avenue of methodological research in infectious disease
epidemiology.
"
What are the thermal conduction paths in a nanofluid with strong cluster-fluid attraction?,"  In a well-dispersed nanofluid with strong cluster-fluid attraction, thermal
conduction paths can arise through percolating amorphous-like interfacial
structures. This results in a thermal conductivity enhancement beyond the
Maxwell limit of 3*phi, with phi being the nanoparticle volume fraction. Our
findings from non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations, which are
amenable to experimental verification, can provide a theoretical basis for the
development of future nanofluids.
"
What are the key elements of the mean field approach and its relation to the physical interpretation of spin glasses?,"  In these lectures I will review some theoretical results that have been
obtained for spin glasses. I will concentrate my attention on the formulation
of the mean field approach and on its numerical and experimental verifications.
I will present the various hypothesis at the basis of the theory and I will
discuss their mathematical and physical status.
"
What are the differences in the scaling of heavy-light mesons in the model involving quarks of different masses?,"  In the context of gauge/gravity duals with flavor, we examine heavy-light
mesons which involve a heavy and a light quark. For this purpose we embed two
D7 brane probes at different positions into the gravity background. We
establish the non-Abelian Dirac-Born-Infeld (DBI) action for these probes, in
which the U(2) matrix describing the embedding is diagonal. The fluctuations of
the brane probes correspond to the mesons. In particular, the off-diagonal
elements of the U(2) fluctuation matrix correspond to the heavy-light mesons,
while the diagonal elements correspond to the light-light and heavy-heavy
mesons, respectively. The heavy-light mesons scale differently with the 't
Hooft coupling than the mesons involving quarks of equal mass. The model
describes both scalar and vector mesons. For different dilaton-deformed gravity
backgrounds, we also calculate the Wilson loop energy, and compare with the
meson masses.
"
How the rate constant of the radiative association of carbon atoms with electrons behaves like the formation rate constant of the H- formation rate constant of the radiative association of carbon atoms with electrons?,"  In the present paper the problem of the radiative association of atoms of
carbon C with electrons $e^{-}$ for kinetic temperatures $T_{c}$ of $100 <
T_{c} < 3000$ K is considered. The calculation of the rate rate constant of the
radiative associations is made with principle of detailed balance. It is shown
that the rate has correct behavior (it increase with the temperature) and its
behavior is look-like that for the $H^{-}$ formation rate coefficient, which
also increase with the temperature.
"
What is the MacWilliams identity for linear codes with the rank metric?,"  The MacWilliams identity, which relates the weight distribution of a code to
the weight distribution of its dual code, is useful in determining the weight
distribution of codes. In this paper, we derive the MacWilliams identity for
linear codes with the rank metric, and our identity has a different form than
that by Delsarte. Using our MacWilliams identity, we also derive related
identities for rank metric codes. These identities parallel the binomial and
power moment identities derived for codes with the Hamming metric.
"
"What is the impact of the Pb$(n,n'\gamma$) and Ge$(n,n'\gamma$) reactions on the sensitivity of next-generation searches for neutrinoless double-beta decay?","  We investigate several Pb$(n,n'\gamma$) and Ge$(n,n'\gamma$) reactions. We
measure $\gamma$-ray production from Pb$(n,n'\gamma$) reactions that can be a
significant background for double-beta decay experiments which use lead as a
massive inner shield. Particularly worrisome for Ge-based double-beta decay
experiments are the 2041-keV and 3062-keV $\gamma$ rays produced via
Pb$(n,n'\gamma$). The former is very close to the ^{76}Ge double-beta decay
endpoint energy and the latter has a double escape peak energy near the
endpoint. Excitation $\gamma$-ray lines from Ge$(n,n'\gamma$) reactions are
also observed. We consider the contribution of such backgrounds and their
impact on the sensitivity of next-generation searches for neutrinoless
double-beta decay using enriched germanium detectors.
"
What is the mechanism of ultrafast currents in molecular wires?,"  A novel way to induce ultrafast currents in molecular wires using two
incident laser frequencies, $\omega$ and $2\omega$, is demonstrated. The
mechanism relies on Stark shifts, instead of photon absorption, to transfer
population to the excited states and exploits the temporal profile of the field
to generate phase controllable transport. Calculations in a
\emph{trans}-polyacetylene oligomer coupled to metallic leads indicate that the
mechanism is highly efficient and robust to ultrafast electronic dephasing
processes induced by vibronic couplings.
"
What are the corrections to an analytical formula for combinatorial entropy?,"  Using a one-parameter case as an example, we demonstrate that multicanonical
simulations allow for accurate estimates of the residual combinatorial entropy
of partially ordered ice. For the considered case corrections to an
(approximate) analytical formula are found to be small, never exceeding 0.5%.
The method allows one as well to calculate combinatorial entropies for many
other systems.
"
What is the nature of the magnetic field in axions and axion theories?,"  The investigation on the production of particles in slowly varying but
extremely intense magnetic field in extended to the case of axions. The
motivation is, as for some previously considered cases, the possibility that
such kind of magnetic field may exist around very compact astrophysical
objects.
"
What is the differential transcendence of the K(z) functions?,"  In the article [Petojevic 2006], A. Petojevi\' c verified useful properties
of the $K_{i}(z)$ functions which generalize Kurepa's [Kurepa 1971] left
factorial function. In this note, we present simplified proofs of two of these
results and we answer the open question stated in [Petojevic 2006]. Finally, we
discuss the differential transcendency of the $K_{i}(z)$ functions.
"
What is the min-sum message-passing algorithm and its asynchronous variants?,"  We establish that the min-sum message-passing algorithm and its asynchronous
variants converge for a large class of unconstrained convex optimization
problems.
"
What is the heat-type differential equation of order n greater than two?,"  We study here a heat-type differential equation of order n greater than two,
in the case where the time-derivative is supposed to be fractional. The
corresponding solution can be described as the transition function of a
pseudoprocess (coinciding with the one governed by the standard,
non-fractional, equation) with a time argument T which is itself random. The
distribution of T is presented together with some features of the solution
(such as analytic expressions for its moments).
"
What is the relationship between a pumped charge and the Berry phase in a ferromagnet with finite size?,"  We have investigated pumping in quantum dots from the perspective of
non-Abelian (matrix) Berry phases by solving the time dependent Schr{\""o}dinger
equation exactly for adiabatic changes. Our results demonstrate that a pumped
charge is related to the presence of a finite matrix Berry phase. When
consecutive adiabatic cycles are performed the pumped charge of each cycle is
different from the previous ones.
"
What is the fractal dimension of domain walls in 2d Ising spin glasses?,"  We study domain walls in 2d Ising spin glasses in terms of a minimum-weight
path problem. Using this approach, large systems can be treated exactly. Our
focus is on the fractal dimension $d_f$ of domain walls, which describes via
$<\ell >\simL^{d_f}$ the growth of the average domain-wall length with %%
systems size $L\times L$. %% 20.07.07 OM %% Exploring systems up to L=320 we
yield $d_f=1.274(2)$ for the case of Gaussian disorder, i.e. a much higher
accuracy compared to previous studies. For the case of bimodal disorder, where
many equivalent domain walls exist due to the degeneracy of this model, we
obtain a true lower bound $d_f=1.095(2)$ and a (lower) estimate $d_f=1.395(3)$
as upper bound. Furthermore, we study the distributions of the domain-wall
lengths. Their scaling with system size can be described also only by the
exponent $d_f$, i.e. the distributions are monofractal. Finally, we investigate
the growth of the domain-wall width with system size (``roughness'') and find a
linear behavior.
"
What is the role of core excitation in the reaction mechanism of $^{11}$Be?,"  The elastic scattering and breakup of $^{11}$Be from a proton target at
intermediate energies is studied. We explore the role of core excitation in the
reaction mechanism. Comparison with the data suggests that there is still
missing physics in the description.
"
What is the sufficient condition for a translation invariant factor state on a one dimensional quantum spin chain to be pure?,"  Let $(\clb,\lambda_t,\psi)$ be a $C^*$-dynamical system where $(\lambda_t: t
\in \IT_+)$ be a semigroup of injective endomorphism and $\psi$ be an
$(\lambda_t)$ invariant state on the $C^*$ subalgebra $\clb$ and $\IT_+$ is
either non-negative integers or real numbers. The central aim of this
exposition is to find a useful criteria for the inductive limit state $\clb
\raro^{\lambda_t} \clb$ canonically associated with $\psi$ to be pure. We
achieve this by exploring the minimal weak forward and backward Markov
processes associated with the Markov semigroup on the corner von-Neumann
algebra of the support projection of the state $\psi$ to prove that
Kolmogorov's property [Mo2] of the Markov semigroup is a sufficient condition
for the inductive state to be pure. As an application of this criteria we find
a sufficient condition for a translation invariant factor state on a one
dimensional quantum spin chain to be pure. This criteria in a sense complements
criteria obtained in [BJKW,Mo2] as we could go beyond lattice symmetric states.
"
What was the correction to the conceptual framework of the original paper?,"  This paper, which commented on Newman and Leicht's ""Mixture models and
exploratory analysis in networks"" (2007, PNAS 104, 9564-9569), has been
withdrawn. The reason for this removal is that we misinterpreted the conceptual
framework that the authors of the original paper use. Specifically, it is
assumed in our paper that the variable theta_ri denotes the *a priori*
probability that there exists an edge from group r to vertex i. The correct
interpretation is that theta_ri denotes the probability that a given edge from
group r connects to vertex i.
  We are very grateful to Mark Newman and Elizabeth Leicht not only for
pointing out our misinterpretation, but also for doing it so politely and
gracefully.
"
What are the key concepts in a Lagrangian framework for computing?,"  We derive explicit, uniform, a priori interior Hessian and gradient estimates
for special Lagrangian equations of all phases in dimension two.
"
How does the proposed revision of the classification system based on the TiO/CaH ratio address the deficiencies in the current system?,"  The current classification system of M stars on the main sequence
distinguishes three metallicity classes (dwarfs - dM, subdwarfs - sdM, and
extreme subdwarfs - esdM). The spectroscopic definition of these classes is
based on the relative strength of prominent CaH and TiO molecular absorption
bands near 7000A, as quantified by three spectroscopic indices (CaH2, CaH3, and
TiO5). We re-examine this classification system in light of our ongoing
spectroscopic survey of stars with proper motion \mu > 0.45 ""/yr, which has
increased the census of spectroscopically identified metal-poor M stars to over
400 objects. Kinematic separation of disk dwarfs and halo subdwarfs suggest
deficiencies in the current classification system. Observations of common
proper motion doubles indicates that the current dM/sdM and sdM/esdM boundaries
in the [TiO5,CaH2+CaH3] index plane do not follow iso-metallicity contours,
leaving some binaries inappropriately classified as dM+sdM or sdM+esdM. We
propose a revision of the classification system based on an empirical
calibration of the TiO/CaH ratio for stars of near solar metallicity. We
introduce the parameter \zeta_{TiO/CaH} which quantifies the weakening of the
TiO bandstrength due to metallicity effect, with values ranging from
\zeta_{TiO/CaH}=1 for stars of near-solar metallicity to \zeta_{TiO/CaH}~0 for
the most metal-poor (and TiO depleted) subdwarfs. We redefine the metallicity
classes based on the value of the parameter \zeta_{TiO/CaH}; and refine the
scheme by introducing an additional class of ultra subdwarfs (usdM). We
introduce sequences of sdM, esdM, and usdM stars to be used as formal
classification standards.
"
What is the superfield transformation law for the N=8 supersymmetric action?,"  Using an N=4, d=1 superfield approach, we construct an N=8 supersymmetric
action of the self-interacting off-shell N=8 multiplet {\bf (1, 8, 7)}. This
action is found to be invariant under the exceptional N=8, d=1 superconformal
group F(4) with the R-symmetry subgroup SO(7). The general N=8 supersymmetric
{\bf (1, 8, 7)} action is a sum of the superconformal action and the previously
known free bilinear action. We show that the general action is also
superconformal, but with respect to redefined superfield transformation laws.
The scalar potential can be generated by two Fayet-Iliopoulos N=4 superfield
terms which preserve N=8 supersymmetry but break the superconformal and SO(7)
symmetries.
"
What are the current peaks observed in the wires of the double-quantum-well structure?,"  We present the results of non-linear tunnelling spectroscopy between an array
of independent quantum wires and an adjacent two-dimensional electron gas
(2DEG) in a double-quantum-well structure. The two layers are separately
contacted using a surface-gate scheme, and the wires are all very regular, with
dimensions chosen carefully so that there is minimal modulation of the 2DEG by
the gates defining the wires. We have mapped the dispersion spectrum of the 1D
wires down to the depletion of the last 1D subband by measuring the conductance
\emph{G} as a function of the in-plane magnetic field \emph{B}, the interlayer
bias $V_{\rm dc}$ and the wire gate voltage. There is a strong suppression of
tunnelling at zero bias, with temperature and dc-bias dependences consistent
with power laws, as expected for a Tomonaga-Luttinger Liquid caused by
electron-electron interactions in the wires. In addition, the current peaks fit
the free-electron model quite well, but with just one 1D subband there is extra
structure that may indicate interactions.
"
What is the algebraic proof of this fact?,"  Let c^{k,l}(n) be the number of compositions (ordered partitions) of the
integer n whose Ferrers diagram fits inside a k-by-l rectangle. The purpose of
this note is to give a simple, algebraic proof of a conjecture of Vatter that
the sequence c^{k,l}(0), c^{k,l}(1), ..., c^{k,l}(kl) is unimodal. The problem
of giving a combinatorial proof of this fact is discussed, but is still open.
"
How does the contribution of neutrons to the hadronic signals depend on the distance from the shower axis?,"  The contributions of neutrons to hadronic signals from the DREAM calorimeter
are measured by analyzing the time structure of these signals. The neutrons,
which mainly originate from the evaporation stage of nuclear breakup in the
hadronic shower development process, contribute through elastic scattering off
protons in the plastic scintillating fibers which provide the $dE/dx$
information in this calorimeter. This contribution is characterized by an
exponential tail in the pulse shape, with a time constant of $\sim 25$ ns. The
relative contribution of neutrons to the signals increases with the distance
from the shower axis. As expected, the neutrons do not contribute to the DREAM
\v{C}erenkov signals.

What are the applications of patchwork dynamics in studying the coarsening and memory effects for spin glasses and random ferromagnets?,"  Slow dynamics in disordered materials prohibits direct simulation of their
rich nonequilibrium behavior at large scales. ""Patchwork dynamics"" is
introduced to mimic relaxation over a very broad range of time scales by
equilibrating or optimizing directly on successive length scales. This dynamics
is used to study coarsening and to replicate memory effects for spin glasses
and random ferromagnets. It is also used to find, with high confidence, exact
ground states in large or toroidal samples.
"
What is the semiclassical method used to treat the proton breakup from a weakly bound state?,"  We present a semiclassical method to treat the proton breakup from a weakly
bound state in an exotic nucleus. The Coulomb interactions between the proton,
core and target are treated to all orders and including the full multipole
expansion of the Coulomb potential. The nuclear proton-target interaction is
also treated to all orders. The core-target interaction is included as an
absorption. The method is semi-analytical thus allowing for a detailed
understanding of the short range and long range effects of the interactions in
the reaction dynamics. It explains also the origin of possible asymmetries in
the core parallel momentum distributions when the full multipole expansion of
the Coulomb potential is used. Calculations are compared to results of other,
fully numerical, methods and to experimental data in order to establish the
accuracy and reliability of the method.
"
What is the neutralino dark matter in the framework of SUSY GUTs?,"  We consider neutralino dark matter within the framework of SUSY GUTs with
non-universal gaugino masses. In particular we focus on the case of SU(5) with
a SUSY breaking F-term in the 1, 24, 75 and 200 dimensional representations. We
discuss the 24 case in some detail, and show that the bulk dark matter region
cannot be accessed. We then go on to consider the admixture of the singlet SUSY
breaking F-term with one of the 24, 75 or 200 dimensional F-terms, and show
that in these cases it becomes possible to access the bulk regions
corresponding to low fine-tuned dark matter. Our results are presented in the
$(M_1,M_2)$ plane for fixed $M_3$ and so are useful for considering general GUT
models, as well as more general non-universal gaugino models.
"
What is the nature of hotspots in the kpc-scale structures of powerful radio galaxies?,"  I discuss the nature of `hotspots' and `jet knots' in the kpc-scale
structures of powerful radio galaxies and their relationship to jet-environment
interactions. I describe evidence for interaction between the jets of FRI
sources and their local environments, and discuss its relationship to particle
acceleration, but the main focus of the paper is the hotspots of FRIIs and on
new observational evidence on the nature of the particle acceleration
associated with them.

What is the relationship between the complexity of the spin wave modes and the spin boundary condition in a ferromagnet with finite size?,"  Discussion of ``2004 IMS Medallion Lecture: Local Rademacher complexities and
oracle inequalities in risk minimization'' by V. Koltchinskii [arXiv:0708.0083]
"
What is the covariant phase space for Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity in arbitrary dimensions?,"  The isolated horizon framework was introduced in order to provide a local
description of black holes that are in equilibrium with their (possibly
dynamic) environment. Over the past several years, the framework has been
extended to include matter fields (dilaton, Yang-Mills etc) in D=4 dimensions
and cosmological constant in $D\geq3$ dimensions. In this article we present a
further extension of the framework that includes black holes in
higher-dimensional Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet (EGB) gravity. In particular, we
construct a covariant phase space for EGB gravity in arbitrary dimensions which
allows us to derive the first law. We find that the entropy of a weakly
isolated and non-rotating horizon is given by
$\mathcal{S}=(1/4G_{D})\oint_{S^{D-2}}\bm{\tilde{\epsilon}}(1+2\alpha\mathcal{R})$.
In this expression $S^{D-2}$ is the $(D-2)$-dimensional cross section of the
horizon with area form $\bm{\tilde{\epsilon}}$ and Ricci scalar $\mathcal{R}$,
$G_{D}$ is the $D$-dimensional Newton constant and $\alpha$ is the Gauss-Bonnet
parameter. This expression for the horizon entropy is in agreement with those
predicted by the Euclidean and Noether charge methods. Thus we extend the
isolated horizon framework beyond Einstein gravity.
"
What are the distinct manipulators displayed at their isotropic postures?,"  A spherical wrist of the serial type with n revolute (R) joints is said to be
isotropic if it can attain a posture whereby the singular values of its
Jacobian matrix are all equal to sqrt(n/3). What isotropy brings about is
robustness to manufacturing, assembly, and measurement errors, thereby
guaranteeing a maximum orientation accuracy. In this paper we investigate the
existence of redundant isotropic architectures, which should add to the
dexterity of the wrist under design by virtue of its extra degree of freedom.
The problem formulation, for, leads to a system of eight quadratic equations
with eight unknowns. The Bezout number of this system is thus 2^8=256, its BKK
bound being 192. However, the actual number of solutions is shown to be 32. We
list all solutions of the foregoing algebraic problem. All these solutions are
real, but distinct solutions do not necessarily lead to distinct manipulators.
Upon discarding those algebraic solutions that yield no new wrists, we end up
with exactly eight distinct architectures, the eight corresponding manipulators
being displayed at their isotropic postures.
"
What is the Chern-Simons action in the Chern-Simons theory?,"  We construct consistent bosonic higher-spin gauge theories in odd dimensions
D>3 based on Chern-Simons forms. The gauge groups are infinite-dimensional
higher-spin extensions of the Anti-de Sitter groups SO(D-1,2). We propose an
invariant tensor on these algebras, which is required for the definition of the
Chern-Simons action. The latter contains the purely gravitational Chern-Simons
theories constructed by Chamseddine, and so the entire theory describes a
consistent coupling of higher-spin fields to a particular form of Lovelock
gravity. It contains topological as well as non-topological phases. Focusing on
D=5 we consider as an example for the latter an AdS_4 x S^1 Kaluza-Klein
background. By solving the higher-spin torsion constraints in the case of a
spin-3 field, we verify explicitly that the equations of motion reduce in the
linearization to the compensator form of the Fronsdal equations on AdS_4.
"
What is the relationship between the quark fragmentation function and the Born approximation?,"  We propose a solution for the long standing puzzle of a too steeply falling
fragmentation function for a quark fragmenting into a pion, calculated by
Berger [1] in the Born approximation. Contrary to the simple anticipation that
gluon resummation worsens the problem, we find good agreement with data. Higher
quark Fock states slow down the quark, an effect which we call jet lag. It can
be also expressed in terms of vacuum energy loss. As a result, the space-time
development of the jet shrinks and the $z$-dependence becomes flatter than in
the Born approximation. The space-time pattern is also of great importance for
in-medium hadronization.
"
How do tidal waves influence the orbital evolution of particles in a tidally perturbed gaseous disk?,"  We investigate both analytically and numerically the motion of massless
particles orbiting primary star in a close circular binary system with
particular focus on the gas drag effects. These are the first calculations with
particles ranging in size from 1m to 10km, which account for the presence of a
tidally perturbed gaseous disk. We have found numerically that the radial mass
transport by the tidal waves plays a crucial role in the orbital evolution of
particles. Numerical results are confirmed analytical calculations that do not
assume anything about origin of the radial flow in the disk. We demonstrate
that the migration rate of a particle in a disk out of radial equilibrium is
enhanced due to the enhanced mass flux of gas colliding with the particle and
the migration is always directed inward regardless of the sign of the radial
gas velocity. Within the framework of the perturbation theory we derive
general, formulae for short-term variations of the particle semi-major axis,
eccentricity and inclination in such disk. The formulae account for departures
from axial symmetry by introducing effective components of the gas velocity.
They agree with numerical results within several percent. We have also found in
numerical simulations that the tidal waves introduce coherence in periastron
longitude and eccentricity for particles on neighbouring orbits. The degree of
the coherence depends on the particle size and on the distance from the primary
star, being most prominent for particles with 10m radius. The results are
important mainly in the context of planetesimal formation and, to a lesser
degree, during the early planetesimal accretion stage.
"
"What are the Riesz, Szegö, and inner-outer type factorizations of $H^p(\A)$?","  Let $\A$ be a finite subdiagonal algebra in Arveson's sense. Let $H^p(\A)$ be
the associated noncommutative Hardy spaces, $0<p\le\8$. We extend to the case
of all positive indices most recent results about these spaces, which include
notably the Riesz, Szeg\""o and inner-outer type factorizations. One new tool of
the paper is the contractivity of the underlying conditional expectation on
$H^p(\A)$ for $p<1$.
"
What is the differential lag between the red and blue wings of the line?,"  Using archival International AGN Watch observations we find a correlation
between the asymmetry of the H-beta line and the system luminosity: the line
becomes bluer as the system gets brighter. We also find a differential lag
between the red and blue wings of the line: the blue wing lags the red by ~4
days, suggesting an inflow component of the BLR.
"
What are the conditions to ensure that all the roots of Q(y) are contained within the range of y(z)?,"  Let P(z) and Q(y) be polynomials of the same degree k>=1 in the complex
variables z and y, respectively. In this extended abstract we study the
non-linear functional equation P(z)=Q(y(z)), where y(z) is restricted to be
analytic in a neighborhood of z=0. We provide sufficient conditions to ensure
that all the roots of Q(y) are contained within the range of y(z) as well as to
have y(z)=z as the unique analytic solution of the non-linear equation. Our
results are motivated from uniqueness considerations of polynomial canonical
representations of the phase or amplitude terms of oscillatory integrals
encountered in the asymptotic analysis of the coefficients of mixed powers and
multivariable generating functions via saddle-point methods. Uniqueness shall
prove important for developing algorithms to determine the Taylor coefficients
of the terms appearing in these representations. The uniqueness of Levinson's
polynomial canonical representations of analytic functions in several variables
follows as a corollary of our one-complex variables results.
"
What is the torque per unit mass in the turbulent flow compared to the single-phase flow?,"  We study liquid-liquid dispersions in a turbulent Taylor-Couette flow,
produced between two counterrotating coaxial cylinders. In pure Water and in
counterrotation, Reynolds numbers up to 1.4 10^5 are reached. The liquids we
use are a low-viscous Oil and pure Water or a Sodium Iodide solution with a
refractive index matched to that of Oil, in order to get transparent
dispersions. We first characterize the single-phase flow, in terms of threshold
for transition to turbulence, scaling of the torque and measurements of the
mean flow and of the Reynolds stress by stereoscopic PIV. We then study the
increase of the dissipation in the two-phase flows and find that the torque per
unit mass can be twice the torque for a single-phase flow. Long-time behaviours
are also reported.
"
What is the result of photometric monitoring of the Melotte 66 field in BVI filters?,"  We report the results of photometric monitoring of the Melotte 66 field in
BVI filters. Ten variables were identified with nine being new discoveries. The
sample includes eight eclipsing binaries of which four are W UMa type stars,
one star is a candidate blue straggler. All four contact binaries are likely
members of the cluster based on their estimated distances. Ten blue stars with
U-B<-0.3 were detected inside a 14.8 x 22.8 arcmin^2 field centred on the
cluster. Time series photometry for 7 of them showed no evidence for any
variability. The brightest object in the sample of blue stars is a promising
candidate for a hot subdwarf belonging to the cluster. We show that the
anomalously wide main sequence of the cluster, reported in some earlier
studies, results from a combination of two effects: variable reddening occuring
across the cluster field and the presence of a rich population of binary stars
in the cluster itself. The density profile of the cluster field is derived and
the total number of member stars with 16<V<21 or 2.8<M_{V}<7.8 is estimated
conservatively at about 1100.
"
What are the two covariant methods used to calculate the light-cone wave function of the pseudoscalar meson?,"  Having calculated the light-cone wave function of the pseudoscalar meson by
using two equivalent and fully covariant methods, we generalize such methods to
the valence Fock states of the vector meson in the light-cone formalism. We
investigate the decay constant of the $\rho$ meson $f_{\rho}$, the
$\gamma^{\ast} \pi \to \rho $ and $\gamma^* \rho \to \pi $ transition form
factors and especially the transition magnetic moments. By using two groups of
constraint parameters, we predict the space-like and time-like form factors
$F_{\pi \rho}(Q^2)$ and $F_{\rho \pi}(Q^2)$ at low and moderate energy scale
and the electromagnetic radius of these transition processes. In addition, we
extend our calculation to $\gamma^* \pi \to \omega$ space-like and time-like
form factors by using the same sets of parameters.
"
What are the implications of the inhomogeneous structure in the surface model?,"  We find three distinct phases; a tubular phase, a planar phase, and the
spherical phase, in a triangulated fluid surface model. It is also found that
these phases are separated by discontinuous transitions. The fluid surface
model is investigated within the framework of the conventional curvature model
by using the canonical Monte Carlo simulations with dynamical triangulations.
The mechanical strength of the surface is given only by skeletons, and no
two-dimensional bending energy is assumed in the Hamiltonian. The skeletons are
composed of elastic linear-chains and rigid junctions and form a
compartmentalized structure on the surface, and for this reason the vertices of
triangles can diffuse freely only inside the compartments. As a consequence, an
inhomogeneous structure is introduced in the model; the surface strength inside
the compartments is different from the surface strength on the compartments.
However, the rotational symmetry is not influenced by the elastic skeletons;
there is no specific direction on the surface. In addition to the three phases
mentioned above, a collapsed phase is expected to exist in the low bending
rigidity regime that was not studied here. The inhomogeneous structure and the
fluidity of vertices are considered to be the origin of such variety of phases.
"
What is the effect of the skew scattering on the extrinsic spin Hall conductivity in a steady state?,"  The kinetics of the extrinsic spin Hall conductivity induced by the skew
scattering is performed from the fully microscopic kinetic spin Bloch equation
approach in $(001)$ GaAs symmetric quantum well. In the steady state, the
extrinsic spin Hall current/conductivity vanishes for the linear-$\mathbf k$
dependent spin-orbit coupling and is very small for the cubic-$\mathbf k$
dependent spin-orbit coupling. The spin precession induced by the
Dresselhaus/Rashba spin-orbit coupling plays a very important role in the
vanishment of the extrinsic spin Hall conductivity in the steady state. An
in-plane spin polarization is induced by the skew scattering, with the help of
the spin-orbit coupling. This spin polarization is very different from the
current-induced spin polarization.
"
What is the solution for the open spin-1/2 XXZ quantum spin chain with N spins and two arbitrary boundary parameters at roots of unity?,"  Using our solution for the open spin-1/2 XXZ quantum spin chain with N spins
and two arbitrary boundary parameters at roots of unity, the central charge and
the conformal dimensions for bulk hole excitations are derived from the 1/N
correction to the energy (Casimir energy).
"
What is the relationship between X-ray and radio data from black hole and neutron star binaries?,"  (abridged) We review how the recent increase in X-ray and radio data from
black hole and neutron star binaries can be merged together with theoretical
advances to give a coherent picture of the physics of the accretion flow in
strong gravity. Both long term X-ray light curves, X-ray spectra, the rapid
X-ray variability and the radio jet behaviour are consistent with a model where
a standard outer accretion disc is truncated at low luminosities, being
replaced by a hot, inner flow which also acts as the launching site of the jet.
Decreasing the disc truncation radius leads to softer spectra, as well as
higher frequencies (including QPO's) in the power spectra, and a faster jet.
The collapse of the hot flow when the disc reaches the last stable orbit
triggers the dramatic decrease in radio flux, as well as giving a qualitative
(and often quantitative) explanation for the major hard--soft spectral
transition seen in black holes and neutron stars.
  After collapse of the hot inner flow, the spectrum in black hole systems can
be dominated by the disc emission. Its behaviour is consistent with the
existence of a last stable orbit, and such data can be used to estimate the
black hole spin. These systems can also show very different spectra at these
high luminosities, in which the disc spectrum is strongly distorted by
Comptonization. The structure of the accretion flow becomes increasingly
uncertain as the luminosity approaches (and exceeds) the Eddington luminosity,
though there is growing evidence that winds play an important role. We stress
that these high Eddington fraction flows are key to understanding many
disparate and currently very active fields such as ULX, Narrow Line Seyfert
1's, and the growth of the first black holes in the Early Universe.
"
What is the relationship between the quark (antiquark) production and the chromo-electric field $E^a(t)$?,"  We study the Schwinger mechanism in QCD in the presence of an arbitrary
time-dependent chromo-electric background field $E^a(t)$ with arbitrary color
index $a$=1,2,...8 in SU(3). We obtain an exact result for the non-perturbative
quark (antiquark) production from an arbitrary $E^a(t)$ by directly evaluating
the path integral. We find that the exact result is independent of all the time
derivatives $\frac{d^nE^a(t)}{dt^n}$ where $n=1,2,...\infty$. This result has
the same functional dependence on two Casimir invariants $[E^a(t)E^a(t)]$ and
$[d_{abc}E^a(t)E^b(t)E^c(t)]^2$ as the constant chromo-electric field $E^a$
result with the replacement: $E^a \rightarrow E^a(t)$. This result relies
crucially on the validity of the shift conjecture, which has not yet been
established.
"
What is the origin of the soft excess emission in the cluster centre?,"  We present an analysis of new Suzaku data and archival data from XMM-Newton
of the cluster of galaxies Sersic 159-03, which has a strong soft X-ray excess
emission component. The Suzaku observation confirms the presence of the soft
excess emission, but it does not confirm the presence of redshifted OVII lines
in the cluster. Radial profiles and 2D maps derived from XMM-Newton
observations show that the soft excess emission has a strong peak at the
position of the central cD galaxy and the maps do not show any significant
azimuthal variations. Although the soft excess emission can be fitted equally
well with both thermal and non-thermal models, its spatial distribution is
neither consistent with the models of intercluster warm-hot filaments, nor with
models of clumpy warm intracluster gas associated with infalling groups. Using
the data obtained by the XMM-Newton Reflection Grating Spectrometers we do not
confirm the presence of the warm gas in the cluster centre with the expected
properties assuming the soft excess is of thermal origin. The observed
properties of the soft excess emission are consistent with the non-thermal
interpretation. While the high density of relativistic electrons associated
with the peak of the soft emission in the cluster centre might have been
provided by an active galactic nucleus in the central cD galaxy, the underlying
population might have been accelerated in diffuse shocks.
"
How many points of bounded height are there in a projective variety of dimension greater than or equal to 2?,"  In this brief note, we will investigate the number of points of bounded
(twisted) height in a projective variety defined over a function field, where
the function field comes from a projective variety of dimension greater than or
equal to 2. A first step in this investigation is to understand the $p$-adic
analytic properties of the height zeta function. In particular, we will show
that for a large class of projective varieties this function is $p$-adic
meromorphic.
"
What is the cotangent bundle Lie algebroid of a Poisson homogeneous space?,"  We identify the cotangent bundle Lie algebroid of a Poisson homogeneous space
G/H of a Poisson Lie group G as a quotient of a transformation Lie algebroid
over G. As applications, we describe the modular vector fields of G/H, and we
identify the Poisson cohomology of G/H with coefficients in powers of its
canonical line bundle with relative Lie algebra cohomology of the Drinfeld Lie
algebra associated to G/H. We also construct a Poisson groupoid over G/H which
is symplectic near the identity section. This note serves as preparation for
forthcoming papers, in which we will compute explicitly the Poisson cohomology
and study their symplectic groupoids for certain examples of Poisson
homogeneous spaces related to semi-simple Lie groups.
"
What is the shape anisotropy in a thin film?,"  In planar nano-magnetic devices magnetization direction is kept close to a
given plane by the large easy-plane magnetic anisotropy, for example by the
shape anisotropy in a thin film. In this case magnetization shows effectively
in-plane dynamics with only one angle required for its description. Moreover,
the motion can become overdamped even for small values of Gilbert damping. We
derive the equations of effective in-plane dynamics in the presence of
spin-transfer torques. The simplifications achieved in the overdamped regime
allow to study systems with several dynamic magnetic pieces (``free layers'').
A transition from a spin-transfer device with a static polarizer to a device
with two equivalent magnets is observed. When the size difference between the
magnets is less than critical, the device does not exhibit switching, but goes
directly into the ``windmill'' precession state.
"
How are smooth nets on a surface represented in a discrete set of points approximated by a second-order approximation?,"  We study local and global approximations of smooth nets of curvature lines
and smooth conjugate nets by respective discrete nets (circular nets and planar
quadrilateral nets) with infinitesimal quads. It is shown that choosing the
points of discrete nets on the smooth surface one can obtain second-order
approximation globally. Also a simple geometric construction for approximate
determination of principal directions of smooth surfaces is given.
"
Can mutations that are neutral with respect to a protein's primary biological function lead to changes in its promiscuous functions?,"  BACKGROUND: Many of the mutations accumulated by naturally evolving proteins
are neutral in the sense that they do not significantly alter a protein's
ability to perform its primary biological function. However, new protein
functions evolve when selection begins to favor other, ""promiscuous"" functions
that are incidental to a protein's biological role. If mutations that are
neutral with respect to a protein's primary biological function cause
substantial changes in promiscuous functions, these mutations could enable
future functional evolution.
  RESULTS: Here we investigate this possibility experimentally by examining how
cytochrome P450 enzymes that have evolved neutrally with respect to activity on
a single substrate have changed in their abilities to catalyze reactions on
five other substrates. We find that the enzymes have sometimes changed as much
as four-fold in the promiscuous activities. The changes in promiscuous
activities tend to increase with the number of mutations, and can be largely
rationalized in terms of the chemical structures of the substrates. The
activities on chemically similar substrates tend to change in a coordinated
fashion, potentially providing a route for systematically predicting the change
in one function based on the measurement of several others.
  CONCLUSIONS: Our work suggests that initially neutral genetic drift can lead
to substantial changes in protein functions that are not currently under
selection, in effect poising the proteins to more readily undergo functional
evolution should selection ""ask new questions"" in the future.
"
What is the quantum effective superpotential W_mic in the N=1 super Yang-Mills theory?,"  We consider the N=1 super Yang-Mills theory with gauge group U(N), adjoint
chiral multiplet X and tree-level superpotential Tr W(X). We compute the
quantum effective superpotential W_mic as a function of arbitrary off-shell
boundary conditions at infinity for the scalar field X. This effective
superpotential has a remarkable property: its critical points are in one-to-one
correspondence with the full set of quantum vacua of the theory, providing in
particular a unified picture of solutions with different ranks for the low
energy gauge group. In this sense, W_mic is a good microscopic effective
quantum superpotential for the theory. This property is not shared by other
quantum effective superpotentials commonly used in the literature, like in the
strong coupling approach or the glueball superpotentials. The result of this
paper is a first step in extending Nekrasov's microscopic derivation of the
Seiberg-Witten solution of N=2 super Yang-Mills theories to the realm of N=1
gauge theories.
"
What is the relationship between the torus group and the automorphism of a free group?,"  We prove that the mapping torus group $\FN \rtimes_{\alpha} \Z$ of any
automorphism $\alpha$ of a free group $\FN$ of finite rank $n \geq 2$ is weakly
hyperbolic relative to the canonical (up to conjugation) family $\mathcal
H(\alpha)$ of subgroups of $\FN$ which consists of (and contains
representatives of all) conjugacy classes that grow polynomially under
iteration of $\alpha$. Furthermore, we show that $\FN \rtimes_{\alpha} \Z$ is
strongly hyperbolic relative to the mapping torus of the family $\mathcal
H(\alpha)$. As an application, we use a result of Drutu-Sapir to deduce that
$\FN \rtimes_{\alpha} \Z$ has Rapic Decay.
"
"What are the results characterizing an $A_\infty$-structure on $H^*(C_n\times C_m,k)$?","  Suppose k is a field of characteristic 2, and $n,m\geq 4$ powers of 2. Then
the $A_\infty$-structure of the group cohomology algebras $H^*(C_n,k)$ and
$(H^*(C_m,k)$ are well known. We give results characterizing an
$A_\infty$-structure on $H^*(C_n\times C_m,k)$ including limits on
non-vanishing low-arity operations and an infinite family of non-vanishing
higher operations.
"
What is the stability of a d.c. (delta-convex) function on a normed linear space?,"  A d.c. (delta-convex) function on a normed linear space is a function
representable as a difference of two continuous convex functions. We show that
an infinite dimensional analogue of Hartman's theorem on stability of d.c.
functions under compositions does not hold in general. However, we prove that
it holds in some interesting particular cases. Our main results about
compositions are proved in the more general context of d.c. mappings between
normed linear spaces.
"
Is the vacuum configuration of the zero mode for the Euclidean time direction nontrivial?,"  We study gauge theories with/without an extra dimension at finite
temperature, in which there are two kinds of order parameters of gauge symmetry
breaking. The one is the zero mode of the gauge field for the Euclidean time
direction and the other is that for the direction of the extra dimension. We
evaluate the effective potential for the zero modes in one-loop approximation
and investigate the vacuum configuration in detail. Our analyses show that
gauge symmetry can be broken only through the zero mode for the direction of
the extra dimension and no nontrivial vacuum configuration of the zero mode for
the Euclidean time direction is found.
"
What is the approach to compensate for the CFO in a distributed antenna system?,"  Multiple carrier-frequency offsets (CFO) arise in a distributed antenna
system, where data are transmitted simultaneously from multiple antennas. In
such systems the received signal contains multiple CFOs due to mismatch between
the local oscillators of transmitters and receiver. This results in a
time-varying rotation of the data constellation, which needs to be compensated
for at the receiver before symbol recovery. This paper proposes a new approach
for blind CFO estimation and symbol recovery. The received base-band signal is
over-sampled, and its polyphase components are used to formulate a virtual
Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) problem. By applying blind MIMO system
estimation techniques, the system response is estimated and used to
subsequently transform the multiple CFOs estimation problem into many
independent single CFO estimation problems. Furthermore, an initial estimate of
the CFO is obtained from the phase of the MIMO system response. The Cramer-Rao
Lower bound is also derived, and the large sample performance of the proposed
estimator is compared to the bound.
"
What are the two regimes of the Euler walk on a Cayley tree?,"  We show that the Euler walk on a Cayley tree exhibits two regimes (dynamic
phases): a condensed phase and a low-density phase. In the condensed phase the
self-organized area grows as a compact domain. In the low-density phase the
proportion of self-organized (visited) nodes decreases rapidly from one
generation of the tree to the next. We describe in detail returns of the Euler
walk to the root and growth of the self-organized domain in the condensed
phase. We also investigate the critical behaviour of the Euler walk at the
point separating the two regimes.
"
What are the valence and conduction band offsets of the photocurrent in GaN?,"  Band discontinuities at the InN-GaN heterointerface are experimentally
determined from internal photoemission spectroscopy measurements on n+ InN on
GaN epilayers. The photocurrent shows two threshold energies, one at 1.624 eV
and the other at 2.527 eV. From these we obtain the valence band offset 0.85 eV
and the conduction band offset 1.82 eV.
"
What are the key challenges in combining Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) with strong-coupling cavities?,"  An optical cavity enhances the interaction between atoms and light, and the
rate of coherent atom-photon coupling can be made larger than all decoherence
rates of the system. For single atoms, this strong coupling regime of cavity
quantum electrodynamics (cQED) has been the subject of spectacular experimental
advances, and great efforts have been made to control the coupling rate by
trapping and cooling the atom towards the motional ground state, which has been
achieved in one dimension so far. For N atoms, the three-dimensional ground
state of motion is routinely achieved in atomic Bose-Einstein condensates
(BECs), but although first experiments combining BECs and optical cavities have
been reported recently, coupling BECs to strong-coupling cavities has remained
an elusive goal. Here we report such an experiment, which is made possible by
combining a new type of fibre-based cavity with atom chip technology. This
allows single-atom cQED experiments with a simplified setup and realizes the
new situation of N atoms in a cavity each of which is identically and strongly
coupled to the cavity mode. Moreover, the BEC can be positioned
deterministically anywhere within the cavity and localized entirely within a
single antinode of the standing-wave cavity field. This gives rise to a
controlled, tunable coupling rate, as we confirm experimentally. We study the
heating rate caused by a cavity transmission measurement as a function of the
coupling rate and find no measurable heating for strongly coupled BECs. The
spectrum of the coupled atoms-cavity system, which we map out over a wide range
of atom numbers and cavity-atom detunings, shows vacuum Rabi splittings
exceeding 20 gigahertz, as well as an unpredicted additional splitting which we
attribute to the atomic hyperfine structure.
"
What is the quantum description of a system represented in terms of the asymptotic Bethe ansatz?,"  We explain the relationship between the classical description of an
integrable system in terms of invariant tori and action-angle variables, and
the quantum description in terms of the asymptotic Bethe ansatz.
"
"What is the extended Standard Model with Terascale, negative-norm copies of the SM fields?","  In an extension of the Standard Model(SM) based on the ideas of Lee and Wick,
Grinstein, O'Connell and Wise have found an interesting way to remove the usual
quadratically divergent contributions to the Higgs mass induced by radiative
corrections. Phenomenologically, the model predicts the existence of Terascale,
negative-norm copies of the usual SM fields with rather unique properties:
ghost-like propagators and negative decay widths, but with otherwise SM-like
couplings. The model is both unitary and causal on macroscopic scales. In this
paper we examine whether or not such states with these unusual properties can
be uniquely identified as such at the LHC. We find that in the extended strong
and electroweak gauge boson sector of the model, which is the simplest one to
analyze, such an identification can be rather difficult. Observation of heavy
gluon-like resonances in the dijet channel offers the best hope for this
identification.
"
What is the $k$-th order Sobolev inequality in the hyperbolic space?,"  In this paper, we obtain the sharp $k$-th order Sobolev inequalities in the
hyperbolic space ${\H}^n$ for all $k=1,2,3,\cdots$. This gives an answer to an
open question raised by Aubin in [5, p.$\;$176-177] for $W^{k,2}({\H}^n)$ with
$k>1$. In addition, we prove that the associated Sobolev constants are optimal.
"
What are the parameters of the new cyclic difference families constructed in this paper?,"  We construct many new cyclic (v;r,s;lambda) difference families with v less
than or equal 50. In particular we construct the difference families with
parameters (45;18,10;9), (45;22,22;21), (47;21,12;12), (47;19,15;12),
(47;22,14;14), (48;20,10;10), (48;24,4;12), (50;25,20;20) for which the
existence question was an open problem. The (45;22,22;21) difference family
gives a BIBD with parameters v=45, b=90, r=44, k=22 and lambda=21, and the one
with parameters (50;25,20;20) gives a pair of binary sequences of length 50
with zero periodic autocorrelation function (the periodic analog of a Golay
pair). We also construct nine new D-optimal designs. A normal form for cyclic
difference families is proposed and used effectively in compiling the list of
known and new difference families.
"
What is the formula for the local Fourier-Laplace transform of a meromorphic function?,"  We give an explicit formula (i.e., a formal stationary phase formula) for the
local Fourier-Laplace transform of a formal germ of meromorphic connection of
one complex variable with a possibly irregular singularity. This is a complex
analogue of the formulas in the preprint math/0702436v1.
"
What is the representation theorem for tracial gauge norms on finite von Neumann algebras?,"  In this paper we set up a representation theorem for tracial gauge norms on
finite von Neumann algebras satisfying the weak Dixmier property in terms of Ky
Fan norms. Examples of tracial gauge norms on finite von Neumann algebras
satisfying the weak Dixmier property include unitarily invariant norms on
finite factors (type ${\rm II}\sb 1$ factors and $M_n(\cc)$) and symmetric
gauge norms on $L^\infty[0,1]$ and $\cc^n$. As the first application, we obtain
that the class of unitarily invariant norms on a type ${\rm II}\sb 1$ factor
coincides with the class of symmetric gauge norms on $L^\infty[0,1]$ and von
Neumann's classical result \cite{vN} on unitarily invariant norms on
$M_n(\cc)$. As the second application, Ky Fan's dominance theorem \cite{Fan} is
obtained for finite von Neumann algebras satisfying the weak Dixmier property.
As the third application, some classical results in non-commutative
$L^p$-theory (e.g., non-commutative H$\ddot{\text{o}}$lder's inequality,
duality and reflexivity of non-commutative $L^p$-spaces) are obtained for
general unitarily invariant norms on finite factors. We also investigate the
extreme points of $\NN(\M)$, the convex compact set (in the pointwise weak
topology) of normalized unitarily invariant norms (the norm of the identity
operator is 1) on a finite factor $\M$. We obtain all extreme points of
$\NN(M_2(\cc))$ and many extreme points of $\NN(M_n(\cc))$ ($n\geq 3$). For a
type ${\rm II}\sb 1$ factor $\M$, we prove that if $t$ ($0\leq t\leq 1$) is a
rational number then the Ky Fan $t$-th norm is an extreme point of $\NN(\M)$.
"
What is the condition for directed motion in a viscous fluid with zero Reynolds number?,"  Purcell's scallop theorem defines the type of motions of a solid body -
reciprocal motions - which cannot propel the body in a viscous fluid with zero
Reynolds number. For example, the flapping of a wing is reciprocal and, as was
recently shown, can lead to directed motion only if its frequency Reynolds
number, Re_f, is above a critical value of order one. Using elementary
examples, we show the existence of oscillatory reciprocal motions which are
effective for all arbitrarily small values of the frequency Reynolds number and
induce net velocities scaling as (Re_f)^\alpha (alpha > 0). This demonstrates a
continuous breakdown of the scallop theorem with inertia.
"
What are the results of the experiments in search of neutrinoless double beta decay?,"  Neutrinoless double beta decay is one of the most sensitive approaches in
non-accelerator particle physics to take us into a regime of physics beyond the
standard model. This article is a brief review of the experiments in search of
neutrinoless double beta decay from 76Ge. Following a brief introduction of the
process of double beta decay from 76Ge, the results of the very first
experiments IGEX and Heidelberg-Moscow which give indications of the existence
of possible neutrinoless double beta decay mode has been reviewed. Then ongoing
efforts to substantiate the early findings are presented and the Majorana
experiment as a future experimental approach which will allow a very detailed
study of the neutrinoless decay mode is discussed.
"
What are the possibilities of approximating the joint posterior law by separable laws?,"  In a non supervised Bayesian estimation approach for inverse problems in
imaging systems, one tries to estimate jointly the unknown image pixels $\fb$
and the hyperparameters $\thetab$. This is, in general, done through the joint
posterior law $p(\fb,\thetab|\gb)$. The expression of this joint law is often
very complex and its exploration through sampling and computation of the point
estimators such as MAP and posterior means need either optimization of non
convex criteria or int\'egration of non Gaussian and multi variate probability
laws. In any of these cases, we need to do approximations. We had explored
before the possibilities of Laplace approximation and sampling by MCMC. In this
paper, we explore the possibility of approximating this joint law by a
separable one in $\fb$ and in $\thetab$. This gives the possibility of
developing iterative algorithms with more reasonable computational cost, in
particular, if the approximating laws are choosed in the exponential conjugate
families. The main objective of this paper is to give details of different
algorithms we obtain with different choices of these families.
"
What is the new property of minimal surfaces in a ferromagnet with finite size?,"  The new property of minimal surfaces is obtained in this article.
"
What are the key factors that affect the accuracy of tracking and recognition algorithms?,"  Feature tracking and recognition are increasingly common tools for data
analysis, but are typically implemented on an ad-hoc basis by individual
research groups, limiting the usefulness of derived results when selection
effects and algorithmic differences are not controlled. Specific results that
are affected include the solar magnetic turnover time, the distributions of
sizes, strengths, and lifetimes of magnetic features, and the physics of both
small scale flux emergence and the small-scale dynamo. In this paper, we
present the results of a detailed comparison between four tracking codes
applied to a single set of data from SOHO/MDI, describe the interplay between
desired tracking behavior and parameterization of tracking algorithms, and make
recommendations for feature selection and tracking practice in future work.
"
What are the applications of Monte Carlo methods in Quantum Field Theory?,"  In these lecture notes some applications of Monte Carlo integration methods
in Quantum Field Theory - in particular in Quantum Chromodynamics - are
introduced and discussed.
"
What are the implications of the transit lightcurves for the size of the planet?,"  This Letter reports on the photometric detection of transits of the
Neptune-mass planet orbiting the nearby M-dwarf star GJ 436. It is by far the
closest, smallest and least massive transiting planet detected so far. Its mass
is slightly larger than Neptune's at M = 22.6 +- 1.9 M_earth. The shape and
depth of the transit lightcurves show that it is crossing the host star disc
near its limb (impact parameter 0.84 +- 0.03) and that the planet size is
comparable to that of Uranus and Neptune, R = 25200 +- 2200 km = 3.95 +- 0.35
R_earth. Its main constituant is therefore very likely to be water ice. If the
current planet structure models are correct, an outer layer of H/He
constituting up to ten percent in mass is probably needed on top of the ice to
account for the observed radius.
"
What are the implications of the mean ergodic theorem for amenable semigroup algebras?,"  In this paper, among other things, we state and prove the mean ergodic
theorem for amenable semigroup algebras.
"
What are the origins of the anisotropy of cosmic ray flow?,"  The study of the anisotropy of the arrival directions is an essential tool to
investigate the origin and propagation of cosmic rays primaries. A simple way
of recording many cosmic rays is to record coincidences between a number of
detectors. We have monitored multi-TeV cosmic rays by a small array of water
cherenkov detectors in Tehran(35 43 N, 51 20 E, 1200m a.s.l). More than
1.1*10^6 extensive air shower events were recorded. In addition to the Compton-
Getting effect due to the motion of the earth in the Galaxy, an anisotropy has
been observed which is due to a unidirectional anisotropy of cosmic ray flow
along the Galactic arms.
"
What is the relationship between the distribution of the increments of Sn and the heaviness of the tail of the distribution?,"  Let $R_n=\max_{0\leq j\leq n}S_j-S_n$ be a random walk $S_n$ reflected in its
maximum. Except in the trivial case when $P(X\ge0)=1$, $R_n$ will pass over a
horizontal boundary of any height in a finite time, with probability 1. We
extend this by giving necessary and sufficient conditions for finiteness of
passage times of $R_n$ above certain curved (power law) boundaries, as well.
The intuition that a degree of heaviness of the negative tail of the
distribution of the increments of $S_n$ is necessary for passage of $R_n$ above
a high level is correct in most, but not all, cases, as we show. Conditions are
also given for the finiteness of the expected passage time of $R_n$ above
linear and square root boundaries.
"
What is the classification of a family of 3-revolute (3R) positioning manipulators based on the topology of their workspace?,"  A classification of a family of 3-revolute (3R) positioning manipulators is
established. This classification is based on the topology of their workspace.
The workspace is characterized in a half-cross section by the singular curves
of the manipulator. The workspace topology is defined by the number of cusps
and nodes that appear on these singular curves. The design parameters space is
shown to be partitioned into nine subspaces of distinct workspace topologies.
Each separating surface is given as an explicit expression in the
DH-parameters.
"
What are the three different kinds of architectures that the algorithm can be applied to?,"  This paper proposes a novel algorithm for finding error-locators of
algebraic-geometric codes that can eliminate the division-calculations of
finite fields from the Berlekamp-Massey-Sakata algorithm. This inverse-free
algorithm provides full performance in correcting a certain class of errors,
generic errors, which includes most errors, and can decode codes on algebraic
curves without the determination of unknown syndromes. Moreover, we propose
three different kinds of architectures that our algorithm can be applied to,
and we represent the control operation of shift-registers and switches at each
clock-timing with numerical simulations. We estimate the performance in
comparison of the total running time and the numbers of multipliers and
shift-registers in three architectures with those of the conventional ones for
codes on algebraic curves.
"
What are the distinctive features of the core-shell structures of a diblock copolymer?,"  We investigate the folding transition of a single diblock copolymer
consisting of a semiflexible and a flexible block. We obtain a {\it
Saturn-shaped} core-shell conformation in the folded state, in which the
flexible block forms a core and the semiflexible block wraps around it. We
demonstrate two distinctive features of the core-shell structures: (i) The
kinetics of the folding transition in the copolymer are significantly more
efficient than those of a semiflexible homopolymer. (ii) The core-shell
structure does not depend on the transition pathway.
"
What is the compressibility of a graphene bilayer within the Hartree-Fock approximation?,"  We calculate the electronic compressibility arising from electron-electron
interactions for a graphene bilayer within the Hartree-Fock approximation. We
show that, due to the chiral nature of the particles in this system, the
compressibility is rather different from those of either the two-dimensional
electron gas or ordinary semiconductors. We find that an inherent competition
between the contributions coming from intra-band exchange interactions
(dominant at low densities) and inter-band interactions (dominant at moderate
densities) leads to a non-monotonic behavior of the compressibility as a
function of carrier density.
"
What are the asymptotic behavior of the modified action in the context of the Pioneer anomaly and the flat rotation curve of spiral galaxies?,"  We use metric formalism in $f(R)$ modified gravity to study the dynamics of
various systems from the solar system to the cosmological scale. we assume an
ansatz for the derivative of action as a function of distance and describe the
Pioneer anomaly and the flat rotation curve of the spiral galaxies. Having the
asymptotic behavior of action, we propose the action of $f(R) = (R + \Lambda)(1
+ \ln(R/R_c)/(R/R_0 + 2/\alpha))$ where in galactic and solar system scales it
can recover our desired form. The vacuum solution of this action also results
in a positive late time acceleration for the universe. We fix the parameters of
this model, comparing with the Pioneer anomaly, rotation curve of spiral
galaxies and Supernova Type Ia gold sample data.
"
How do the ultraviolet imaging of nearby shell galaxies reveal the presence of shells and fine structures?,"  We present the GALEX far FUV and near NUV ultraviolet imaging of three nearby
shell galaxies, namely NGC 2865, NGC 5018 and NGC 7135. The system of shells
and fine structures visible in the optical is detected in the NUV image of NGC
2865 and in both NUV and FUV images of NGC 7135. The NUV image of NGC 5018 does
not present shell structures. We detect absorption features in the nuclear
region of all three galaxies. NGC 2865 has a nearly flat colour profile with
(FUV-NUV)~2 throughout the whole galaxy. NGC 7135 is blue in the center
(FUV-NUV)~0 and as red as (FUV-NUV)~1.5 in the outskirts, including the faint
shell-like feature. We investigate the ability of the nuclear GALEX (FUV-NUV)
colour to provide information about rejuvenation phenomena in the stellar
populations of the shell galaxies. To this aim, we derive from theory the
relationship between the Mg2, Hbeta, HgammaA, HdeltaA Lick line-strength
indices and the (FUV-NUV) colour. We extend the study to a sample of early-type
galaxies with emission lines in their optical spectra (Annibali et al. 2007).
In the index vs.(FUV-NUV) colour diagrams, most of the galaxies are well
explained by passively evolving SSPs. On the average, ages and metallicities of
the galaxies in our sample estimated from optical line-strength indices are
consistent with those inferred from the (FUV-NUV) colour. In general, all the
colours but for (FUV-NUV) and (FUV-V), become nearly age insensitive when 1-2
Gyr have elapsed from the last star forming event. Considering composite
stellar population models with a recent burst of star formation, we suggest
that the position of the NGC 7135 and NGC 2865 nuclei in the (FUV-NUV)-Hbeta
plane could be explained in term of a recent rejuvenation episode. (Abridged)
"
What are the magnetic properties of the pseudo-ternary series Gd_xY_{1-x}Fe_2Zn_{20}?,"  Single crystals of the dilute, rare earth bearing, pseudo-ternary series,
Gd_xY_{1-x}Fe_2Zn_{20} were grown out of Zn-rich solution. Measurements of
magnetization, resistivity and heat capacity on Gd_xY_{1-x}Fe_2Zn_{20} samples
reveal ferromagnetic order of Gd^{3+} local moments across virtually the whole
series ($x \geq 0.02$). The magnetic properties of this series, including the
ferromagnetic ordering, the reduced saturated moments at base temperature, the
deviation of the susceptibilities from Curie-Weiss law and the anomalies in the
resistivity, are understood within the frame work of dilute, $\textbf {S}$
moments (Gd^{3+}) embedded in a nearly ferromagnetic Fermi liquid
(YFe_2Zn_{20}). The s-d model is employed to further explain the variation of
$T_{\mathrm{C}}$ with x as well as the temperature dependences of of the
susceptibilities.
"
What are the constraints that restrict the form that the function F(R) can take?,"  Modified gravity models are subject to a number of consistency requirements
which restrict the form that the function $F(R)$ can take. We study a
particular class of $F(R)$ functions which satisfy various constraints that
have been found in the literature. These models have a late time accelerating
epoch, and an acceptable matter era. We calculate the Friedmann equation for
our models, and show that in order to satisfy the constraints we impose, they
must mimic General Relativity plus $\Lambda$ throughout the cosmic history,
with exponentially suppressed corrections. We also find that the free
parameters in our model must be fine tuned to obtain an acceptable late time
accelerating phase. We discuss the generality of this conclusion.
"
What are the conditions for the detection of a terrestrial-size planet using the Rossiter effect?,"  We explore the possibility that the transit signature of an Earth-size planet
can be detected in spectroscopic velocity shifts via the Rossiter effect. Under
optimistic but not unrealistic conditions, it should be possible to detect a
large terrestrial-size planet. While not suitable for discovering planets, this
method can be used to confirm suspected planets.
"
What are the properties of the Galois representation of pi over a finite field K?,"  Let pi be a regular algebraic cuspidal automorphic representation of GL(2)
over an imaginary quadratic number field K such that the central character of
pi is invariant under the non-trivial automorphism of K. We show that pi is
associated with an l-adic Galois representation rho over K such that at each
prime of K outside an explicit finite set the Frobenius polynomial of rho
agrees with the Hecke polynomial of pi.
"
What is the relationship between the inverse Laplace transform of the Stieltjes function and the probability amplitude of observing the CTQW?,"  Continuous-time quantum walk (CTQW) on a given graph is investigated by using
the techniques of the spectral analysis and inverse Laplace transform of the
Stieltjes function (Stieltjes transform of the spectral distribution)
associated with the graph. It is shown that, the probability amplitude of
observing the CTQW at a given site at time $t$ is related to the inverse
Laplace transformation of the Stieltjes function, namely, one can calculate the
probability amplitudes only by taking the inverse laplace transform of the
function $iG_{\mu}(is)$, where $G_{\mu}(x)$ is the Stieltjes function of the
graph. The preference of this procedure is that, there is no any need to know
the spectrum of the graph
"
What is the acoustic wave used to measure the mechanical displacement of a nanoresonator in a NEMS?,"  The dream of every surfer is an extremely steep wave propagating at the
highest speed possible. The best waves for this would be shock waves, but are
very hard to surf. In the nanoscopic world the same is true: the surfers in
this case are electrons riding through nanomechanical devices on acoustic waves
[1]. Naturally, this has a broad range of applications in sensor technology and
for communication electronics for which the combination of an electronic and a
mechanical degree of freedom is essential. But this is also of interest for
fundamental aspects of nano-electromechanical systems (NEMS), when it comes to
quantum limited displacement detection [2] and the control of phonon number
states [3]. Here, we study the formation of shock waves in a NEMS resonator
with an embedded two-dimensional electron gas using surface acoustic waves. The
mechanical displacement of the nano-resonator is read out via the induced
acoustoelectric current. Applying acoustical standing waves we are able to
determine the anomalous acoustocurrent. This current is only found in the
regime of shock wave formation. We ontain very good agreement with model
calculations.
"
What is the value of |Vub| extracted from exclusive semileptonic B to pi decays?,"  We update the extraction of |Vub| from exclusive semileptonic B to pi decays,
combining experimental partial branching fraction information with theoretical
form factor calculations, using the recently revised HPQCD results for the form
factors f_+ and f_0. We use Omnes representations to provide the required
parametrisations of the form factors. The extracted value is 10^3 |Vub| =
3.47+/-0.29+/-0.03, in striking agreement with |Vub| extracted using all other
inputs in CKM fits and showing some disagreement with |Vub| extracted from
inclusive semileptonic B to pi decays.
"
What is the isospin-violating mixing of light scalar mesons a0(980) and f0(980) in the unitarized chiral approach?,"  We investigate the isospin-violating mixing of the light scalar mesons
a0(980) and f0(980) within the unitarized chiral approach. Isospin-violating
effects are considered to leading order in the quark mass differences and
electromagnetism. In this approach both mesons are generated through
meson-meson dynamics. Our results provide a description of the mixing
phenomenon within a framework consistent with chiral symmetry and unitarity,
where these resonances are not predominantly q q-bar states. Amongst the
possible experimental signals, we discuss observable consequences for the
reaction J/Psi -> phi pi0 eta in detail. In particular we demonstrate that the
effect of a0-f0 mixing is by far the most important isospin-breaking effect in
the resonance region and can indeed be extracted from experiment.
"
What are the properties of concave functions?,"  We explicitly solve the optimal switching problem for one-dimensional
diffusions by directly employing the dynamic programming principle and the
excessive characterization of the value function. The shape of the value
function and the smooth fit principle then can be proved using the properties
of concave functions.
"
What is the four-body interaction demonstrated in the quantum information processor?,"  Four-body interaction plays an important role in many-body systems, and it
can exhibit interesting phase transition behaviors. Historically it was the
need to efficiently simulate quantum systems that lead the idea of a quantum
computer. In this Letter, we report the experimental demonstration of a
four-body interaction in a four- qubit nuclear magnetic resonance quantum
information processor. The strongly modulating pulse is used to implement spin
selective excitation. The results show a good agreement between theory and
experiment.
"
What is the ZEUS detector used to measure the cross section for high-E_T dijet production in photoproduction?,"  The cross section for high-E_T dijet production in photoproduction has been
measured with the ZEUS detector at HERA using an integrated luminosity of 81.8
pb-1. The events were required to have a virtuality of the incoming photon,
Q^2, of less than 1 GeV^2 and a photon-proton centre-of-mass energy in the
range 142 < W < 293 GeV. Events were selected if at least two jets satisfied
the transverse-energy requirements of E_T(jet1) > 20 GeV and E_T(jet2) > 15 GeV
and pseudorapidity requirements of -1 < eta(jet1,2) < 3, with at least one of
the jets satisfying -1 < eta(jet) < 2.5. The measurements show sensitivity to
the parton distributions in the photon and proton and effects beyond
next-to-leading order in QCD. Hence these data can be used to constrain further
the parton densities in the proton and photon.
"
What is the eccentricity growth in the inner portions of a protoplanetary disc?,"  We present computational results showing eccentricity growth in the inner
portions of a protoplanetary disc. We attribute this to the evolving surface
density of the disc. The planet creates a gap, which adjusts the balance
between the 3:1 (eccentricity exciting) and 2:1 (eccentricity damping)
resonances. The eccentricity of the inner disc can rise as high as 0.3, which
is sufficient to cause it to be accreted onto the star. This offers an
alternative mechanism for producing the large holes observed in the discs of
CoKu Tau/4, GM Aur and DM Tau.
"
What are the two sectors in the Hamiltonian formulation of a massive gauge theory?,"  Abelian topologically massive gauge theories (TMGT) provide a topological
mechanism to generate mass for any p-tensor boson in any dimension. Within the
Hamiltonian formulation, the embedded topological field theory (TFT) is not
made manifest. We therefore introduce a gauge invariant factorization of the
classical phase space in two orthogonal sectors. The first of these sectors is
that of gauge invariant dynamical variables with massive excitations. The
second is that of a decoupled TFT. Through canonical quantization, a
factorization of quantum states arises, enabling the projection from TMGT onto
topological quantum field theories in a most transparent way.
"
What is the category of functors Fquad and the category of F2-vector spaces?,"  In this paper, we continue the study of the category of functors Fquad,
associated to F_2-vector spaces equipped with a nondegenerate quadratic form,
initiated in two previous papers of the author. We define a filtration of the
standard projective objects in Fquad; this refines to give a decomposition into
indecomposable factors of the two first standard projective objects in Fquad.
As an application of these two decompositions, we give a complete description
of the polynomial functors of the category Fquad.
"
surfaces and the non-commutative locally analytic p-adic groups?,"  We discuss examples of non-commutative spaces over non-archimedean fields.
Those include non-commutative and quantum affinoid algebras, quantized K3
surfaces and quantized locally analytic p-adic groups.
"
What is the theoretical framework of general relativity necessary to understand the relativistic effects around the Earth?,"  After a review of the chrono-geometrical structure of special relativity,
where the definition of the instantaneous 3-space is based on the
observer-dependent convention for the synchronization of distant clocks, it is
shown that in a class of models of general relativity the instantaneous 3-space
and the associated clock synchronization convention are dynamically determined
by Einstein's equations. This theoretical framework is necessary to understand
the relativistic effects around the Earth, to be tested with the ACES mission
of ESA, and the implications for metrology induced by the accuracy of the new
generation of atomic clocks.
"
What are the different q-factor definitions in the literature?,"  Different q-factor definitions are considered. The formula connecting
different q-factors is given. Also it is pointed the way to find all the
q-factors from experimental data.
"
What is the quantization condition for anharmonic oscillators?,"  We investigate symmetric oscillators, and in particular their quantization,
by employing semiclassical and quantum phase functions introduced in the
context of Liouville-Green transformations of the Schr\""{o}dinger equation. For
anharmonic oscillators, first order semiclassical quantization is seldom
accurate and the higher order expansions eventually break down given the
asymptotic nature of the series. A quantum phase that allows in principle to
retrieve the exact quantum mechanical quantization condition and wavefunctions
is given along with an iterative scheme to compute it. The arbitrariness
surrounding quantum phase functions is lifted by supplementing the phase with
boundary conditions involving high order semiclassical expansions. This allows
to extend the definition of oscillation numbers, that determine the
quantization of the harmonic oscillator, to the anharmonic case. Several
illustrations involving homogeneous as well as coupling constant dependant
anharmonic oscillators are given.
"
How does the molecular rovibronic states couple with the cavity modes in the proposed cooling scheme?,"  We present detailed calculations at the basis of our recent proposal for
simultaneous cooling the rotational, vibrational and external molecular degrees
of freedom. In this method, the molecular rovibronic states are coupled by an
intense laser and an optical cavity via coherent Raman processes enhanced by
the strong coupling with the cavity modes. For a prototype system, OH, we
showed that the translational motion is cooled to few micro Kelvin and the
molecule is brought to the internal ground state in about a second. Here, we
investigate numerically the dependence of the cooling scheme on the molecular
polarizability, selecting NO as a second example. Furthermore, we demonstrate
the general applicability of the proposed cooling scheme to initially
vibrationally and rotationally hot molecular systems.
"
What is the significance of the soft X-ray spectra and the presence of an independent soft component in the observation of GRO J1655$-$40?,"  The Galactic black-hole binary GRO J1655$-$40 was observed with Suzaku on
2005 September 22--23, for a net exposure of 35 ks with the X-ray Imaging
Spectrometer (XIS) and 20 ks with the Hard X-ray Detector (HXD). The source was
detected over a broad and continuous energy range of 0.7--300 keV, with an
intensity of $\sim$50 mCrab at 20 keV. At a distance of 3.2 kpc, the 0.7--300
keV luminosity is $ \sim 5.1 \times 10^{36}$ erg s$^{-1}$ ($\sim 0.7$ % of the
Eddington luminosity for a 6 $M_{\odot}$ black hole). The source was in a
typical low/hard state, exhibiting a power-law shaped continuum with a photon
index of $\sim 1.6$. During the observation, the source intensity gradually
decreased by 25% at energies above $\sim 3$ keV, and by 35% below 2 keV. This,
together with the soft X-ray spectra taken with the XIS, suggests the presence
of an independent soft component that can be represented by emission from a
cool ($\sim 0.2$ keV) disk. The hard X-ray spectra obtained with the HXD reveal
a high-energy spectral cutoff, with an e-folding energy of $\sim 200$ keV.
Since the spectral photon index above 10 keV is harder by $\sim 0.4$ than that
observed in the softer energy band, and the e-folding energy is higher than
those of typical reflection humps, the entire 0.7--300 keV spectrum cannot be
reproduced by a single thermal Comptonization model, even considering
reflection effects. Instead, the spectrum (except the soft excess) can be
successfully explained by invoking two thermal-Comptonization components with
different $y$-parameters. In contrast to the high/soft state spectra of this
object in which narrow iron absorption lines are detected with equivalent
widths of 60--100 eV, the present XIS spectra bear no such features beyond an
upper-limit equivalent width of 25 eV.
"
How do the mechanical properties of super carbon nanotubes vary with their chirality and radius?,"  The mechanical properties of the so-called `super' carbon nanotubes (STs) are
investigated using classical molecular dynamics simulations. The STs are built
from single walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) connected by Y-like junctions
forming an ordered carbon nanotube network that is then rolled into a seamless
cylinder. We observed that the ST behavior under tensile tests is similar to
the one presented by fishing nets. This interesting behavior provides a way to
vary the accessible channels to the inner parts of STs by applying external
mechanical load. The Young's modulus is dependent on the ST chirality and it
inversely varies with the ST radius. Smaller reduction of breaking strain
values due to temperature increase is predicted for zigzag STs compared to
SWCNTs. The results show that, for STs with radius ~ 5 nm, the junctions
between the constituent SWCNTs play an important role on the fracture process.
The Young's modulus and tensile strength were estimated for hierarchical
higher-order STs using scaling laws related to the ST fractal dimension. The
obtained mechanical properties suggest that STs may be used in the development

What is the soup of reacting finitary and discrete processes used to analyze fundamental mechanisms of primordial evolution?,"  A general and basic model of primordial evolution--a soup of reacting
finitary and discrete processes--is employed to identify and analyze
fundamental mechanisms that generate and maintain complex structures in
prebiotic systems. The processes--$\epsilon$-machines as defined in
computational mechanics--and their interaction networks both provide well
defined notions of structure. This enables us to quantitatively demonstrate
hierarchical self-organization in the soup in terms of complexity. We found
that replicating processes evolve the strategy of successively building higher
levels of organization by autocatalysis. Moreover, this is facilitated by local
components that have low structural complexity, but high generality. In effect,
the finitary process soup spontaneously evolves a selection pressure that
favors such components. In light of the finitary process soup's generality,
these results suggest a fundamental law of hierarchical systems: global
complexity requires local simplicity.
"
What are the selection criteria for selecting events in the analysis of ttbar pair production in ppbar collisions?,"  We present a measurement of the ttbar pair production cross section in ppbar
collisions at sqrt(s) = 1.96 TeV utilizing approximately 425 pb-1 of data
collected with the D0 detector. We consider decay channels containing two high
pT charged leptons (either e or \mu) from leptonic decays of both top-daughter
W bosons. These were gathered using four sets of selection criteria, three of
which required that a pair of fully identified leptons (i.e., e\mu, ee, or
\mu\mu) be found. The fourth approach imposed less restrictive criteria on one
of the lepton candidates and required that at least one hadronic jet in each
event be tagged as containing a b quark. For a top quark mass of 175 GeV, the
measured cross section is 7.4 +/-1.4(stat} +/- 1.0(syst) pb.

What are the challenges of expert elicitation in system design?,"  Comment: Expert Elicitation for Reliable System Design [arXiv:0708.0279]
"
What are the pseudorapidity requirements for the jets in the events selected for analysis?,"  The cross section for high-E_T dijet production in photoproduction has been
measured with the ZEUS detector at HERA using an integrated luminosity of 81.8
pb-1. The events were required to have a virtuality of the incoming photon,
Q^2, of less than 1 GeV^2 and a photon-proton centre-of-mass energy in the
range 142 < W < 293 GeV. Events were selected if at least two jets satisfied
the transverse-energy requirements of E_T(jet1) > 20 GeV and E_T(jet2) > 15 GeV
and pseudorapidity requirements of -1 < eta(jet1,2) < 3, with at least one of
the jets satisfying -1 < eta(jet) < 2.5. The measurements show sensitivity to
the parton distributions in the photon and proton and effects beyond
next-to-leading order in QCD. Hence these data can be used to constrain further
the parton densities in the proton and photon.
"
What are the collapsing spacetimes with negative cosmological constant and planar or hyperbolic symmetry?,"  We match collapsing inhomogeneous as well as spatially homogeneous but
anisotropic spacetimes to vacuum static exteriors with a negative cosmological
constant and planar or hyperbolic symmetry. The collapsing interiors include
the inhomogeneous solutions of Szekeres and of Barnes, which in turn include
the Lemaitre-Tolman and the McVittie solutions. The collapse can result in
toroidal or higher genus asymptotically AdS black holes.
"
What are the implications of the constraints on the deceleration parameter q(z) for the acceleration of the universe?,"  It has been widely shown that the cosmological parameters and dark energy can
be constrained by using data from type-Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), the cosmic
microwave background (CMB) anisotropy, the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO)
peak from Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), the X-ray gas mass fraction in
clusters, and the linear growth rate of perturbations at z=0.15 as obtained
from the 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey. Recently, gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) have
also been argued to be promising standard candles for cosmography. In this
paper, we present constraints on the cosmological parameters and dark energy by
combining a recent GRB sample including 69 events with the other cosmological
probes. First, we find that for the LambdaCDM cosmology this combination makes
the constraints stringent and the best fit is close to the flat universe.
Second, we fit the flat Cardassian expansion model and find that this model is
consistent with the LambdaCDM cosmology. Third, we present constraints on
several two-parameter dark energy models and find that these models are also
consistent with the LambdaCDM cosmology. Finally, we reconstruct the dark
energy equation-of-state parameter w(z) and the deceleration parameter q(z). We
see that the acceleration could have started at a redshift from
z_T=0.40_{-0.08}^{+0.14} to z_T=0.65_{-0.05}^{+0.10}. This difference in the
transition redshift is due to different dark energy models that we adopt. The
most stringent constraint on w(z) lies in the redshift range z\sim 0.3-0.6.
"
What is the theoretical framework for estimating the quantum vacuum energy?,"  It has been shown that an improved estimation of quantum vacuum energy can
yield not only acceptable but also experimentally sensible results. The very
idea consists in a straightforward extraction of gravitationally interacting
part of the full quantum vacuum energy by means of gauge transformations. The
implementation of the idea has been performed in the formalism of effective
action, in the language of Schwinger's proper time and the Seeley-DeWitt heat
kernel expansion, in the background of the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker geometry.
"
What is the relationship between the size distribution of the stability region around the Lagrange point L4 and the orbital eccentricity of the primaries?,"  The size distribution of the stability region around the Lagrangian point L4
is investigated in the elliptic restricted three-body problem as the function
of the mass parameter and the orbital eccentricity of the primaries. It is
shown that there are minimum zones in the size distribution of the stability
regions, and these zones are connected with secondary resonances between the
frequencies of librational motions around L4. The results can be applied to
hypothetical Trojan planets for predicting values of the mass parameter and the
eccentricity for which such objects can be expected or their existence is less
probable.
"
What is the current experimental evidence for or against pentaquarks?,"  The experimental evidence for pentaquarks is reviewed and compared with the
experiments that do not see any sign of pentaquarks. This paper is based on a
lecture given at the 33rd ITEP Winter School of Physics in the beginning of
2005. Results obtained since then are summarized in the epilogue.
"
What are the assumptions of linear control and unitary dynamics in the Pontryagin's Minimum Principle?,"  We study the optimal generation of entanglement between two qubits subject to
local unitary control. With the only assumptions of linear control and unitary
dynamics, by means of a numerical protocol based on the variational approach
(Pontryagin's Minimum Principle), we evaluate the optimal control strategy
leading to the maximal achievable entanglement in an arbitrary interaction
time, taking into account the energy cost associated to the controls. In our
model we can arbitrarily choose the relative weight between a large
entanglement and a small energy cost.
"
What is the energy density that can be attained in various quantum states of a massless scalar field?,"  We examine the maximum negative energy density which can be attained in
various quantum states of a massless scalar field. We consider states in which
either one or two modes are excited, and show that the energy density can be
given in terms of a small number of parameters. We calculate these parameters
for several examples of superposition states for one mode, and entangled states
for two modes, and find the maximum magnitude of the negative energy density in
these states. We consider several states which have been, or potentially will
be, generated in quantum optics experiments.
"
What is the $P$-dependence of the specific heat coefficient of the element?,"  We have carried out extensive low-temperature (1.5 to 10 K) measurements of
the critical field, $H_c$, for the element Pb up to a pressure of $P=1.2$ GPa.
  From this data the electronic entropy, specific heat, thermal expansion
coefficient and compressibility is calculated as a function of temperature,
pressure and magnetic field. The zero-field data is consistent with direct
thermodynamic measurements and the $P$-dependence of $T_c$ and specific heat
coefficient, $\gamma(T,P)$ allows the determination of the $P$-dependence of
the pairing interaction.
"
What are the products of the detonation of the 12C ignition layer on an accreting neutron star?,"  The strong degeneracy of the 12C ignition layer on an accreting neutron star
results in a hydrodynamic thermonuclear runaway, in which the nuclear heating
time becomes shorter than the local dynamical time. We model the resulting
combustion wave during these superbursts as an upward propagating detonation.
We solve the reactive fluid flow and show that the detonation propagates
through the deepest layers of fuel and drives a shock wave that steepens as it
travels upward into lower density material. The shock is sufficiently strong
upon reaching the freshly accreted H/He layer that it triggers unstable 4He
burning if the superburst occurs during the latter half of the regular Type I
bursting cycle; this is likely the origin of the bright Type I precursor bursts
observed at the onset of superbursts. The cooling of the outermost shock-heated
layers produces a bright, ~0.1s, flash that precedes the Type I burst by a few
seconds; this may be the origin of the spike seen at the burst onset in 4U
1820-30 and 4U 1636-54, the only two bursts observed with RXTE at high time
resolution. The dominant products of the 12C detonation are 28Si, 32S, and
36Ar. Gupta et al. showed that a crust composed of such intermediate mass
elements has a larger heat flux than one composed of iron-peak elements and
helps bring the superburst ignition depth into better agreement with values
inferred from observations.
"
What are the phenomenological implications of the decays of a Tau into three charged leptons in a generic way?,"  Many models for physics beyond the Standard Model predict lepton-flavour
violating decays of charged leptons at a level which may become observable very
soon. In the present paper we investigate the decays of a Tau into three
charged leptons in a generic way, based on effective-field-theory methods,
where the relevant operators are classified according to their chirality
structure. We work out the decay distributions and discuss phenomenological
implications.
"
What are the allowed shapes of vesicles with narrow necks in the presence of molecular-tilt order?,"  Can the presence of molecular-tilt order significantly affect the shapes of
lipid bilayer membranes, particularly membrane shapes with narrow necks?
Motivated by the propensity for tilt order and the common occurrence of narrow
necks in the intermediate stages of biological processes such as endocytosis
and vesicle trafficking, we examine how tilt order inhibits the formation of
necks in the equilibrium shapes of vesicles. For vesicles with a spherical
topology, point defects in the molecular order with a total strength of $+2$
are required. We study axisymmetric shapes and suppose that there is a
unit-strength defect at each pole of the vesicle. The model is further
simplified by the assumption of tilt isotropy: invariance of the energy with
respect to rotations of the molecules about the local membrane normal. This
isotropy condition leads to a minimal coupling of tilt order and curvature,
giving a high energetic cost to regions with Gaussian curvature and tilt order.
Minimizing the elastic free energy with constraints of fixed area and fixed
enclosed volume determines the allowed shapes. Using numerical calculations, we
find several branches of solutions and identify them with the branches
previously known for fluid membranes. We find that tilt order changes the
relative energy of the branches, suppressing thin necks by making them costly,
leading to elongated prolate vesicles as a generic family of tilt-ordered
membrane shapes.
"
What are the ions that are deflected by a bent crystal shield with a 1x1 cm2 surface area?,"  A bent crystal shield which is capable of deflecting cosmic radiation ions of
all atomic numbers away from spacecraft using the ion channeling effect is
described. Its effect on the transmitted angular distribution of heavy,
high-energy ions is characterized using Monte Carlo channeling simulations.
Ions up to an energy limit set by the bent crystal curvature radius are
deflected by the full curvature angle. A bent crystal shield with a 1 x 1 cm2
surface area capable of deflecting such ions with energies up to 100
GeV/nucleon is fabricated in which the lattice planes across the entrance
surface are uniformly aligned.
"
What are the conditions for Willems' conjecture to hold for a block B of G?,"  Let $G$ be a finite group and $N$ be a normal subgroup of $G$. Let
$J=J(F[N])$ denote the Jacboson radical of $F[N]$ and $I={\rm Ann}(J)=\{\alpha
\in F[G]|J\alpha =0\}$. We have another algebra $F[G]/I$. We study the
decomposition of Cartan matrix of $F[G]$ according to $F[G/N]$ and $F[G]/I$.
This decomposition establishs some connections between Cartan invariants and
chief composition factors of $G$. We find that existing zero-defect $p$-block
in $N$ depends on the properties of $I$ in $F[G]$ or Cartan invariants. When we
consider the Cartan invariants for a block algebra $B$ of $G$, the
decomposition is related to what kind of blocks in $N$ covered by $B$. We
mainly consider a block $B$ of $G$ which covers a block $b$ of $N$ with
$l(b)=1$. In two cases, we prove Willems' conjecture holds for these blocks,
which covers some true cases by Holm and Willems. Furthermore We give an
affirmative answer to a question by Holm and Willems in our cases. Some other
results about Cartan invariants are presented in our paper.
"
What is the relationship between quantum expectation values of subsystem observables and ergodic properties in a nonlinear system?,"  Using a model Hamiltonian for a single-mode electromagnetic field interacting
with a nonlinear medium, we show that quantum expectation values of subsystem
observables can exhibit remarkably diverse ergodic properties even when the
dynamics of the total system is regular. The time series of the mean photon
number is studied over a range of values of the ratio of the strength $\gamma$
of the nonlinearity to that of the inter-mode coupling $g$. We obtain the power
spectrum, estimate the embedding dimension of the reconstructed phase space and
the maximal Liapunov exponent $\lambda_{\rm max}$, and find the recurrence-time
distribution of the coarse-grained dynamics. The dynamical behavior ranges from
quasiperiodicity (for $\gamma/g \ll 1$) to chaos as characterized by
$\lambda_{\rm max} > 0$ (for $\gamma/g \gtrsim 1$), and is interpreted.
"
How does the MIR dust-to-star ratio differ between early-type and late-type galaxies?,"  We explore the correlation between morphological types and mid-infrared (MIR)
properties of an optically flux-limited sample of 154 galaxies from the Forth
Data Release (DR4) of Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), cross-correlated with
Spitzer SWIRE (Spitzer Wide-Area InfraRed Extragalactic Survey) fields of
ELAIS-N1, ELAIS-N2 and Lockman Hole. Aperture photometry is performed on the
SDSS and Spitzer images to obtain optical and MIR properties. The morphological
classifications are given based on both visual inspection and bulge-disk
decomposition on SDSS g- and r-band images. The average bulge-to-total ratio
(B/T) is a smooth function over different morphological types. Both the
8um(dust) and 24um(dust) luminosities and their relative luminosity ratios to
3.6um (MIR dust-to-star ratios) present obvious correlations with both the
Hubble T-type and B/T. The early-type galaxies notably differ from the
late-types in the MIR properties, especially in the MIR dust-to-star ratios. It
is suggested that the MIR dust-to-star ratio is an effective way to separate
the early-type galaxies from the late-type ones. Based on the tight correlation
between the stellar mass and the 3.6um luminosity, we have derived a formula to
calculate the stellar mass from the latter. We have also investigated the MIR
properties of both edge-on galaxies and barred galaxies in our sample. Since
they present similar MIR properties to the other sample galaxies, they do not
influence the MIR properties obtained for the entire sample.
"
What are the spacetimes on which state-dependent bounds cannot be evaluated?,"  Quantum Weak Energy Inequalities (QWEIs) are results which limit the extent
to which the smeared renormalised energy density of a quantum field can be
negative. On globally hyperbolic spacetimes the massive quantum Dirac field is
known to obey a QWEI in terms of a reference state chosen arbitrarily from the
class of Hadamard states; however, there exist spacetimes of interest on which
state-dependent bounds cannot be evaluated. In this paper we prove the first
QWEI for the massive quantum Dirac field on four dimensional globally
hyperbolic spacetime in which the bound depends only on the local geometry;
such a QWEI is known as an absolute QWEI.
"
What is the metastable liquid state spinodal decomposition method used to synthesize Fe40Ni40P14B6 alloys?,"  Nanostructured Fe40Ni40P14B6 alloys ingots of diameter 3~5 mm could be
synthesised by a metastable liquid state spinodal decomposition method. The
molten Fe40Ni40P14B6 alloy was purified by means of the fluxing technique and
thus a large undercooling could be achieved. For undercooling Delta T > 260 K,
the microstructure of the undercooled specimen had exhibited liquid state
spinodal decomposition in the undercooled liquid state. The microstructure
could be described as two intertwining networks with small grains dispersed in
them. For undercooling Delta T > 290 K, the overall microstructure of the
specimen changed into a granular morphology. The average grain sizes of the
small and large grains are ~ 30 nm and ~ 80 nm, respectively. These prepared
samples are soft magnets with saturation magnetization Bs ~0.744 T.
"
What are the Stokes and anti-Stokes sidebands observed in the trion spectral hole?,"  High-resolution spectral hole burning (SHB) in coherent nondegenerate
differential transmission spectroscopy discloses spin-trion dynamics in an
ensemble of negatively charged quantum dots. In the Voigt geometry, stimulated
Raman spin coherence gives rise to Stokes and anti-Stokes sidebands on top of
the trion spectral hole. The prominent feature of an extremely narrow spike at
zero detuning arises from spin population pulsation dynamics. These SHB
features confirm coherent electron spin dynamics in charged dots, and the
linewidths reveal spin spectral diffusion processes.
"
What is the time complexity of this algorithm?,"  We show how to test whether a graph with n vertices and m edges is a partial
cube, and if so how to find a distance-preserving embedding of the graph into a
hypercube, in the near-optimal time bound O(n^2), improving previous O(nm)-time
solutions.
"
What are the methods used for object discrimination in the Nearby Supernova Factory?,"  We present the results of applying new object classification techniques to
difference images in the context of the Nearby Supernova Factory supernova
search. Most current supernova searches subtract reference images from new
images, identify objects in these difference images, and apply simple threshold
cuts on parameters such as statistical significance, shape, and motion to
reject objects such as cosmic rays, asteroids, and subtraction artifacts.
Although most static objects subtract cleanly, even a very low false positive
detection rate can lead to hundreds of non-supernova candidates which must be
vetted by human inspection before triggering additional followup. In comparison
to simple threshold cuts, more sophisticated methods such as Boosted Decision
Trees, Random Forests, and Support Vector Machines provide dramatically better
object discrimination. At the Nearby Supernova Factory, we reduced the number
of non-supernova candidates by a factor of 10 while increasing our supernova
identification efficiency. Methods such as these will be crucial for
maintaining a reasonable false positive rate in the automated transient alert
pipelines of upcoming projects such as PanSTARRS and LSST.
"
What is the theory of mapping class groups in the context of Lagrangian embeddings?,"  A proof of non-existence of Lagrangian embeddings of the Klein bottle K in
\CP^2 is given. We exploit the existence of a special embedding of K in a
symplectic Lefschetz pencil on \CP^2 and study its monodromy. As the main
technical tool, we develop the theory of mapping class groups, considered as
quotients of special Artin braid groups, and obtain some new results about
combinatorial structure of such groups.
"
What are the implications of the variability and spectral properties of the X-ray sources in M33?,"  In this paper we investigate the X-ray spectra and X-ray spectral variability
of compact X-ray sources for 3 Chandra observations of the Local Group galaxy
M33. The observations are centered on the nucleus and the star forming region
NGC 604. In the observations 261 sources have been detected. For a total of 43
sources the number of net counts is above 100, sufficient for a more detailed
spectral fitting. Of these sources, 25 have been observed in more than one
observation, allowing the study of spectral variability on ~months timescales.
A quarter of the sources are found to be variable between observations.
However, except for two foreground sources, no source is variable within any
observation above the 99% confidence level. Only six sources show significant
spectral variability between observations. A comparison of N_H values with HI
observations shows that X-ray absorption values are consistent with Galactic
X-ray binaries and most sources in M33 are intrinsically absorbed. The pattern
of variability and the spectral parameters of these sources are consistent with
the M33 X-ray source population being dominated by X-ray binaries: Two thirds
of the 43 bright sources have spectral and timing properties consistent with
X-ray binaries; we also find two candidates for super-soft sources and two
candidates for quasi-soft sources.
"
What is the effect of intermolecular interactions on molecular conduction properties in junctions of molecules?,"  Current experimental and theoretical studies on the effect of intermolecular
interactions on molecular conduction appear to be in conflict with each other.
In particular, some experimental results, e.g., the observation of
2-dimensional free-particle character for interface bound electrons indicate
strong intermolecular interactions while other observations indicate an
additive character of conduction properties. In this paper we use a generic
tight binding model with a physically motivated choice of parameters in order
to examine this issue. The model encompasses direct intermolecular interactions
as well as through-metal interactions and can be solved exactly to yield
spectral properties (surface density of states) and transport characteristics
(transmission coefficients and current-voltage behaviors) for single molecule
junctions, molecular islands and molecular layers. We find linear scaling of
conduction properties with the number of conducting molecules in junctions
characterized by molecular layers when the probe (STM tip) addresses different
numbers of molecules; however, the conduction per molecule can differ
significantly from that of an isolated single molecule. When a junction
involves finite molecular islands of varying sizes, linear scaling sets in only
beyond a certain molecular island size, of the order of a few tens of
molecules. Implications for current observation of linear scaling behaviors are
discussed.
"
How are educational actors (instructional designers and tutors) using ICTs in,"  According to socio-constructivism approach, collective situations are
promoted to favor learning in classroom, at a distance or in a blended
educational context. So, many Information and Communication Technologies (ICT)
are provided to teachers but there are no clear studies about the way they are
used and perceived. Our research is based on the hypothesis that practices of
educational actors (instructional designers and tutors) are far away from
theoretical results of research in education technologies. In this paper, we
consider a precise kind of situation: Instrumented Collective Learning
Situations (ICLS). By a survey on 13 fields in higher education in France,
Switzerland and Canada, we present how ICLS are designed and how teachers used
them. Conclusions give an indication on the gap between the way information
technologies are prescribed and the way they are actually used and perceived by
teachers.
"
What are the basic physical properties of the supernova ejecta determined by the spectral fits?,"  We present spectral fits to five epochs of the typical Type Ib supernova
1999dn using the generalized, non-LTE, stellar atmospheres code PHOENIX. Our
goal is threefold: to determine basic physical properties of the supernova
ejecta, such as velocity, temperature, and density gradients; to reproduce He I
absorption lines by invoking non-thermal excitation; and, to investigate
possible spectral signatures of hydrogen, especially a feature around 6200
Angstrom, which has been attributed to high velocity $H_\alpha$. Our models
assume an atmosphere with uniform composition devoid of any hydrogen. Our model
spectra fit the observed spectra well, successfully reproducing most of the
features, including the prominent He I absorptions. The most plausible
alternative to $H_\alpha$ as the source of the 6200 Angstrom feature is a blend
of Fe II and Si II lines, which can be made stronger to fit the observed
feature better by increasing the metallicity of the ejecta. High-metallicity
models fit well at early epochs, but not as well as solar-metallicity models
after maximum light. While this blend of metal lines is a reasonable
explanation of the source of the 6200 Angstrom feature, it is still important
to investigate hydrogen as the source; therefore, a second paper will present
models that include a thin shell of hydrogen around the main composition
structure.
"
What are the constraints on possible structures of mass matrices in the quark sector?,"  We obtain constraints on possible structures of mass matrices in the quark
sector by using as experimental restrictions the determined values of the quark
masses at the $M_Z$ energy scale, the magnitudes of the quark mixing matrix
elements $V_{\rm ud}$, $V_{\rm us}$, $V_{\rm cd}$, and $V_{\rm cs}$, and the
Jarlskog invariant $J(V)$. Different cases of specific mass matrices are
examined in detail. The quality of the fits for the Fritzsch and Stech type
mass matrices is about the same with $\chi^2/{\rm dof}=4.23/3=1.41$ and
$\chi^2/{\rm dof}=9.10/4=2.28$, respectively. The fit for a simple
generalization (one extra parameter) of the Fritzsch type matrices, in the
physical basis, is much better with $\chi^2/{\rm dof}=1.89/4=0.47$. For
comparison we also include the results using the quark masses at the 2 GeV
energy scale. The fits obtained at this energy scale are similar to that at
$M_Z$ energy scale, implying that our results are unaffected by the evolution
of the quark masses from 2 to 91 GeV.
"
Can isospectrality be used to define a class of domains with the same S/E ratio?,"  In this letter it is proposed to study the Bekenstein's $\xi(4)$ calculation
of the $S/E$ bound for more general geometries. It is argued that, using some
relations among eigenvalues obtained in the context of Spectral Geometry, it is
possible to estimate $\xi(4)$ without an exact analytical knowledge of the
spectrum. Finally it is claimed that isospectrality can define a class of
domains with the same ratio $S/E$.
"
What is the Schwinger pair production rate calculated using the Liouville-von Neumann method?,"  In scalar QED we study the Schwinger pair production from an initial ensemble
of charged bosons when an electric field is turned on for a finite period
together with or without a constant magnetic field. The scalar QED Hamiltonian
depends on time through the electric field, which causes the initial ensemble
of bosons to evolve out of equilibrium. Using the Liouville-von Neumann method
for the density operator and quantum states for each momentum mode, we
calculate the Schwinger pair-production rate at finite temperature, which is
the pair-production rate from the vacuum times a thermal factor of the
Bose-Einstein distribution.
"
What is the evolution of the supernova within the circumstellar medium during the first 25 years?,"  We study the structure of the circumstellar medium surrounding SN 1987A in
the equatorial plane. Furthermore, we study the evolution of the SN shock
within this medium during the first 25 years, and the resulting hard X-ray and
radio emission from the remnant.
"
What are the geometric and dynamical properties of Markov systems?,"  We describe the geometric and dynamical properties of expansive Markov
systems.
"
Can $\gamma$-rays from dark matter annihilation in subhalos of the Milky Way be detected by satellite-based experiments?,"  In this paper we study the detectability of $\gamma$-rays from dark matter
annihilation in the subhalos of the Milky Way by the satellite-based
experiments, EGRET and GLAST. We work in the frame of supersymmetric extension
of the standard model and assume the lightest neutralino being the dark matter
particles. Based on the N-body simulation of the evolution of dark matter
subhalos we first calculate the average intensity distribution of this new
class of $\gamma$-ray sources by neutralino annihilation. It is possible to
detect these $\gamma$-ray sources by EGRET and GLAST. Conversely, if these
sources are not detected the nature of the dark matter particls will be
constrained by these experiments, which, however, depending on the
uncertainties of the subhalo profile.
"
What is the differential encoding/decoding setup introduced by Kiran et al. used for wireless relay networks?,"  The differential encoding/decoding setup introduced by Kiran et al, Oggier et
al and Jing et al for wireless relay networks that use codebooks consisting of
unitary matrices is extended to allow codebooks consisting of scaled unitary
matrices. For such codebooks to be used in the Jing-Hassibi protocol for
cooperative diversity, the conditions that need to be satisfied by the relay
matrices and the codebook are identified. A class of previously known rate one,
full diversity, four-group encodable and four-group decodable Differential
Space-Time Codes (DSTCs) is proposed for use as Distributed DSTCs (DDSTCs) in
the proposed set up. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first known low
decoding complexity DDSTC scheme for cooperative wireless networks.
"
How does Simon's model address the prediction of the detailed shape of Zipf's rank plots?,"  We address the role of multiplicative stochastic processes in modeling the
occurrence of power-law city size distributions. As an explanation of the
result of Zipf's rank analysis, Simon's model is presented in a mathematically
elementary way, with a thorough discussion of the involved hypotheses. Emphasis
is put on the flexibility of the model, as to its possible extensions and the
relaxation of some strong assumptions. We point out some open problems
regarding the prediction of the detailed shape of Zipf's rank plots, which may
be tackled by means of such extensions.
"
What is the Pauli-Fierz model of nonrelativistic quantum electrodynamics relevant to the infinite volume limit?,"  We investigate Gibbs measures relative to Brownian motion in the case when
the interaction energy is given by a double stochastic integral. In the case
when the double stochastic integral is originating from the Pauli-Fierz model
in nonrelativistic quantum electrodynamics, we prove the existence of its
infinite volume limit.
"
What are the roles of low order `boxlets' in galactic models?,"  We investigate the dynamics in the logarithmic galactic potential with an
analytical approach. The phase-space structure of the real system is
approximated with resonant detuned normal forms constructed with the method
based on the Lie transform. Attention is focused on the properties of the axial
periodic orbits and of low order `boxlets' that play an important role in
galactic models. Using energy and ellipticity as parameters, we find analytical
expressions of several useful indicators, such as stability-instability
thresholds, bifurcations and phase-space fractions of some orbit families and
compare them with numerical results available in the literature.
"
What is the recursion relation for the n order path PDF?,"  In random walks, the path representation of the Green's function is an
infinite sum over the length of path probability density functions (PDFs). Here
we derive and solve, in Laplace space, the recursion relation for the n order
path PDF for any arbitrarily inhomogeneous semi-Markovian random walk in a
one-dimensional (1D) chain of L states. The recursion relation relates the n
order path PDF to L/2 (round towards zero for an odd L) shorter path PDFs, and
has n independent coefficients that obey a universal formula. The z transform
of the recursion relation straightforwardly gives the generating function for
path PDFs, from which we obtain the Green's function of the random walk, and
derive an explicit expression for any path PDF of the random walk. These
expressions give the most detailed description of arbitrarily inhomogeneous
semi-Markovian random walks in 1D.
"
What is the theory of optical dispersive shocks in photorefractive media?,"  The theory of optical dispersive shocks generated in propagation of light
beams through photorefractive media is developed. Full one-dimensional
analytical theory based on the Whitham modulation approach is given for the
simplest case of sharp step-like initial discontinuity in a beam with
one-dimensional strip-like geometry. This approach is confirmed by numerical
simulations which are extended also to beams with cylindrical symmetry. The
theory explains recent experiments where such dispersive shock waves have been
observed.

What are the implications of the Entropy Penalized Method and the decay of correlation for this process?,"  This paper has been withdrawn since its content is included in the more
general version arXiv:0804.1882

How to use strong Rydberg dipole-dipole interactions to induce non-trivial conditional dynamics in individual-atom systems and mesoscopic ensembles?,"  We suggest a novel way to use strong Rydberg dipole-dipole interactions in
order to induce non-trivial conditional dynamics in individual-atom systems and
mesoscopic ensembles. Contrary to previous works, we suggest to excite atoms
into different Rydberg states, which results in a potentially richer dynamical
behaviour. Specifically, we investigate systems of individual hydrogen-like
atoms or mesoscopic ensembles excited into high-lying hydrogen-like s, p or d
states and show how to perform three-qubit conditional dynamics on the
information they contain through a proper use of dipole-dipole interaction
induced energy shifts.
"
What is the structural effect of the external pressure on the SHG susceptibility tensor?,"  The present work performs full bandstructure calculations to investigate the
structural effect and the transition mechanisms of the second harmonic
generation (SHG) susceptibility of the $\alpha-LiIO_{3}$ crystal. The anomalous
inconsistency of associated experimental data of the SHG susceptibility tensor
is elucidated to be dominated by the structural effect especially on the
topology of $O$-atoms. On the manipulation of the structural effect, the
modification of SHG susceptibility using an external pressure is simulated. The
calculations of SHG susceptibility tensor are completed at finite frequencies
and the static limit. The comparison with the experiments is also incorporated.
On the analysis of the transition mechanisms, the inter-band transition is
determined to entirely dominate the whole SHG susceptibility at the static
limit; however, the effect of the intra-band motion is revealed to be as
important as that of the inter-band transition at finite frequencies.
"
What are the generalized-ensemble algorithms for simulating complex systems in the canonical ensemble?,"  Conventional simulations of complex systems in the canonical ensemble suffer
from the quasi-ergodicity problem. A simulation in generalized ensemble
overcomes this difficulty by performing a random walk in potential energy space
and other parameter space. From only one simulation run, one can obtain
canonical-ensemble averages of physical quantities as functions of temperature
by the single-histogram and/or multiple-histogram reweighting techniques. In
this article we review the generalized-ensemble algorithms. Three well-known
methods, namely, multicanonical algorithm, simulated tempering, and
replica-exchange method, are described first. Both Monte Carlo and molecular
dynamics versions of the algorithms are given. We then present further
extensions of the above three methods.
"
What are the molecular abundances of several species of interest constrained by the ages of the dense globules in the Southern Coalsack?,"  We demonstrate how the observed H2O ice column densities toward three dense
globules in the Southern Coalsack could be used to constrain the ages of these
sources. We derive ages of ~10^5 yr, in agreement with dynamical studies of
these objects. We have modelled the chemical evolution of the globules, and
show how the molecular abundances are controlled by both the gas density and
the initial chemical conditions as the globules formed. Based on our derived
ages, we predict the column densities of several species of interest. These
predictions should be straightforward to test by performing molecular line
observations
"
What is the sign of the Boer-Mulders function in quarks in nucleons and other hadrons?,"  Chirally odd generalized parton distributions (GPDs) and the Boer-Mulders
function provide valuable information about spin-orbit correlations for quarks
in nucleons and other hadrons. We compare results for the relevant GPD
$\bar{E}^q_T$ from a variety of phenomenological models as well as recent
lattice results. We find that $\bar{E}^q_T>0$ for nucleons as well as the pion
and for both $u$ and $d$ quark. As a result, the corresponding Boer Mulders
functions are all expected to be negative. The sign of $\bar{E}^q_T$ arises
from the relative sign between the upper and lower Dirac components for the
quark wave functions.
"
What is the heavy ion program of the CMS experiment?,"  The heavy ion program of the CMS experiment will examine the QCD matter under
extreme conditions, through the study of global observables and specific
probes.
"
What are the twisted sectors of the Z_3xZ_3 orbifold on the E_6 root lattice?,"  We classify N=1 orbifolds on the E_6 root lattice and investigate explicit
model constructions on the Z_3xZ_3 orbifold in heterotic string theory.
Interestingly some of the twisted sectors from the Z_3xZ_3 orbifold on the E_6
root lattice have just three fixed tori respectively, and generate three
degenerate massless states. We also found three point functions with flavor
mixing terms. We assume only non-standard gauge embeddings and find that they
lead to three-family SU(5) and SO(10) GUT-like models. These models also
include strongly coupled sectors in the low energy and messenger states charged
with both hidden and visible sectors.
"
What is the role of the QCD sum rules in constraining the scalar and vector mean fields in the model?,"  A previously introduced relativistic energy density functional, successfully
applied to ordinary nuclei, is extended to hypernuclei. The density-dependent
mean field and the spin-orbit potential are consistently calculated for a
$\Lambda$ hyperon in the nucleus using the SU(3) extension of in-medium chiral
perturbation theory. The leading long range $\Lambda N$ interaction arises from
kaon-exchange and $2\pi$-exchange with $\Sigma$ hyperon in the intermediate
state. Scalar and vector mean fields reflecting in-medium changes of the quark
condensates are constrained by QCD sum rules. The model, applied to oxygen as a
test case, describes spectroscopic data in good agreement with experiment. In
particular, the smallness of the $\Lambda$ spin-orbit interaction finds a
natural explanation in terms of an almost complete cancellation between
scalar-vector background contributions and long-range terms generated by
two-pion exchange.
"
What are the thermal conductivity and thermoelectric coefficient of a strongly interacting 2+1 dimensional conformal field theories with anti-de Sitter space duals?,"  We calculate the electrical and thermal conductivities and the thermoelectric
coefficient of a class of strongly interacting 2+1 dimensional conformal field
theories with anti-de Sitter space duals. We obtain these transport
coefficients as a function of charge density, background magnetic field,
temperature and frequency. We show that the thermal conductivity and
thermoelectric coefficient are determined by the electrical conductivity alone.
At small frequency, in the hydrodynamic limit, we are able to provide a number
of analytic formulae for the electrical conductivity. A dominant feature of the
conductivity is the presence of a cyclotron pole. We show how bulk
electromagnetic duality acts on the transport coefficients.
"
What is the spin polarization in silicon obtained after the improvement of the injection efficiency?,"  Efficient injection of spin-polarized electrons into the conduction band of
silicon is limited by the formation of a silicide at the ferromagnetic metal
(FM)/silicon interface. In the present work, this ""magnetically-dead"" silicide
(where strong spin-scattering significantly reduces injected spin polarization)
is eliminated by moving the FM in the spin injector from the tunnel junction
base anode to the emitter cathode and away from the silicon surface. This
results in over an order-of-magnitude increase in spin injection efficiency,
from a previously-reported magnetocurrent ratio of ~2% to ~35% and an estimated
spin polarization in Si from ~1% to at least ~15%. The injector tunnel-junction
bias dependence of this spin transport signal is also measured, demonstrating
the importance of low bias voltage to preserve high injected spin polarization.
"
How do the Nernst effect measurements on the optimally doped samples relate to the pseudogap temperature T*?,"  In NdBa_2[Cu_{1-y}Ni_y]_3O_{7-\delta}, magnetic Ni-impurities suppress Tc but
at the same time the pseudogap is strongly enhanced. This unique feature makes
it an ideal system to study possible relations between the anomalous Nernst
effect, superconductivity and the pseudogap. We present Nernst effect
measurements on a series of optimally doped (O_7) and underdoped (O_{6.8})
samples with Ni contents ranging from y=0 to 0.12. In all samples an onset of
the Nernst signal is found at T^\nu > Tc. For the optimally doped samples T^\nu
and Tc decrease simultaneously with increasing Ni content. The underdoped
samples show a different behavior, i.e. the onset of the Nernst signal is
hardly affected by increasing the Ni content from y=0 to 0.03. Irrespective of
the oxygen content, T^\nu clearly does not track the enhanced pseudogap
temperature T*.
"
What are the key aspects of the model in the context of cosmology?,"  A new class of cylindrically symmetric inhomogeneous string cosmological
models is investigated. To get the deterministic solution, it has been assumed
that the expansion ($\theta$) in the model is proportional to the eigen value
$\sigma^{1}_{1}$ of the shear tensor $\sigma^{i}_{j}$. The physical and
geometric aspects of the model are also discussed.
"
What is the Euler equation in stellar physics?,"  The Euler equation has been accepted as the basic postulate of stellar
physics long before the plasma physics was developed. The existence of
electrical interaction between particles of interstellar plasma poses the
question, how this interaction must be accounted for. We argue that the right
way is in formulation of a new postulate. On the base of the new postulate, the
theory of a hot star interior is developed. Using this theory we obtain the
distribution of stars over their masses and mass-radius, mass-temperature and
mass-luminosity dependencies. The theory of the apsidal rotation of binary
stars and the spectrum of solar oscillation is considered. All these
theoretical predictions are in a good agreement with the known measurement
data, which confirms the validity of this consideration.
"
What is the large time scale separation induced by the introduction of a different monomer size?,"  We present molecular dynamics simulations on the structural relaxation of a
simple bead-spring model for polymer blends. The introduction of a different
monomer size induces a large time scale separation for the dynamics of the two
components. Simulation results for a large set of observables probing density
correlations, Rouse modes, and orientations of bond and chain end-to-end
vectors, are analyzed within the framework of the Mode Coupling Theory (MCT).
An unusually large value of the exponent parameter is obtained. This feature
suggests the possibility of an underlying higher-order MCT scenario for dynamic
arrest.
"
What are the conditions for the change point estimation of the telegraph process?,"  The telegraph process models a random motion with finite velocity and it is
usually proposed as an alternative to diffusion models. The process describes
the position of a particle moving on the real line, alternatively with constant
velocity $+ v$ or $-v$. The changes of direction are governed by an homogeneous
Poisson process with rate $\lambda >0.$ In this paper, we consider a change
point estimation problem for the rate of the underlying Poisson process by
means of least squares method. The consistency and the rate of convergence for
the change point estimator are obtained and its asymptotic distribution is
derived. Applications to real data are also presented.
"
What are the key factors involved in the switch between latency I and III in EBV?,"  The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infects more than 90% of the human population,
and is the cause of several both serious and mild diseases. It is a
tumorivirus, and has been widely studied as a model system for gene
(de)regulation in human. A central feature of the EBV life cycle is its ability
to persist in human B cells in states denoted latency I, II and III. In latency
III the host cell is driven to cell proliferation and hence expansion of the
viral population, but does not enter the lytic pathway, and no new virions are
produced, while the latency I state is almost completely dormant. In this paper
we study a physico-chemical model of the switch between latency I and latency
III in EBV. We show that the unusually large number of binding sites of two
competing transcription factors, one viral and one from the host, serves to
make the switch sharper (higher Hill coefficient), either by cooperative
binding between molecules of the same species when they bind, or by competition
between the two species if there is sufficient steric hindrance.
"
What are the consequences of the coherent coupling between the electron spins and the torsional modes in the nanomechanical resonator?,"  We propose and study a spin-orbit interaction based mechanism to actively
cool down the torsional vibration of a nanomechanical resonator made by
semiconductor materials. We show that the spin-orbit interactions of electrons
can induce a coherent coupling between the electron spins and the torsional
modes of nanomechanical vibration. This coherent coupling leads to an active
cooling for the torsional modes via the dynamical thermalization of the
resonator and the spin ensemble.
"
How do LDLC codes efficiently decode AWGN channels?,"  Low density lattice codes (LDLC) are novel lattice codes that can be decoded
efficiently and approach the capacity of the additive white Gaussian noise
(AWGN) channel. In LDLC a codeword x is generated directly at the n-dimensional
Euclidean space as a linear transformation of a corresponding integer message
vector b, i.e., x = Gb, where H, the inverse of G, is restricted to be sparse.
The fact that H is sparse is utilized to develop a linear-time iterative
decoding scheme which attains, as demonstrated by simulations, good error
performance within ~0.5dB from capacity at block length of n = 100,000 symbols.
The paper also discusses convergence results and implementation considerations.
"
What are the equations of motion that are obtained by applying the holonomic constraint?,"  A holonomic constraint is used to enforce a constant instantaneous
configurational temperature on an equilibrium system. Three sets of equations
of motion are obtained, differing according to the way in which the holonomic
constraint is introduced and the phase space distribution function that is
preserved by the dynamics. Firstly, Gauss' principle of least constraint is
used, and it is shown that it does not preserve the canonical distribution.
Secondly, a modified Hamiltonian is used to find a dynamics that provides a
restricted microcanonical distribution. Lastly, we provide equations that are
specifically designed to both satisfy the temperature constraint and produce a
restricted canonical ensemble.
"
What is the relationship between the decay of superfluid turbulence in superfluid 3He-B and the decay of turbulence in superfluid 4He at high temperatures?,"  We describe measurements of the decay of pure superfluid turbulence in
superfluid 3He-B, in the low temperature regime where the normal fluid density
is negligible. We follow the decay of the turbulence generated by a vibrating
grid as detected by vibrating wire resonators. Despite the absence of any
classical normal fluid dissipation processes, the decay is consistent with
turbulence having the classical Kolmogorov energy spectrum and is remarkably
similar to that measured in superfluid 4He at relatively high temperatures.
Further, our results strongly suggest that the decay is governed by the
superfluid circulation quantum rather than kinematic viscosity.
"
What are the predictions of the learning model proposed in the minority game literature different from other learning models?,"  This paper gives a critical account of the minority game literature. The
minority game is a simple congestion game: players need to choose between two
options, and those who have selected the option chosen by the minority win. The
learning model proposed in this literature seems to differ markedly from the
learning models commonly used in economics. We relate the learning model from
the minority game literature to standard game-theoretic learning models, and
show that in fact it shares many features with these models. However, the
predictions of the learning model differ considerably from the predictions of
most other learning models. We discuss the main predictions of the learning
model proposed in the minority game literature, and compare these to
experimental findings on congestion games.
"
What is the classical Riemann-Hurwitz formula in graph theory?,"  We study harmonic morphisms of graphs as a natural discrete analogue of
holomorphic maps between Riemann surfaces. We formulate a graph-theoretic
analogue of the classical Riemann-Hurwitz formula, study the functorial maps on
Jacobians and harmonic 1-forms induced by a harmonic morphism, and present a
discrete analogue of the canonical map from a Riemann surface to projective
space. We also discuss several equivalent formulations of the notion of a
hyperelliptic graph, all motivated by the classical theory of Riemann surfaces.
As an application of our results, we show that for a 2-edge-connected graph G
which is not a cycle, there is at most one involution $\iota$ on G for which
the quotient $G/\iota$ is a tree. We also show that the number of spanning
trees in a graph G is even if and only if G admits a non-constant harmonic
morphism to the graph B_2 consisting of 2 vertices connected by 2 edges.
Finally, we use the Riemann-Hurwitz formula and our results on hyperelliptic
graphs to classify all hyperelliptic graphs having no Weierstrass points.
"
What is the tunneling magnetoresistance used to measure in magnetic tunnel junctions?,"  We report direct experimental evidence of room temperature spin filtering in
magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) containing CoFe2O4 tunnel barriers via
tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) measurements.
Pt(111)/CoFe2O4(111)/gamma-Al2O3(111)/Co(0001) fully epitaxial MTJs were grown
in order to obtain a high quality system, capable of functioning at room
temperature. Spin polarized transport measurements reveal significant TMR
values of -18% at 2 K and -3% at 290 K. In addition, the TMR ratio follows a
unique bias voltage dependence that has been theoretically predicted to be the
signature of spin filtering in MTJs containing magnetic barriers. CoFe2O4
tunnel barriers therefore provide a model system to investigate spin filtering
in a wide range of temperatures.
"
What is the proof for the equivalence of zero-bin subtractions to convolution with soft Wilson lines?,"  Calculations of collinear correlation functions in perturbative QCD and
Soft-Collinear Effective Theory (SCET) require a prescription for subtracting
soft or zero-bin contributions in order to avoid double counting the
contributions from soft modes. At leading order in $\lambda$, where $\lambda$
is the SCET expansion parameter, the zero-bin subtractions have been argued to
be equivalent to convolution with soft Wilson lines. We give a proof of the
factorization of naive collinear Wilson lines that is crucial for the
derivation of the equivalence. We then check the equivalence by computing the
non-Abelian two-loop mixed collinear-soft contribution to the jet function in
the quark form factor. These results provide strong support for the
equivalence, which can be used to give a nonperturbative definition of the
zero-bin subtraction at lowest order in $\lambda$.
"
What is the analog of the Schauder inequality for closed surfaces in Euclidean spaces?,"  The analog of the Schauder inequality for closed surfaces in Euclidean spaces
is obtained in this article.
"
What are the predictions for particle production at LHC energies?,"  Predictions for particle production at LHC are discussed in the context of
the statistical model. Moreover, the capability of particle ratios to determine
the freeze-out point experimentally is studied, and the best suited ratios are
specified. Finally, canonical suppression in p-p collisions at LHC energies is
discussed in a cluster framework. Measurements with p-p collisions will allow
us to estimate the strangeness correlation volume and to study its evolution
over a large range of incident energies.
"
What are the optimal constant upper bounds for the maximal probabilities of nth convolution powers of discrete uniform distributions?,"  We prove optimal constant over root $n$ upper bounds for the maximal
probabilities of $n$th convolution powers of discrete uniform distributions.
"
What is the topological tensor current in the model?,"  In this paper, based on the gauge potential decomposition and the
$\phi-$mapping theories, we study the topological structures and properties of
the cosmic strings that arise in the Abelian-Higgs gauge theory in the
zero-thickness limit. After a detailed discussion, we conclude that the
topological tensor current introduced in our model is a better and more basic
starting point than the generally used Nambu-Goto effective action for studying
cosmic strings.
"
What is the meaning of the power of an ample line bundle in a projective variety?,"  We confirm Beauville's conjecture that claims that if the p-th exterior power
of the tangent bundle of a smooth projective variety contains the p-th power of
an ample line bundle, then the variety is either the projective space or the
p-dimensional quadric hypersurface.
"
What is the pattern speed of the bar in the barred spiral galaxy NGC 6946?,"  We study the kinematics of the barred spiral galaxy NGC 6946 by investigating
the velocity field from H-alpha Fabry-Perot observations, determined the
pattern speed of the bar by using the Tremaine-Weinberg method, and find a main
pattern speed of 21.7 (+4.0,-0.8) km/s/kpc. Our data clearly suggest the
presence of an additional pattern with a pattern speed more than twice that of
the large pattern in this galaxy. We use the epicycle approximation to deduce
the location of the resonance radii and subsequently determine the pattern
speed between the radii, and find that inside the inner Inner Lindblad
Resonance radius, a bar-like system has evolved.
"
What is the buildup and decay of dynamical nuclear spin polarization in a single semiconductor quantum dot?,"  We present an experimental study of the dynamics underlying the buildup and
decay of dynamical nuclear spin polarization in a single semiconductor quantum
dot. Our experiment shows that the nuclei can be polarized on a time scale of a
few milliseconds, while their decay dynamics depends drastically on external
parameters. We show that a single electron can very efficiently depolarize the
nuclear spins and discuss two processes that can cause this depolarization.
Conversely, in the absence of a quantum dot electron, the lifetime of nuclear
spin polarization is on the time scale of a second, most likely limited by the
non-secular terms of the nuclear dipole-dipole interaction. We can further
suppress this depolarization rate by 1-2 orders of magnitude by applying an
external magnetic field exceeding 1 mT.
"
What is the Parametric Perturbation Theory (PPT) used to resum the divergent perturbative series?,"  We present a {\sl non--perturbative} method, called {\sl Parametric
Perturbation Theory} (PPT), which is alternative to the ordinary perturbation
theory. The method relies on a principle of simplicity for the observable
solutions, which are constrained to be linear in a certain (unphysical)
parameter. The perturbative expansion is carried out in this parameter and not
in the physical coupling (as in ordinary perturbation theory). We show that the
method is capable to resum the divergent perturbative series, to {\sl extract}
the leading asymptotic (strong coupling) behavior and {\sl predict} with high
accuracy the coefficients of the perturbative series.
"
What are the underlying physical principles of the greenhouse effect that are wrong?,"  The atmospheric greenhouse effect, an idea that many authors trace back to
the traditional works of Fourier (1824), Tyndall (1861), and Arrhenius (1896),
and which is still supported in global climatology, essentially describes a
fictitious mechanism, in which a planetary atmosphere acts as a heat pump
driven by an environment that is radiatively interacting with but radiatively
equilibrated to the atmospheric system. According to the second law of
thermodynamics such a planetary machine can never exist. Nevertheless, in
almost all texts of global climatology and in a widespread secondary literature
it is taken for granted that such mechanism is real and stands on a firm
scientific foundation. In this paper the popular conjecture is analyzed and the
underlying physical principles are clarified. By showing that (a) there are no
common physical laws between the warming phenomenon in glass houses and the
fictitious atmospheric greenhouse effects, (b) there are no calculations to
determine an average surface temperature of a planet, (c) the frequently
mentioned difference of 33 degrees Celsius is a meaningless number calculated
wrongly, (d) the formulas of cavity radiation are used inappropriately, (e) the
assumption of a radiative balance is unphysical, (f) thermal conductivity and
friction must not be set to zero, the atmospheric greenhouse conjecture is
falsified.
"
How can precompression be used to characterize the interior of a giant planet?,"  This work uses density functional molecular dynamics simulations of fluid
helium at high pressure to examine how shock wave experiments with
precompressed samples can help characterizing the interior of giant planets. In
particular, we analyze how large of a precompression is needed to probe a
certain depth in a planet's gas envelope. We find that precompressions of up to
0.1, 1.0, 10, or 100 GPa are needed to characterized 2.5, 5.9, 18, to 63% of
Jupiter's envelope by mass.
"
What is the dust extinction of spiral galaxies measured with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey DR4 spectroscopic sample?,"  A spiral galaxy partially ovelapping a more distant elliptical offers an
unique opportunity to measure the dust extinction in the foreground spiral.
  From the Sloan Digital Sky Survey DR4 spectroscopic sample, we selected 83
occulting galaxy pairs and measured disk opacity over the redshift range z =
0.0-0.2 with the goal to determine the recent evolution of disk dust opacity.
The enrichment of the ISM changes over the lifetime of a disk and it is
reasonable to expect the dust extinction properties of spiral disks as a whole
to change over their lifetime. When they do, the change will affect our
measurements of galaxies over the observable universe.
  From the SDSS pairs we conclude that spiral disks show evidence of extinction
to ~2 effective radii. However, no evidence for recent evolution of disk
opacity is evident, due to the limited redshift range and our inability to
distinguish other factors on disk opacity such as the presence of spiral arms
and Hubble type. Such effects also mask any relation between surface brightness
and optical depth that has been found in nearby galaxies. Hence, we conclude
that the SDSS spectral catalog is an excellent way to find occulting pairs and
construct a uniform local sample. However, higher resolution than the SDSS
images is needed to disentangle the effects of spiral arms and Hubble type from
evolution since z = 0.2.
"
What are the Pauli paramagnetic and Curie-Weiss metals in the vicinity of x*?,"  Electronic properties of the sodium cobaltate NaxCoO2 are systematically
studied through a precise control of band filling. Resistivity, magnetic
susceptibility and specific heat measurements are carried out on a series of
high-quality polycrystalline samples prepared at 200 C with Na content in a
wide range of 0.35 =< x =< 0.70. It is found that dramatic changes in
electronic properties take place at a critical Na concentration x* that lies
between 0.58 and 0.59, which separates a Pauli paramagnetic and a Curie-Weiss
metals. It is suggested that at x* the Fermi level touches the bottom of the
a1g band at the gamma point, leading to a crucial change in the density of
states across x* and the emergence of a small electron pocket around the gamma
point for x > x*.
"
What are the geometrical loci of all the orbits in the space of physical parameters in Kerr space-time?,"  Gravitational radiation of binary systems can be studied by using the
adiabatic approximation in General Relativity. In this approach a small
astrophysical object follows a trajectory consisting of a chained series of
bounded geodesics (orbits) in the outer region of a Kerr Black Hole,
representing the space time created by a bigger object. In our paper we study
the entire class of orbits, both of constant radius (spherical orbits), as well
as non-null eccentricity orbits, showing a number of properties on the physical
parameters and trajectories. The main result is the determination of the
geometrical locus of all the orbits in the space of physical parameters in Kerr
space-time. This becomes a powerful tool to know if different orbits can be
connected by a continuous change of their physical parameters. A discussion on
the influence of different values of the angular momentum of the hole is given.
Main results have been obtained by analytical methods.
"
What is the multi-phase representation of the ISM in NB-TSPH simulations?,"  We present a multi-phase representation of the ISM in NB-TSPH simulations of
galaxy formation and evolution with particular attention to the case of
early-type galaxies. Cold gas clouds are described by the so-called sticky
particles algorithm. They can freely move throughout the hot ISM medium; stars
form within these clouds and the mass exchange among the three baryonic phases
(hot gas, cold clouds, stars) is governed by radiative and Compton cooling and
energy feedback by supernova (SN) explosions, stellar winds, and UV radiation.
We also consider thermal conduction, cloud-cloud collisions, and chemical
enrichment. Our model agrees with and improves upon previous studies on the
same subject. The results for the star formation rate are very promising and
agree with recent observational data on early-type galaxies. These models lend
further support to the revised monolithic scheme of galaxy formation, which has
recently been also strengthened by high redshift data leading to the so-called
downsizing and top-down scenarios.
"
What is the ratio of the chiral perturbation to the spin magnetization in Chiral Perturbation Theory?,"  We study the ratios R_{e/mu}^{(P)} = Gamma(P -> e nu [gamma])/Gamma(P -> mu
nu [gamma]) (P=pi,K) in Chiral Perturbation Theory to order e^2 p^4. We
complement the two-loop effective theory results with a matching calculation of
the counterterm, finding R_{e/mu}^{(pi)} = (1.2352 \pm 0.0001)*10^(-4) and
R_{e/mu}^{(K)} = (2.477 \pm 0.001)*10^(-5).
"
What are the isomorphism classes of connected finite covering spaces?,"  Physicists showed that the generating function of orbifold elliptic genera of
symmetric orbifolds can be written as an infinite product. We show that there
exists a geometric factorization on space level behind this infinite product
formula in much more general framework, where factors in the infinite product
correspond to isomorphism classes of connected finite covering spaces of
manifolds involved. From this formula, a concept of geometric Hecke operators
for functors emerges. We show that these Hecke operators indeed satisfy the
usual identity of Hecke operators for the case of 2-dimensional tori.
"
What are the Yang-Baxter equations for the new unitary braid representations?,"  In this paper we describe connections among extraspecial 2-groups, unitary
representations of the braid group and multi-qubit braiding quantum gates. We
first construct new representations of extraspecial 2-groups. Extending the
latter by the symmetric group, we construct new unitary braid representations,
which are solutions to generalized Yang-Baxter equations and use them to
realize new braiding quantum gates. These gates generate the GHZ
(Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger) states, for an arbitrary (particularly an
\emph{odd}) number of qubits, from the product basis. We also discuss the
Yang-Baxterization of the new braid group representations, which describes
unitary evolution of the GHZ states. Our study suggests that through their
connection with braiding gates, extraspecial 2-groups and the GHZ states may
play an important role in quantum error correction and topological quantum
computing.
"
What is the upper limit of the diffuse flux of muon neutrinos from unresolved sources?,"  A search for TeV - PeV muon neutrinos from unresolved sources was performed
on AMANDA-II data collected between 2000 and 2003 with an equivalent livetime
of 807 days. This diffuse analysis sought to find an extraterrestrial neutrino
flux from sources with non-thermal components. The signal is expected to have a
harder spectrum than the atmospheric muon and neutrino backgrounds. Since no
excess of events was seen in the data over the expected background, an upper
limit of E^{2}\Phi_{90% C.L.} < 7.4 x 10^{-8} GeV cm^{-2} s^{-1} sr^{-1} is
placed on the diffuse flux of muon neutrinos with a \Phi \propto E^{-2}
spectrum in the energy range 16 TeV to 2.5 PeV. This is currently the most
sensitive \Phi \propto E^{-2} diffuse astrophysical neutrino limit. We also set
upper limits for astrophysical and prompt neutrino models, all of which have
spectra different than \Phi \propto E^{-2}.
"
What is the reason for the withdrawal of this paper?,"  This paper has been withdrawn by the authors due to some fatal errors in the
analysis.
"
How can we judge whether a software component is over- or under-generalized?,"  Software is a communication system. The usual topic of communication is
program behavior, as encoded by programs. Domain-specific libraries are
codebooks, domain-specific languages are coding schemes, and so forth. To turn
metaphor into method, we adapt toolsfrom information theory--the study of
efficient communication--to probe the efficiency with which languages and
libraries let us communicate programs. In previous work we developed an
information-theoretic analysis of software reuse in problem domains. This new
paper uses information theory to analyze tradeoffs in the design of components,
generators, and metalanguages. We seek answers to two questions: (1) How can we
judge whether a component is over- or under-generalized? Drawing on minimum
description length principles, we propose that the best component yields the
most succinct representation of the use cases. (2) If we view a programming
language as an assemblage of metalanguages, each providing a complementary
style of abstraction, how can these metalanguages aid or hinder us in
efficiently describing software? We describe a complex triangle of interactions
between the power of an abstraction mechanism, the amount of reuse it enables,
and the cognitive difficulty of its use.
"
What is the evidence for the presence of an active galactic nucleus in the galaxy NGC4438?,"  We present multi-frequency, radio-continuum and HI observations of NGC4438,
the highly-disturbed, active galaxy in the Virgo cluster, with the VLA and the
GMRT. High-resolution observations with the VLA at 4860 and 8460 MHz show the
presence of an inverted-spectrum radio nucleus located between the highly
asymmetric lobes of radio emission. This demonstrates that these lobes arise
due to an AGN rather than a compact nuclear starburst. The low-frequency radio
continuum observations made with the GMRT detect the extended emission on the
western side of the galaxy whose spectral index is flatter at higher
frequencies and suggests that it is a mixture of thermal and non-thermal
emission.
  The HI observations show an elongated structure which is displaced by ~4.1
kpc on the western side of NGC4438 and has a size of ~9.8 kpc and a mass of
1.8*10^8 M_sun. The velocity field suggests systematic rotation. We also detect
HI emission from the disk of the galaxy with a mass of 1.2*10^8 M_sun. We
detect a faint HI tail towards the north of NGC4438 close to a stellar tail
seen in deep optical observations. This HI tail has a total extent of ~50 kpc
and a mass of 1.4*10^8 M_sun if it is at the distance of NGC4438. The velocity
of the HI tail is ~-10 km/s similar to that of HI emission from IC 3355, but
the possibility that the tail could be foreground Galactic emission cannot be
ruled out. We discuss the different structures in the light of different
models.

What are Newton's identities in the context of the Demonstration of the Demonstration of the Demonstratio gemina theorematis Neutoniani?,"  Translation from the Latin original, ""Demonstratio gemina theorematis
Neutoniani, quo traditur relatio inter coefficientes cuiusvis aequationis
algebraicae et summas potestatum radicum eiusdem"" (1747). E153 in the Enestrom
index. In this paper Euler gives two proofs of Newton's identities, which
express the sums of powers of the roots of a polynomial in terms of its
coefficients. The first proof takes the derivative of a logarithm. The second
proof uses induction and the fact that in a polynomial of degree $n$, the
coefficient of $x^{n-k}$ is equal to the sum of the products of $k$ roots,
times $(-1)^k$.
"
What is the behavior of the saturated flux for different velocity profiles of the fluid?,"  We present a study of sediment transport in the creeping and saltation
regime. In our model, a bed of particles is simulated with the conventional
event-driven method. The particles are considered as hard disks in a 2d domain,
with periodic boundary conditions in horizontal direction. The flow of the
fluid over this bed of particles is modeled by imposing a force on each
particle that depends on the velocity of the fluid and its height above the
bed. We considered two velocity profiles for the fluid, parabolic and
logarithmic. The first one models laminar flow and the second corresponds to
turbulent flow. For each case we investigated the behavior of the saturated
flux. We found that for the logarithmic profile, the saturated flux shows a
quadratic increase with the strength of the flow, and for parabolic profile, a
cubic increase. The velocity distribution functions are used to interpret the
results.
"
What is the best fit function for the observational z-distributions of cataclysmic variables (CVs)?,"  The spatial distribution, galactic model parameters and luminosity function
of cataclysmic variables (CVs) in the solar neighbourhood have been determined
from a carefully established sample of 459 CVs. The sample contains all of the
CVs with distances computed from the Period-Luminosity-Colours (PLCs) relation
of CVs which has been recently derived and calibrated with {\em 2MASS}
photometric data. It has been found that an exponential function fits best to
the observational z-distributions of all of the CVs in the sample, non-magnetic
CVs and dwarf novae, while the sech^{2} function is more appropriate for
nova-like stars and polars. The vertical scaleheight of CVs is 158$\pm$14 pc
for the {\em 2MASS} J-band limiting apparent magnitude of 15.8. On the other
hand, the vertical scaleheights are 128$\pm$20 and 160$\pm$5 pc for dwarf novae
and nova-like stars, respectively. The local space density of CVs is found to
be $\sim3\times10^{-5}$ pc^{-3} which is in agreement with the lower limit of
the theoretical predictions. The luminosity function of CVs shows an increasing
trend toward higher space densities at low luminosities, implying that the
number of short-period systems should be high. The discrepancies between the
theoretical and observational population studies of CVs will almost disappear
if for the z-dependence of the space density the sech^{2} density function is
used.
"
What are the conditions for the existence of at least two distinct prime closed geodesics on a rationally homological n-dimensional sphere?,"  In this paper we prove that for every bumpy Finsler metric $F$ on every
rationally homological $n$-dimensional sphere $S^n$ with $n\ge 2$, there exist
always at least two distinct prime closed geodesics.
"
What are the implications of the corrections for the theoretical background predictions?,"  Corrections of 10-30% for backgrounds to the H --> WW --> l^+l^-\sla{p}_T
search in vector boson and gluon fusion at the LHC are reviewed to make the
case for precise and accurate theoretical background predictions.
"
What are the results of the CDF and D0 collaborations on the top-quark pair-production cross section and limits?,"  The latest results from the CDF and D0 collaborations on the top-quark
pair-production cross section and limits on electroweak production are
presented. Included are measurements of properties of the top quark such as
charge, lifetime, and the decay branching ratio t->Wb. In addition to
measurements about the top quark, the selected event samples are used to study
the helicity of the W boson and to search for additional exotic quarks (t') and
resonances in the ttbar invariant mass spectrum.
"
What is the significance of the discovery of two low-luminosity quasars at z~4?,"  We report the discovery of two low-luminosity quasars at z~4, both of which
show prominent N IV] 1486A emission. This line is extremely rare in quasar
spectra at any redshift; detecting it in two out of a sample of 23 objects
(i.e., ~ 9% of the sample) is intriguing and is likely due to the
low-luminosity, high-redshift quasar sample we are studying. This is still a
poorly explored regime, where contributions from associated, early starbursts
may be significant. One interpretation of this line posits photoionization by
very massive young stars. Seeing N IV] 1486A emission in a high-redshift quasar
may thus be understood in the context of co-formation and early co-evolution of
galaxies and their supermassive black holes. Alternatively, we may be seeing a
phenomenon related to the early evolution of quasar broad emission line
regions. The non-detection (and possibly even broad absorption) of N V 1240A
line in the spectrum of one of these quasars may support that interpretation.
These two objects may signal a new faint quasar population or an early AGN
evolutionary stage at high redshifts.
"
What is the charged Higgs boson predicted by the LRTH model?,"  The left-right twin Higgs(LRTH) model predicts the existence of the charged
Higgs $\phi^{\pm}$. In this paper, we study the production of the charged Higgs
boson $\phi^{-}$ with single top quark via the process $bg\to t\phi^{-}$ at the
$CERN$ Large Hadron Collider(LHC). The numerical results show that the
production cross section can reach the level of $10 pb$ in the reasonable
parameter space of the LRTH model. We expect that, as long as it is not too
heavy, the possible signatures of the heavy charged Higgs boson $\phi^{-}$
might be detected via the decay mode $\phi^{-}\to \bar{t}b$ at the LHC
experiments.
"
What is the physical version and equilibrium state version of the first law of thermodynamics for a black object consisting of n-dimensional charged stationary axisymmetric black hole?,"  The physical version and equilibrium state version of the first law of
thermodynamics for a black object consisting of n-dimensional charged
stationary axisymmetric black hole surrounded by $a$ black rings, the so-called
black Saturn was derived. The general setting for our derivation is
n-dimensional dilaton gravity with p + 1 strength form fields.
"
"What are the quadrupole moments of Hg($6s6p$) $^3P_0$,$^3P_1$,$^3P_2$, and $^1P_1$ atoms calculated using the ab initio relativistic configuration-interaction method?","  The long-range quadrupole-quadrupole ($\sim R^{-5}$) and leading dispersion
($\sim R^{-6}$) interactions between all pairs of excited Hg($6s6p$) $^3P_0$,
$^3P_1$, $^3P_2$, and $^1P_1$ atoms are determined. The quadrupole moments are
calculated using the {\it ab initio} relativistic configuration-interaction
method coupled with many-body perturbation theory. The van der Waals
coefficients are approximated using previously calculated static
polarizabilities and expressions for the dispersion energy that are validated
with similar systems. The long-range interactions are critical for associative
ionization in thermal and cold collisions, and are found to be quite different
for different pairs of interacting states. Based on this knowledge and the
short-range parts of previously calculated potential curves, improved estimates
of the chemi-ionization cross sections are obtained.
"
What are the implications of the Polonyi field for supersymmetry breaking?,"  We reinvestigate the cosmological Polonyi problem in the case where the
Polonyi mass is $\mathcal{O}(10) \rm{TeV}$. Such a large supersymmetry breaking
scale implies that the Polonyi field should be sequestered from the standard
model sector. Since the Polonyi field does not have a coupling to the gauge
multiplets at tree level, in order to obtain sufficiently high reheating
temperature compatible with the standard big-bang nucleosynthesis the Polonyi
mass well exceeds 100 - 1000 TeV, depending on the decay channels. Moreover, we
find that the branching ratio of the Polonyi field into neutralinos is of order
unity, and thus the resulting neutralino LSPs, if stable, overclose the
Universe even for the case of the wino-like LSP. Our explicit computation given
here exhibits a very serious cosmological difficulty for models where
supersymmetry breaking is caused by the Polonyi-type field.
"
How can the presence of birefringent layers with misaligned in-plane anisotropy enhance the performance of the photonic-crystal Fabry-Perot resonator?,"  We consider transmission band edge resonance in periodic layered structures
involving birefringent layers. Previously we have shown that the presence of
birefringent layers with misaligned in-plane anisotropy can dramatically
enhance the performance of the photonic-crystal Fabry-Perot resonator. It
allows to reduce its size by an order of magnitude without compromising on its
performance. The key characteristic of the enhanced photonic-crystal cavity is
that its Bloch dispersion relation displays a degenerate photonic band edge,
rather than only regular ones. This can be realized in specially arranged
stacks of misaligned anisotropic layers. On the down side, the presence of
birefringent layers results in the Fabry-Perot resonance being coupled only
with one (elliptic) polarization component of the incident wave, while the
other polarization component is reflected back to space. In this paper we show
how a small modification of the periodic layered array can solve the above
fundamental problem and provide a perfect impedance match regardless of the
incident wave polarization, while preserving the giant transmission resonance,
characteristic of a degenerate photonic band edge. Both features are of
critical importance for a variety of practical applications, including
antennas, light amplification, optical and microwave filters, etc.
"
What is the propagator in the microcanonical ensemble explicitly computed?,"  Starting with the well-known Nambu-Goto action for an N-extended body system
the propagator in the microcanonical ensemble is explicitly computed. This
propagator is independent of the temperature and, in contrast with the previous
references, takes account on all the non-local effects produced by the extended
objects (e.g., strings) in interaction. The relation between relativistic
quantum field theories in the microcanonical approach and the pure S-matrix
formulation is stablished and analyzed.

"
What is the relationship between the Doppler shift of frequency and the space anisotropy magnitude?,"  The impact of local space anisotropy on the transverse Doppler effect is
examined. Two types of laboratory experiments aimed at seeking and measuring
the local space anisotropy are proposed. In terms of the conventional special
relativity theory, which treats 3D space to be locally isotropic, the
experiments are of the type of ``null-experiments''. In the first-type
experiments, a feasible Doppler shift of frequency is measured by the
M\""ossbauer effect, with the M\""ossbauer source and absorber being located at
two identical and diametrically opposed distances from the center of a rapidly
rotating rotor, while the $\gamma$-quanta are recorded by two stationary and
oppositely positioned proportional counters. Either of the counters records
only those $\gamma$-quanta that passed through the absorber at the moment of
the passage of the latter near a counter. The second-type experiments are made
using the latest radio physics techniques for generating monochromatic
oscillations and for recording weak signals. The effect expected due to space
anisotropy consists in frequency modulation of the harmonic oscillations coming
to a receiver that rotates at a constant velocity around the monochromatic wave
emitter. In this case the modulation depth proves to be proportional to the
space anisotropy magnitude.
"
What is the amplitude of the hadronic duality picture in the Veneziano model?,"  A phenomenologically successful two-component hadronic duality picture led to
Veneziano's amplitude, the fundamental first step to string theory. This
picture is briefly recalled and its two components are identified as the open
strings (mesons and baryons) and closed strings (Pomeron).
"
What are the implications of the triangle of Heisenberg spins and anisotropies?,"  We calculate the response of a molecular magnet subject to a time-varying
magnetic field and coupled to a heat bath. We propose that observations of
calculated oscillations transverse to the field direction may be an effective
way of demonstrating quantum tunneling and thus probing the details of level
repulsion. The effective model of a triangle of Heisenberg spins and weak
anisotropies, as has been used to model the molecular magnets V15 and Cu3, is
used to illustrate this.
"
What is the implication of the lack of association between SNII and current star formation?,"  We have attempted to constrain the progenitors of all supernova types,
through correlations of the positions of historical supernovae with recent star
formation, as traced by H-alpha emission. Through pixel statistics we have
found that a large fraction of the SNII population do not show any association
with current star formation, which we put down to a 'runaway' fraction of these
progenitors. The SNIb/c population accurately traces the H-alpha emission, with
some suggestion that the SNIc progenitors show a higher degree of correlation
than the SNIb, suggesting higher mass progenitors for the former. Overall the
SNIa population only show a weak correlation to the positions of HII regions,
but as many as a half may be associated with a young stellar population.
"
What are the implications of the annual modulation signature for the investigation of dark matter particles?,"  DAMA is an observatory for rare processes and it is operative deep
underground at the Gran Sasso National Laboratory of the I.N.F.N. (LNGS). Here
some arguments will be presented on the investigation on dark matter particles
by annual modulation signature and on some of the realized double beta decay
searches.
"
How much can the branching ratio of the Higgs boson be enhanced by an order of magnitude compared to the Standard Model for Higgs masses around 130 GeV?,"  We show that there are regions in the parameter space of the Littlest Higgs
model with T-parity, allowed by electroweak precision data, where the Higgs
boson can decay invisibly into a pair of heavy photons A_H with a substantial
branching ratio. For a symmetry breaking scale f in the range 450-600 GeV, the
BR(H -> A_H A_H) can be up to 95% for an intermediate mass Higgs, and from 20%
down to a few percents for a Higgs boson of mass 200 GeV or above. The total
decay width of the Higgs boson can thereby be enhanced by an order of magnitude
compared to the Standard Model for Higgs masses around 130 GeV.
"
How can the tachyonic instability in Ekpyrotic Cosmology be naturally stabilized?,"  New Ekpyrotic Cosmology is an alternative scenario of early universe
cosmology in which the universe existed before the big bang. The simplest model
relies on two scalar fields, whose entropy perturbation leads to a
scale-invariant spectrum of density fluctuations. The ekpyrotic solution has a
tachyonic instability along the entropy field direction which, a priori,
appears to require fine-tuning of the initial conditions. In this paper, we
show that these can be achieved naturally by adding a small positive mass term
for the tachyonic field and coupling to light fermions. Then, for a wide range
of initial conditions, the tachyonic field gets stabilized with the appropriate
values well before the onset of the ekpyrotic phase. Furthermore, we show that
ekpyrotic theory is successful in solving the flatness, horizon and homogeneity
problems of standard big bang cosmology. Motivated by the analysis of the
tachyonic instability, we propose a simplification of the model in terms of new
field variables. Instead of requiring two exponential potentials, one for each
scalar field, it suffices to consider a single nearly exponential potential for
one of the fields and a tachyonic mass term along the orthogonal direction in
field space. All other terms in the potential are essentially arbitrary. This
greatly widens the class of ekpyrotic potentials and allows substantial freedom
in determining the spectral index and possible non-Gaussianity. We present a
generalized expression for the spectral index which is easily consistent with
the observed red tilt. We also argue that for a wide range of potentials
non-Gaussianity can be substantial, within the reach of current observations.
"
What is the evidence for the absence of inversion symmetry in superconductors?,"  We report measurements of the temperature dependence of the magnetic
penetration depth \lambda(T) in non-centrosymmetric superconductor Re_3W. We
employed two experimental techniques: extraction of \lambda(T) from magnetic
{\em dc}-susceptibility, measured on a powder sample, and the rf tunnel diode
resonator technique, where a bulk polycrystalline sample was used. The results
of both techniques agree: the temperature dependence of the penetration depth
can be well described by weak-coupling, dirty-limit, s-wave BCS theory where we
obtain $\Delta(0)/k_BT_C=1.76$. No evidence for unconventional pairing
resulting from the absence of the inversion symmetry is found.
"
What are the constraints on the Alexander polynomials for a co-dimension two knot in a knot?,"  We show that if a co-dimension two knot is deform-spun from a
lower-dimensional co-dimension 2 knot, there are constraints on the Alexander
polynomials. In particular this shows, for all n, that not all co-dimension 2
knots in S^n are deform-spun from knots in S^{n-1}.
"
What is the impact of self-irradiation on the properties of superconductors?,"  The 18.5 K superconductor PuCoGa5 has many unusual properties, including
those due to damage induced by self-irradiation. The superconducting transition
temperature decreases sharply with time, suggesting a radiation-induced Frenkel
defect concentration much larger than predicted by current radiation damage
theories. Extended x-ray absorption fine-structure measurements demonstrate
that while the local crystal structure in fresh material is well ordered, aged
material is disordered much more strongly than expected from simple defects,
consistent with strong disorder throughout the damage cascade region. These
data highlight the potential impact of local lattice distortions relative to
defects on the properties of irradiated materials and underscore the need for
more atomic-resolution structural comparisons between radiation damage
experiments and theory.
"
What are the three quark mixing angles determined by the SU(2) horizontal symmetries?,"  We show that all mixing angles are determined, within experimental
uncertainty, by a product of SU(2) horizontal symmetries intimately linked to
the algebra of weak neutral currents. This concerns: on one hand, the three
quark mixing angles; on the other hand, a neutrino-like pattern in which
theta_{23} is maximal and tan (2 theta_{12}) = 2. The latter turns out to
exactly satisfy the ``quark-lepton complementarity condition'' theta_c +
theta_{12} = pi/4. Moreover, among all solutions, two values for the third
neutrino mixing angle arise, which satisfy the bound sin^2(theta_{13}) \leq
0.1: theta_{13} = +/- 5.7 10^{-3} and theta_{13} = +/- 0.2717.
"
What are the geometrical foundations of the general relativity in terms of the bundle of oriented complex orthogonal 3-frames?,"  An alternative to the representation of complex relativity by self-dual
complex 2-forms on the spacetime manifold is presented by assuming that that
the bundle of real 2-forms is given an almost-complex structure. From this, one
can define a complex orthogonal structure on the bundle of 2-forms, which
results in a more direct representation of the complex orthogonal group in
three complex dimensions. The geometrical foundations of general relativity are
then presented in terms of the bundle of oriented complex orthogonal 3-frames
on the bundle of 2-forms in a manner that essentially parallels their
construction in terms of self-dual complex 2-forms. It is shown that one can
still discuss the Debever-Penrose classification of the Riemannian curvature
tensor in terms of the representation presented here.
"
What are the $p$-adic analytic properties of the height zeta function?,"  In this brief note, we will investigate the number of points of bounded
(twisted) height in a projective variety defined over a function field, where
the function field comes from a projective variety of dimension greater than or
equal to 2. A first step in this investigation is to understand the $p$-adic
analytic properties of the height zeta function. In particular, we will show
that for a large class of projective varieties this function is $p$-adic
meromorphic.
"
What are the conservation laws in sigma models based on a compact Lie group?,"  We discuss the current conservation laws in sigma models based on a compact
Lie groups of the same dimensionality and connected to each other via
pseudoduality transformations in two dimensions. We show that pseudoduality
transformations induce an infinite number of nonlocal conserved currents on the
pseudodual manifold.
"
What are the implications of the KK constraint on the zero mode for the production of KK states in a given temperature?,"  The cosmology of KK gravitinos in models with extra dimensions is considered.
The main result is that the production of such KK modes is not compatible with
an epoch of non--standard expansion after inflation. This is so because the BBN
constraint on the zero mode forces the reduced five dimensional Planck mass
$M_5$ down to values much smaller than the usual four dimensional one, but this
in turn implies many KK states available for a given temperature. Once these
states are taken into account one finds that there is no $M_5$ for which the
produced KK gravitinos satisfy BBN and overclosure constraints. This conclusion
holds for both flat and warped models in which only gravity propagates in the
full spacetime.
"
How can the current observational data distinguish between an IGM which is significantly neutral or highly ionized just above z=6?,"  We examine a large set of synthetic quasar spectra to realistically assess
the potential of using the relative sizes of highly ionized near-zones in the
Lya and Lyb forest as a probe of the neutral hydrogen content of the
intergalactic medium (IGM) at z>6. The scatter in the relative near-zone size
distribution, induced by underlying fluctuations in the baryonic density field
and the filtering of ionizing radiation, is considerable even for fixed
assumptions about the IGM neutral fraction. As a consequence, the current
observational data cannot distinguish between an IGM which is significantly
neutral or highly ionized just above z=6. Under standard assumptions for quasar
ages and ionizing luminosities, a future sample of several tens of high
resolution Lya and Lyb near-zone spectra should be capable of distinguishing
between a volume weighted neutral hydrogen fraction in the IGM which is greater
or less than 10 per cent.
"
What is the role of the Hubble constant in a 3D space?,"  It is shown that, in the model of a flat 3D space, the time (i.e., the Hubble
or the gravitation constant) plays a role of a spatial property. Gravitation
field of spherical central mass does not lead to a lowering of symmetry of the
space and appearance of anisotropy. In particular, the relations that describe
the changes in the refractive indices of the space treated as an optical medium
near the massive spherical body under the influence of its gravitation field
have been derived.
"
What is the relationship between the Hermitian model and the PT-symmetric model?,"  We construct PT-symmetric quantum mechanical models with an O(N)-symmetric
interaction term of the form $-g(\vec{x}^{2})^{2}/N$. Using functional integral
methods, we find the equivalent Hermitian model, which has several unusual
features. The effective potential obtained in the large-N limit of the
Hermitian form is shown to be identical to the form obtained from the original
PT-symmetric model using familiar constraint field methods. The analogous
constraint field prescription in four dimensions suggests that
$-g(\vec{\phi}^{2})^{2}/N$ PT-symmetric scalar field theories are
asymptotically free.
"
What are the implications of the Magellanic Stream and Leading Arm having a common origin in the Large Magellanic Cloud?,"  We explore the Magellanic Stream (MS) using a Gaussian decomposition of the
HI velocity profiles in the Leiden-Argentine-Bonn (LAB) all-sky HI survey. This
decomposition exposes the MS to be composed of two filaments distinct both
spatially (as first pointed out by Putman et al.) and in velocity. Using the
velocity coherence of the filaments, one can be traced back to its origin in
what we identify as the SouthEast HI Overdensity (SEHO) of the Large Magellanic
Cloud (LMC), which includes 30 Doradus. Parts of the Leading Arm (LA) can also
be traced back to the SEHO in velocity and position. Therefore, at least
one-half of the trailing Stream and most of the LA originates in the LMC,
contrary to previous assertions that both the MS and the LA originate in the
Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) and/or in the Magellanic Bridge. The two MS
filaments show strong periodic, undulating spatial and velocity patterns that
we speculate are an imprint of the LMC rotation curve. If true, then the drift
rate of the Stream gas away from the Magellanic Clouds is ~49 km/s and the age
of the MS is ~1.74 Gyr. The Staveley-Smith et al. high-resolution HI data of
the LMC show gas outflows from supergiant shells in the SEHO that seem to be
creating the LA and LMC filament of the MS. Blowout of LMC gas is an effect not
previously accounted for but one that probably plays an important role in
creating the MS and LA.
"
What is the relative rate of the Xi_b^{-} decay compared to the Lambda_b to J/psi Lambda decay?,"  We report the first direct observation of the strange b baryon Xi_b^{-}. We
reconstruct the decay Xi_b^{-} to J/psi Xi^{-}, with J/psi to dimuons and
Xi^{-} to Lambda pion, in ppbar collisions at sqrt(s) = 1.96 TeV. Using 1.3
fb^{-1} of data collected by the D0 detector, we observe 15.2 +/- 4.4(stat.)+
1.9/-0.4(syst.) Xi_b^{-} candidates at a mass of 5.774 +/- 0.011(stat.) +/-
0.015 (syst.) GeV. The significance of the observed signal is 5.5 sigmas,
equivalent to a probability of 3.3 X 10^{-8} of it arising from a background
fluctuation. Normalizing to the decay Lambda_b to J/psi Lambda, we measure the
relative rate to be 0.28 +/- 0.09(stat.)+ 0.09/-0.08 (syst.).
"
"What are the likely artifacts that can arise in such experiments, with reference to the recent PVLAS observations and the previous findings of the BFRT collaboration?","  We discuss the experimental techniques used to date for measuring the changes
in polarization state of a laser produced by a strong transverse magnetic field
acting in a vacuum. We point out the likely artifacts that can arise in such
experiments, with particular reference to the recent PVLAS observations and the
previous findings of the BFRT collaboration. Our observations are based on
studies with a photon-noise limited coherent homodyne interferometer with a
polarization sensitivity of 2x10^-8 rad Hz^(1/2) mW^(-1/2).
"
What is the only exception among finite Abelian groups that is not conjugate to a group of automorphisms of a minimal surface?,"  This article gives the proof of results announced in [J. Blanc, Finite
Abelian subgroups of the Cremona group of the plane, C.R. Acad. Sci. Paris,
S\'er. I 344 (2007), 21-26.] and some description of automorphisms of rational
surfaces.
  Given a finite Abelian subgroup of the Cremona group of the plane, we provide
a way to decide whether it is birationally conjugate to a group of
automorphisms of a minimal surface.
  In particular, we prove that a finite cyclic group of birational
transformations of the plane is linearisable if and only if none of its
non-trivial elements fix a curve of positive genus. For finite Abelian groups,
there exists only one surprising exception, a group isomorphic to Z/2ZxZ/4Z,
whose non-trivial elements do not fix a curve of positive genus but which is
not conjugate to a group of automorphisms of a minimal rational surface.
  We also give some descriptions of automorphisms (not necessarily of finite
order) of del Pezzo surfaces and conic bundles.
"
What is the relationship between the Strehl ratio and the phase efficiency in telescope systems?,"  The performance of telescope systems working at microwave or visible/IR
wavelengths is typically described in terms of different parameters according
to the wavelength range. Most commercial ray tracing packages have been
specifically designed for use with visible/IR systems and thus, though very
flexible and sophisticated, do not provide the appropriate parameters to fully
describe microwave antennas, and thus to compare with specifications. In this
work we demonstrate that the Strehl ratio is equal to the phase efficiency when
the apodization factor is taken into account. The phase efficiency is the most
critical contribution to the aperture efficiency of an antenna, and the most
difficult parameter to optimize during the telescope design. The equivalence
between the Strehl ratio and the phase efficiency gives the designer/user of
the telescope the opportunity to use the faster commercial ray-tracing software
to optimize the design. We also discuss the results of several tests performed
to check the validity of this relationship that we carried out using a
ray-tracing software, ZEMAX and a full Physical Optics software, GRASP9.3,
applied to three different telescope designs that span a factor of $\simeq 10
in terms of D/lambda. The maximum measured discrepancy between phase efficiency
and Strehl ratio varies between $\simeq 0.4 and 1.9 up to an offset angle of
>40 beams, depending on the optical configuration, but it is always less than
0.5 where the Strehl ratio is >0.95.
"
What is the algebraic structure of a descent algebra over a field of characteristic zero?,"  The concept of descent algebras over a field of characteristic zero is
extended to define descent algebras over a field of prime characteristic. Some
basic algebraic structure of the latter, including its radical and irreducible
modules, is then determined. The decomposition matrix of the descent algebras
of Coxeter group types $A$, $B$, and $D$ are calculated, and used to derive a
description of the decomposition matrix of an arbitrary descent algebra. The
Cartan matrix of a variety of descent algebras over a finite field is then
obtained.
"
What is the new spinfoam vertex to be used in models of 4d quantum gravity?,"  We introduce a new spinfoam vertex to be used in models of 4d quantum gravity
based on SU(2) and SO(4) BF theory plus constraints. It can be seen as the
conventional vertex of SU(2) BF theory, the 15j symbol, in a particular basis
constructed using SU(2) coherent states. This basis makes the geometric
interpretation of the variables transparent: they are the vectors normal to the
triangles within each tetrahedron. We study the condition under which these
states can be considered semiclassical, and we show that the semiclassical ones
dominate the evaluation of quantum correlations. Finally, we describe how the
constraints reducing BF to gravity can be directly written in terms of the new
variables, and how the semiclassicality of the states might improve
understanding the correct way to implement the constraints.

What is the reason why the contributions of radiation reaction force in 2.5PN waveform are negligible?,"  In this Comment we compute the contributions of the radiation reaction force
in the 2.5 post-Newtonian (PN) gravitational wave polarizations for compact
binaries in circular orbits. (i) We point out and correct an inconsistency in
the derivation of Arun, Blanchet, Iyer, and Qusailah. (ii) We prove that all
contributions from radiation reaction in the 2.5PN waveform are actually
negligible since they can be absorbed into a modification of the orbital phase
at the 5PN order.
"
What are the allowed boundary conditions for the KK modes?,"  Recently the spectrum of KK modes in the framework of one flat
extra-dimensional scenario was revisited in the paper Phys. Rev. D74 (2006)
124013, (hep-th/0607246) on the basis of self-adjoint extension of the quantum
mechanical operator determining the KK masses. In this Letter we note that the
range of allowed boundary conditions on the KK modes is overestimated in above
mentioned paper and give all allowed possibilities.
"
What are the implications of hindered rotors on the decomposition rate of the largest biradicals in the studied cycloalkanes?,"  This work reports a theoretical study of the gas phase unimolecular
decomposition of cyclobutane, cyclopentane and cyclohexane by means of quantum
chemical calculations. A biradical mechanism has been envisaged for each
cycloalkane, and the main routes for the decomposition of the biradicals formed
have been investigated at the CBS-QB3 level of theory. Thermochemical data
(\delta H^0_f, S^0, C^0_p) for all the involved species have been obtained by
means of isodesmic reactions. The contribution of hindered rotors has also been
included. Activation barriers of each reaction have been analyzed to assess the
1 energetically most favorable pathways for the decomposition of biradicals.
Rate constants have been derived for all elementary reactions using transition
state theory at 1 atm and temperatures ranging from 600 to 2000 K. Global rate
constant for the decomposition of the cyclic alkanes in molecular products have
been calculated. Comparison between calculated and experimental results allowed
to validate the theoretical approach. An important result is that the
rotational barriers between the conformers, which are usually neglected, are of
importance in decomposition rate of the largest biradicals. Ring strain
energies (RSE) in transition states for ring opening have been estimated and
show that the main part of RSE contained in the cyclic reactants is removed
upon the activation process.
"
What are the implications of the information loss in the universe for the future of the universe?,"  The creation of spacetimes with horizons is discussed, focussing on baby
universes and black holes as examples. There is a complex interplay of quantum
theory and General Relativity in both cases, leading to consequences for the
future of the universe and the information loss paradox, and to a deeper
understanding of quantum gravity.
"
What are the properties of equations of this type?,"  We consider lattice equations on ${\mathds{Z}}^2$ which are autonomous,
affine linear and possess the symmetries of the square. Some basic properties
of equations of this type are derived, as well as a sufficient linearization
condition and a conservation law. A systematic analysis of the Lie point and
the generalized three- and five-point symmetries is presented. It leads to the
generic form of the symmetry generators of all the equations in this class,
which satisfy a certain non-degeneracy condition. Finally, symmetry reductions
of certain lattice equations to discrete analogues of the Painlev\'e equations
are considered.
"
What are the implications of the field population of low mass white dwarfs on stellar evolution and the search for planets around single low mass white dwarfs?,"  Low mass helium-core white dwarfs (M < 0.45 Msun) can be produced from
interacting binary systems, and traditionally all of them have been attributed
to this channel. However, a low mass white dwarf could also result from a
single star that experiences severe mass loss on the first ascent giant branch.
A large population of low mass He-core white dwarfs has been discovered in the
old metal-rich cluster NGC 6791. There is therefore a mechanism in clusters to
produce low mass white dwarfs without requiring binary star interactions, and
we search for evidence of a similar population in field white dwarfs. We argue
that there is a significant field population (of order half of the detected
systems) that arises from old metal rich stars which truncate their evolution
prior to the helium flash from severe mass loss. There is a consistent absence
of evidence for nearby companions in a large fraction of low mass white dwarfs.
The number of old metal-rich field dwarfs is also comparable with the
apparently single low mass white dwarf population, and our revised estimate for
the space density of low mass white dwarfs produced from binary interactions is
also compatible with theoretical expectations. This indicates that this channel
of stellar evolution, hitherto thought hypothetical only, has been in operation
in our own Galaxy for many billions of years. One strong implication of our
model is that single low mass white dwarfs should be good targets for planet
searches because they are likely to arise from metal-rich progenitors. We also
discuss other observational tests and implications, including the potential
impact on SN Ia rates and the frequency of planetary nebulae.

"What is the substate theorem in the context of quantum states, and what does it imply about relative entropy?","  We prove the following theorem about relative entropy of quantum states.
""Substate theorem: Let rho and sigma be quantum states in the same Hilbert
space with relative entropy S(rho|sigma) = Tr rho (log rho - log sigma) = c.
Then for all epsilon > 0, there is a state rho' such that the trace distance
||rho' - rho||_t = Tr sqrt{(rho' - rho)^2} <= epsilon, and
rho'/2^{O(c/epsilon^2)} <= sigma.""
  It states that if the relative entropy of rho and sigma is small, then there
is a state rho' close to rho, i.e. with small trace distance ||rho' - rho||_t,
that when scaled down by a factor 2^{O(c)} `sits inside', or becomes a
`substate' of, sigma. This result has several applications in quantum
communication complexity and cryptography. Using the substate theorem, we
derive a privacy trade-off for the set membership problem in the two-party
quantum communication model. Here Alice is given a subset A of [n], Bob an
input i in [n], and they need to determine if i in A.
  ""Privacy trade-off for set membership: In any two-party quantum communication
protocol for the set membership problem, if Bob reveals only k bits of
information about his input, then Alice must reveal at least n/2^{O(k)} bits of
information about her input.""
  We also discuss relationships between various information theoretic
quantities that arise naturally in the context of the substate theorem.
"
What is the effect of zero modes in the lattice spectral functions on the calculation of quarkonium Euclidean correlators?,"  We update our recent calculation of quarkonium Euclidean correlators at
finite temperatures in a potential model by including the effect of zero modes
in the lattice spectral functions. These contributions cure most of the
previously observed discrepancies with lattice calculations, supporting the use
of potential models at finite temperature as an important tool to complement
lattice studies.
"
What is the Leray Theory used in the first part of the paper?,"  The article consist of two main parts: an analog of the Leray Theory for
Singular Varieties and its application to the Theory of Parshin's Residues. The
first part is independent from the second. It uses the theory of Whitney
stratifications. The second part is an application of the first. In particular,
a geometric and very transparent proof of the Parshin's Reciprocity Law for
residues is given.
"
"What is the Lambda-CDM cosmological model used to predict the evolution of the galaxy luminosity function, number counts and redshift distributions in the IR?","  We present predictions for the evolution of the galaxy luminosity function,
number counts and redshift distributions in the IR based on the Lambda-CDM
cosmological model. We use the combined GALFORM semi-analytical galaxy
formation model and GRASIL spectrophotometric code to compute galaxy SEDs
including the reprocessing of radiation by dust. The model, which is the same
as that in Baugh et al (2005), assumes two different IMFs: a normal solar
neighbourhood IMF for quiescent star formation in disks, and a very top-heavy
IMF in starbursts triggered by galaxy mergers. We have shown previously that
the top-heavy IMF seems to be necessary to explain the number counts of faint
sub-mm galaxies. We compare the model with observational data from the SPITZER
Space Telescope, with the model parameters fixed at values chosen before
SPITZER data became available. We find that the model matches the observed
evolution in the IR remarkably well over the whole range of wavelengths probed
by SPITZER. In particular, the SPITZER data show that there is strong evolution
in the mid-IR galaxy luminosity function over the redshift range z ~ 0-2, and
this is reproduced by our model without requiring any adjustment of parameters.
On the other hand, a model with a normal IMF in starbursts predicts far too
little evolution in the mid-IR luminosity function, and is therefore excluded.
"
What is the Dirac equation for a bound electron in an external electromagnetic field?,"  Within the framework of Lorentz-violating extended electrodynamics, the Dirac
equation for a bound electron in an external electromagnetic field is
considered assuming the interaction with a CPT-odd axial vector background
$b_\mu$. The quasi-relativistic Hamiltonian is obtained using a $1/c$-series
expansion. Relativistic Dirac eigenstates in a spherically-symmetric potential
are found accurate up to the second order in $b_0$. $b_0$-induced CPT-odd
corrections to the electromagnetic dipole moment operators of a bound electron
are calculated that contribute to the anapole moment of the atomic orbital and
may cause a specific asymmetry of the angular distribution of the radiation of
a hydrogen atom.
"
What are the conditions under which localized spin 1/2 and 3/2 fermions can be obtained?,"  By using the self-dual vortex background on extra two-dimensional Riemann
surfaces in 5+1 dimensions, the localization mechanism of bulk fermions on a
string-like defect with the exponentially decreasing warp-factor is obtained.
We give the conditions under which localized spin 1/2 and 3/2 fermions can be
obtained.
"
What is the effect of the carbon-carbon interactions in γ-iron on the crystal structure of the γ-iron?,"  Local perturbations of crystal and magnetic structure of $\gamma$-iron near
carbon interstitial impurity is investigated by {\it ab initio} electronic
structure calculations. It is shown that the carbon impurity creates locally a
region of ferromagnetic ordering with substantial tetragonal distortions.
Exchange integrals and solution enthalpy are calculated, the latter being in a
very good agreement with experimental data. Effect of the local distortions on
the carbon-carbon interactions in $\gamma$-iron is discussed.
"
What are the conditions for the Boussinesq equations for Rayleigh-Benard convection in a cylindrical container with an aspect ratio near 1.5 to be stable?,"  The Boussinesq equations for Rayleigh-Benard convection are simulated for a
cylindrical container with an aspect ratio near 1.5. The transition from an
axisymmetric stationary flow to time-dependent flows is studied using nonlinear
simulations, linear stability analysis and bifurcation theory. At a Rayleigh
number near 25,000, the axisymmetric flow becomes unstable to standing or
travelling azimuthal waves. The standing waves are slightly unstable to
travelling waves. This scenario is identified as a Hopf bifurcation in a system
with O(2) symmetry.
"
What are the properties of superconducting correlations in disordered thin films?,"  Properties of disordered thin films are discussed based on the viewpoint that
superconducting islands are formed in the system. These lead to superconducting
correlations confined in space, which are known to form spontaneously in thin
films. Application of a perpendicular magnetic field can drive the system from
the superconducting state (characterized by phase-rigidity between the sample
edges) to an insulating state in which there are no phase-correlations between
the edges of the system. On the insulating side the existence of
superconducting islands leads to a non-monotonic magnetoresistance. Several
other features seen in experiment are explained.
"
What is the homogeneity exponent of the correlation function for aggregation models?,"  We study mass fluxes in aggregation models where mass transfer to large
scales by aggregation occurs alongside desorption or fragmentation. Two models
are considered. (1) A system of diffusing, aggregating particles with influx
and outflux of particles (in-out model) (2) A system of diffusing aggregating
particles with fragmentation (chipping model). Both these models can exist in
phases where probability distributions are power laws. In these power law
phases, we argue that the two point correlation function should have a certain
homogeneity exponent. These arguments are based on the exact constant flux
scaling valid for simple aggregation with input. Predictions are compared with
Monte Carlo simulations.
"
What is the nature of the absorption lines observed in the optical spectrum of J0644+3344?,"  We report on the discovery of J0644+3344, a bright deeply eclipsing
cataclysmic variable (CV) binary. Spectral signatures of both binary components
and an accretion disk can be seen at optical wavelengths. The optical spectrum
shows broad H I, He I, and He II accretion disk emission lines with deep narrow
absorption components from H I, He I, Mg II and Ca II. The absorption lines are
seen throughout the orbital period, disappearing only during primary eclipse.
These absorption lines are either the the result of an optically-thick inner
accretion disk or from the photosphere of the primary star. Radial velocity
measurements show that the H I, He I, and Mg II absorption lines phase with the
the primary star, while weak absorption features in the continuum phase with
the secondary star. Radial velocity solutions give a 150+/-4 km/s
semi-amplitude for the primary star and 192.8+/-5.6 km/s for the secondary. The
individual stellar masses are 0.63-0.69 Mdot for the primary and 0.49-0.54 Mdot
for the secondary. The bright eclipsing nature of this binary has helped
provide masses for both components with an accuracy rarely achieved for CVs.
This binary most closely resembles a nova-like UX UMa or SW Sex type of CV.
J0644+3344, however, has a longer orbital period than most UX UMa or SW Sex
stars. Assuming an evolution toward shorter orbital periods, J0644+3344 is
therefore likely to be a young interacting binary. The secondary star is
consistent with the size and spectral type of a K8 star, but has an M0 mass.
"
How was the helical state in patterned multilayer nanomagnets created?,"  We demonstrate the existence of a helical state in patterned multilayer
nanomagnets. The artificial helimagnets consist of a stack of single domain
ferromagnetic disks separated by insulating nonmagnetic spacers. The spiral
state is shown to originate from the magnetostatic interaction between nearest
and next nearest neighbouring single-domain disks in the stack. Since the
magnetostatic interaction for such disks is rather strong, the helical state
should be stable at room temperature. The helimagnets were fabricated from a
[Co/Si]*3 multilayer using electron beam lithography. The helical state was
confirmed by a magnetic stray field analysis using magnetic force microscopy.
"
What are the 8 types of wave propagation modes in elastic metamaterials?,"  We develop a dynamical effective medium theory to accurately predict the
unusual properties of elastic metamaterials in two dimensions near the resonant
frequencies. The theory shows that the effective bulk modulus, shear modulus,
and mass density can be made negative by choosing proper resonant scatterers,
leading to 8 possible types of wave propagation. The theory not only provides a
convenient tool to search for various metamaterials with desired properties,
but also gives a unified physical picture of these properties. Here we
demonstrate two examples. One possesses large band gaps at low frequencies. The
other exhibits two regions of negative refraction: one for both longitudinal
and transverse waves and the other for longitudinal waves only.
"
We calculate the local Fourier transforms for formal connections. What is the relationship between the conjecture of Laumon and the local Fourier transform?,"  We calculate the local Fourier transforms for formal connections. In
particular, we verify an analogous conjecture suggested in Laumon's paper:
""Transformation de Fourier, constantes d'equations fonctionnelles et conjecture
de Weil, 2.6.3"".
"
Can coarse-graining of complex networks be used to reduce the complexity of large systems?,"  Reducing the complexity of large systems described as complex networks is key
to understand them and a crucial issue is to know which properties of the
initial system are preserved in the reduced one. Here we use random walks to
design a coarse-graining scheme for complex networks. By construction the
coarse-graining preserves the slow modes of the walk, while reducing
significantly the size and the complexity of the network. In this sense our
coarse-graining allows to approximate large networks by smaller ones, keeping
most of their relevant spectral properties.
"
What are the implications of the dependency structure in a dependency graph G?,"  In this note we prove a large deviation bound on the sum of random variables
with the following dependency structure: there is a dependency graph $G$ with a
bounded chromatic number, in which each vertex represents a random variable.
Variables that are represented by neighboring vertices may be arbitrarily
dependent, but collections of variables that form an independent set in $G$ are
$t$-wise independent.
"
What are the properties of colouring polynomials in relation to Yang-Baxter invariants and quandle 2-cocycle invariants?,"  This article introduces a natural extension of colouring numbers of knots,
called colouring polynomials, and studies their relationship to Yang-Baxter
invariants and quandle 2-cocycle invariants.
  For a knot K in the 3-sphere let \pi_K be the fundamental group of the knot
complement, and let (m_K,l_K) be a meridian-longitude pair in \pi_K. Given a
finite group G and an element x in G, we consider the set of representations
\rho from \pi_K to G that map the meridian m_K to x, and define the colouring
polynomial P(K) as the sum over all longitude images \rho(l_K). The resulting
invariant maps knots to the group ring Z[G]. It is multiplicative with respect
to connected sum and equivariant with respect to symmetry operations of knots.
Examples are given to show that colouring polynomials distinguish knots for
which other invariants fail, in particular they can distinguish knots from
their mutants, obverses, inverses, or reverses.
  We prove that every quandle 2-cocycle state-sum invariant of knots is a
specialization of some knot colouring polynomial. This provides a complete
topological interpretation of these invariants in terms of the knot group and
its peripheral system. Furthermore, we show that P can be presented as a
Yang-Baxter invariant, i.e. as the trace of some linear braid group
representation. This entails in particular that Yang-Baxter invariants can
detect non-inversible and non-reversible knots.
"
What are the properties of n-by-n circulant matrices with entries 0 and 1?,"  We consider n-by-n circulant matrices having entries 0 and 1. Such matrices
can be identified with sets of residues mod n, corresponding to the columns in
which the top row contains an entry 1. Let A and B be two such matrices, and
suppose that the corresponding residue sets S_A and S_B have size at most 3. We
prove that the following are equivalent: (1) there are integers u,v mod n, with
u a unit, such that S_A = uS_B + v; (2) there are permutation matrices P,Q such
that A=PBQ. Our proof relies on some new results about vanishing sums of roots
of unity. We give examples showing this result is not always true for denser
circulants, as well as results showing it continues to hold in some situations.
We also explain how our problem relates to the Adam problem on isomorphisms of
circulant directed graphs.
"
What are the implications of R-parity violating operators in a model with family symmetry?,"  In this talk, we investigate the implications of R-parity violating (RPV)
operators in a model with family symmetry. Family symmetry can determine the
form of RPV operators as well as the Yukawa matrices. We consider a concrete
model with non-abelian discrete symmetry Q_6, which has only three RPV
trilinear operators with no baryon number violating terms. We find that ratios
of decay rates of the lepton flavor violating processes are fixed thanks to the
family symmetry, predicting BR(tau to 3e)/BR(tau to 3mu) ~ 4
m_{mu}^2/m_{tau}^2.
"
What is the natural algebraic security criterion for network coding in scenarios with eavesdropping nodes?,"  We consider the level of information security provided by random linear
network coding in network scenarios in which all nodes comply with the
communication protocols yet are assumed to be potential eavesdroppers (i.e.
""nice but curious""). For this setup, which differs from wiretapping scenarios
considered previously, we develop a natural algebraic security criterion, and
prove several of its key properties. A preliminary analysis of the impact of
network topology on the overall network coding security, in particular for
complete directed acyclic graphs, is also included.
"
"What is the proposed mechanism behind the magnetoresistance effect in the trilayers, and what role does magnetostatic coupling play?","  We report on the transport and magnetic properties of hybrid trilayers and
bilayers that consist of low spin-polarized Ni80Fe20 exhibiting in-plane but no
uniaxial anisotropy and low-Tc Nb. We reveal a magnetoresistance effect that is
pronounced. In our trilayers the magnetoresistance exhibits an increase of two
orders of magnitude when the superconducting state is reached: from the
conventional normal-state values 0.6 % it goes up to 1000 % for temperatures
below Tc. In contrast, in the bilayers the effect is only minor since from 3%
in the normal state increases only to 70 % for temperatures below Tc.
Magnetization data of both the longitudinal and transverse magnetic components
are presented. Most importantly, we present data not only for the normal state
of Nb but also in its superconducting state. Strikingly, these data show that
below its Tc SC the Nb interlayer under the influence of the outer Ni80Fe20
layers attains a magnetization component transverse to the external field. By
comparing the transport and magnetization data we propose a candidate mechanism
that could motivate the pronounced magnetoresistance effect observed in the
trilayers. Adequate magnetostatic coupling of the outer Ni80Fe20 layers is
motivated by stray fields that emerge naturally in their whole surface due to
the multidomain magnetic structure that they attain near coercivity. Atomic
force microscopy is employed in order to examine the possibility that such
magnetostatic coupling could be promoted by interface roughness. Referring to
the bilayers, although out-of-plane rotation of the magnetization of the single
Ni80Fe20 layer is still observed, in these structures magnetostatic coupling
does not occur due to the absence of a second Ni80Fe20 one so that the observed
magnetoresistance peaks are only modest.
"
What are the solutions to the Bethe-Salpeter equation for the massless bound states of two fermions with equal masses and the electromagnetic interaction between them?,"  It is known that in the ladder approximation the relativistic two-fermion
bound-state equation of Bethe and Salpeter has solutions corresponding to the
binding energy equal to the total mass of the particles. The study of these
massless states has been carried out only for the bound system at rest. Of
course, such composite boson can not be in the state of rest. But it is more
importantly that this approach for the massless boson can not be interpreted as
the limiting case of a nonzero mass system because the phase velocity of the
boson wave must equal to the speed of light. Using the Bethe-Salpeter equation
in the ladder approximation, we have obtained the wave equation for the
massless bound states of two fermions with equal masses and the electromagnetic
interaction between them. Neglecting retardation of the interaction, solutions
corresponded to the stationary wave states of the composite boson, have been
found. The boson wave function can be represented as an infinite, straight
thread, the transverse radius of which is more than the Compton wavelength of
the fermion. Two energy branches of the bosons with quantized energies have
been determined. The appearance of these branches is due to the strong
renormalization of the fine structure constant for the massless states.
"
What are the estimates of ground state energies and excitation gaps for FQH filling fractions ν = 1/3 and ν = 5/2?,"  We develop the Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) technique for
numerically studying incompressible fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states on the
sphere. We calculate accurate estimates for ground state energies and
excitationgaps at FQH filling fractions \nu=1/3 and \nu=5/2 for systems that
are almost twice as large as the largest ever studied by exact diagonalization.
We establish, by carefully comparing with existing numerical results on smaller
systems, that DMRG is a highly effective numerical tool for studying
incompressible FQH states.
"
What are the implications of the deformation of one-dimensional systems with boundaries?,"  For a general self-adjoint Hamiltonian operator $H_0$ on the Hilbert space
$L^2(\RE^d)$, we determine the set of all self-adjoint Hamiltonians $H$ on
$L^2(\RE^d)$ that dynamically confine the system to an open set $\Omega \subset
\RE^d$ while reproducing the action of $ H_0$ on an appropriate operator
domain. In the case $H_0=-\Delta +V$ we construct these Hamiltonians explicitly
showing that they can be written in the form $H=H_0+ B$, where $B$ is a
singular boundary potential and $H$ is self-adjoint on its maximal domain. An
application to the deformation quantization of one-dimensional systems with
boundaries is also presented.
"
What is the gauge coupling unification near the Planck scale in the context of supersymmetry?,"  We show how gauge coupling unification near the Planck scale $M_P\sim
10^{19}$ GeV can be achieved in the framework of supersymmetry, facilitating a
full unification of all forces with gravity. Below the conventional GUT scale
$M_{GUT}\sim 10^{16}$ GeV physics is described by a Supersymmetric Standard
Model whose particle content is that of three complete $\mathbf{27}$
representations of the gauge group $E_6$. Above the conventional GUT scale the
gauge group corresponds to a left-right symmetric Supersymmetric Pati-Salam
model, which may be regarded as a ``surrogate SUSY GUT'' with all the nice
features of SO(10) but without proton decay or doublet-triplet splitting
problems. At the TeV scale the extra exotic states may be discovered at the
LHC, providing an observable footprint of an underlying $E_6$ gauge group
broken at the Planck scale. Assuming an additional low energy $U(1)_X$ gauge
group, identified as a non-trivial combination of diagonal $E_6$ generators,
the $\mu$ problem of the MSSM can be resolved.
"
What are the implications of D-brane instantons in quivers for the interpretation of gauge theory effects?,"  D-brane instantons can perturb the quantum field theories on space-time
filling D-branes by interesting operators. In some cases, these D-brane
instantons are novel ""stringy"" effects (not interpretable directly as instanton
effects in the low-energy quantum field theory), while in others the D-brane
instantons can be directly interpreted as field theory effects. In this note,
we describe a situation where both perspectives are available, by studying
stringy instantons in quivers which arise at simple Calabi-Yau singularities.
We show that a stringy instanton which wraps an unoccupied node of the quiver,
and gives rise to a non-perturbative mass in the space-time field theory, can
be reinterpreted as a conventional gauge theory effect by going up in an
appropriate renormalization group cascade. Interestingly, in the cascade, the
contribution of the stringy instanton does not come from gauge theory
instantons but from strong coupling dynamics.
"
What are the equations of motion for binary systems with spin-orbit coupling?,"  We study gravitational radiation reaction in the equations of motion for
binary systems with spin-orbit coupling, at order (v/c)^7 beyond Newtonian
gravity, or O(v/c)^2 beyond the leading radiation reaction effects for
non-spinning bodies. We use expressions for the energy and angular momentum
flux at infinity that include spin-orbit corrections, together with an
assumption of energy and angular momentum balance, to derive equations of
motion that are valid for general orbits and for a class of coordinate gauges.
We show that the equations of motion are compatible with those derived earlier
by a direct calculation.
"
"What are the limiting values of the second, third, and so on, largest eigenvalues of the ensembles in question?","  For a broad class of unitary ensembles of random matrices we demonstrate the
universal nature of the Janossy densities of eigenvalues near the spectral
edge, providing a different formulation of the probability distributions of the
limiting second, third, etc. largest eigenvalues of the ensembles in question.
The approach is based on a representation of the Janossy densities in terms of
a system of orthogonal polynomials, plus the steepest descent method of Deift
and Zhou for the asymptotic analysis of the associated Riemann-Hilbert problem.
"
What is the accretion of the intergalactic medium onto the gaseous disc used to explain the generation of galactic warps?,"  The accretion of the intergalactic medium onto the gaseous disc is used to
explain the generation of galactic warps. A cup-shaped distortion is expected,
due to the transmission of the linear momentum; but, this effect is small for
most incident inflow angles and the predominant effect turns out to be the
transmission of angular momentum, i.e. a torque giving an integral-sign shaped
warp. The torque produced by a flow of velocity ~100 km/s and baryon density
~10^{-25} kg/m^3, which is within the possible values for the intergalactic
medium, is enough to generate the observed warps and this mechanism offers
quite a plausible explanation. The inferred rate of infall of matter, ~1
M_sun/yr, to the Galactic disc that this theory predicts agrees with the
quantitative predictions of chemical evolution resolving key issues, notably
the G-dwarf problem.
  Sanchez-Salcedo (2006) suggests that this mechanism is not plausible because
it would produce a dependence of the scaleheight of the disc with the
Galactocentric azimuth in the outer disc, but rather than being an objection
this is another argument in favour of the mechanism because this dependence is
actually observed in our Galaxy.
"
What are the implications of the increased gamma-ray flux in the flare of a blazar?,"  In July 2007, the blazar 3C 454.3 underwent a flare in the optical, reaching
R~13 on July 19. Then the optical flux decreased by one magnitude, being R~14
when the source was detected by the gamma-ray satellite AGILE, that observed
the source on July 24-30. At the same time, the Swift satellite performed a
series of snapshots. We can construct the simultaneous spectral energy
distribution using optical, UV, X-ray and gamma-ray data. These shows that an
increased gamma-ray flux is accompanied by a weaker optical/X-ray flux with
respect to the flare observed in the Spring 2005 by INTEGRAL and Swift. This
confirms earlier suggestions about the behaviour of the jet of 3C 454.3.
"
What are the characteristics of the separation $\sigma_{l-1 l+1}(n)$?,"  Aims. The purpose of this work is to investigate a new frequency separation
of stellar p-modes and its characteristics. Methods. Frequency separations are
deduced from the asymptotic formula of stellar p-modes. Then, using the
theoretical adiabatic frequencies of stellar model, we compute the frequency
separations. Results. A new separation $\sigma_{l-1 l+1}(n)$, which is similar
to the scaled small separation $d_{l l+2}(n)/(2l+3)$, is obtained from the
asymptotic formula of stellar p-modes. The separations $\sigma_{l-1 l+1}(n)$
and $d_{l l+2}(n)/(2l+3)$ have the same order. And like the small separation,
$\sigma_{l-1 l+1}(n)$ is mainly sensitive to the conditions in the stellar
core. However, with the decrease of the central hydrogen abundance of stars,
the $\sigma_{02}$ and $\sigma_{13}$ more and more deviate from the scaled small
separation. This characteristic could be used to extract the information on the
central hydrogen abundance of stars.
"
What are the implications of the distinct kinematic populations of optical knots in the SN remnant 3C 58 for the progenitors of the SNRs most similar to 3C 58?,"  We discuss the findings of a comprehensive imaging and spectroscopic survey
of the optical emission associated with the supernova remnant 3C 58 (Fesen et
al. 2007) as they relate to the topic of pre-SN mass loss. Spectroscopically
measured radial velocities of ~450 emission knots within the remnant show two
distinct kinematic populations of optical knots: a high-velocity group with
radial velocities in the range of 700 - 1100 km/s and a lower velocity group
exhibiting radial expansion velocities below ~250 km/s. We interpret the
high-velocity knots as ejecta from the SN explosion and the low-velocity knots
as shocked circumstellar material likely resulting from pre-SN mass loss. The
chemical signatures of the two populations also show marked differences. The
high velocity group includes a substantial number of knots with notably higher
[N II]/H-alpha ratios not seen in the lower velocity population, suggesting
greater nitrogen enrichment in the SN ejecta than in the CSM. These results are
compared with evidence for pre-SN mass loss in the Crab Nebula, perhaps the SNR
most similar to 3C 58. These SNRs may comprise two case studies of pre-SN mass
loss in relatively low mass (~8 - 10 solar masses) core-collapse SN
progenitors.

What are the characteristics of the distribution of dark matter substructures in the Milky Way?,"  The annihilation of dark matter (DM) in the Galaxy could produce specific
imprints on the spectra of antimatter species in Galactic cosmic rays, which
could be detected by upcoming experiments such as PAMELA and AMS02. Recent
studies show that the presence of substructures can enhance the annihilation
signal by a ""boost factor"" that not only depends on energy, but that is
intrinsically a statistical property of the distribution of DM substructures
inside the Milky Way. We investigate a scenario in which substructures consist
of $\sim 100$ ""mini-spikes"" around intermediate-mass black holes. Focusing on
primary positrons and antiprotons, we find large boost factors, up to a few
thousand, that exhibit a large variance at high energy in the case of positrons
and at low energy in the case of antiprotons. As a consequence, an estimate of
the DM particle mass based on the observed cut-off in the positron spectrum
could lead to a substantial underestimate of its actual value.
"
What are the areas where the perturbed solution of the periodic Toda lattice is close to a modulated lattice?,"  We consider the stability of the periodic Toda lattice (and slightly more
generally of the algebro-geometric finite-gap lattice) under a short range
perturbation. We prove that the perturbed lattice asymptotically approaches a
modulated lattice.
  More precisely, let $g$ be the genus of the hyperelliptic curve associated
with the unperturbed solution. We show that, apart from the phenomenon of the
solitons travelling on the quasi-periodic background, the $n/t$-pane contains
$g+2$ areas where the perturbed solution is close to a finite-gap solution in
the same isospectral torus. In between there are $g+1$ regions where the
perturbed solution is asymptotically close to a modulated lattice which
undergoes a continuous phase transition (in the Jacobian variety) and which
interpolates between these isospectral solutions. In the special case of the
free lattice ($g=0$) the isospectral torus consists of just one point and we
recover the known result.
  Both the solutions in the isospectral torus and the phase transition are
explicitly characterized in terms of Abelian integrals on the underlying
hyperelliptic curve.
  Our method relies on the equivalence of the inverse spectral problem to a
matrix Riemann--Hilbert problem defined on the hyperelliptic curve and
generalizes the so-called nonlinear stationary phase/steepest descent method
for Riemann--Hilbert problem deformations to Riemann surfaces.
"
What are the motions of the two galaxies measured by VLBI observations?,"  This article presents results of VLBI observations of regions of H2O maser
activity in the Local Group galaxies M33 and IC10. Since all position
measurements were made relative to extragalactic background sources, the proper
motions of the two galaxies could be measured. For M33, this provides this
galaxy's three dimensional velocity, showing that this galaxy is moving with a
velocity of 190 +/- 59 km\s relative to the Milky Way. For IC10, we obtain a
motion of 215 +/- 42 km/s relative to the Milky Way. These measurements promise
a new handle on dynamical models for the Local Group and the mass and dark
matter halo of Andromeda and the Milky Way.

"What methods were used to study the electronic structure, magnetic, and optical properties of bcc FeCr alloys in the ferromagnetic phase?","  In this communication we have studied the electronic structure, magnetic and
optical properties of bcc \fecr alloys in the ferromagnetic phase. We have used
the augmented space recursion technique coupled with tight-binding linearized
muffin-tin orbital technique (TB-LMTO-ASR) as well as the coherent-potential
approximation based on the Korringa-Kohn-Rostocker method (KKR-CPA). Also the
plane wave projector augmented wave (PAW) method has been used with the
disorder simulated by the special quasi-random structure method f or
configuration averaging (SQS). This was to provide a comparison between the
different methods in common use for random alloys. Moreover, using the
self-consistent potential parameters from TB-LMTO-ASR ca lculations we obtained
the spin resolved optical conductivity using the generalized recursion
technique proposed by M\""uller and Vishwanathan.
"
What is the relationship between Chern classes of a vector bundle and its canonical extensions?,"  The $L^2$-cohomology of a locally symmetric variety is known to have the
topological interpretation as the intersection homology of its Baily-Borel
Satake compactification. In this article, we observe that even without the
Hermitian hypothesis, the $L^p$-cohomology of an arithmetic quotient, for $p$
finite and sufficiently large, is isomorphic to the ordinary cohomology of its
reductive Borel-Serre compactification. We use this to generalize a theorem of
Mumford concerning homogeneous vector bundles, their invariant Chern forms and
the canonical extensions of the bundles; here, though, we are referring to
canonical extensions to the reductive Borel-Serre compactification of any
arithmetic quotient. To achieve that, we give a systematic discussion of vector
bundles and Chern classes on stratified
"
What is the significance of the high spatial resolution maps of the L1157 outflow obtained with the Plateau de Bure Interferometer?,"  We present high spatial resolution maps, obtained with the Plateau de Bure
Interferometer, of the blue lobe of the L1157 outflow. We observed four lines
at 3 mm, namely CH3OH (2_K-1_K), HC3N (11-10), HCN (1-0) and OCS (7-6).
Moreover, the bright B1 clump has also been observed at better spatial
resolution in CS (2-1), CH3OH (2_1-1_1)A-, and 34SO (3_2-2_1). These high
spatial resolution observations show a very rich structure in all the tracers,
revealing a clumpy structure of the gas superimposed to an extended emission.
In fact, the three clumps detected by previous IRAM-30m single dish
observations have been resolved into several sub-clumps and new clumps have
been detected in the outflow. The clumps are associated with the two cavities
created by two shock episodes driven by the precessing jet. In particular, the
clumps nearest the protostar are located at the walls of the younger cavity
with a clear arch-shape form while the farthest clumps have slightly different
observational characteristics indicating that they are associated to the older
shock episode. The emission of the observed species peaks in different part of
the lobe: the east clumps are brighter in HC3N (11-10), HCN (1-0) and CS (2-1)
while the west clumps are brighter in CH3OH(2_K-1_K), OCS (7-6) and 34SO
(3_2-2_1). This peak displacement in the line emission suggests a variation of
the physical conditions and/or the chemical composition along the lobe of the
outflow at small scale, likely related to the shock activity and the precession
of the outflow. In particular, we observe the decoupling of the silicon
monoxide and methanol emission, common shock tracers, in the B1 clump located
at the apex of the bow shock produced by the second shock episode.
"
"What is the significance of the ""silicate-break"" galaxies detected in the NEP-Deep and Wide surveys?","  We present an initial analysis of AKARI 18um-selected galaxies using all 9
photometric bands at 2-24um available in the InfraRed Camera (IRC), in order to
demonstrate new capabilities of AKARI cosmological surveys. We detected 72
sources at 18um in an area of 50.2 arcmin^2 in the AKARI/IRC monitor field
towards the North Ecliptic Pole (NEP). From this sample, 25 galaxies with
probable redshifts z>~ 0.5 are selected with a single colour cut (N2-N3>0.1)
for a detailed SED analysis with ground-based BVRi'z'JK data. Using an SED
radiative transfer model of starbursts covering the wavelength range UV --
submm, we derive photometric redshifts from the optical-MIR SEDs of
18um-selected galaxies. From the best-fit SED models, we show that the IRC
all-band photometry is capable of tracing the steep rise in flux at the blue
side of the PAH 6.2um emission feature. This indicates that the IRC all-band
photometry is useful to constrain the redshift of infrared galaxies,
specifically for dusty galaxies with a less prominent 4000A break. Also, we
find that the flux dip between the PAH 7.7 and 11.2um emission feature is
recognizable in the observed SEDs of galaxies at z~1. By using such a colour
anomaly due to the PAH and silicate absorption features, unique samples of
ULIRGs at z~1, `silicate-break' galaxies, can be constructed from large
cosmological surveys of AKARI towards the NEP, i.e. the NEP-Deep and NEP-Wide
survey. This pilot study suggests the possibility of detecting many interesting
galaxy properties in the NEP-Deep and Wide surveys, such as a systematic
difference in SEDs between high- and low-z ULIRGs, and a large variation of the
PAH inter-band strength ratio in galaxies at high redshifts. [abridged]
"
How is the hidden SU(2) gauge symmetry related to the topological properties of the model?,"  We construct an exactly soluble spin-$\frac{1}2$ model on a honeycomb
lattice, which is a generalization of Kitaev model. The topological phases of
the system are analyzed by study of the ground state sector of this model, the
vortex-free states. Basically, there are two phases, A phase and B phase. The
behaviors of both A and B phases may be studied by mapping the ground state
sector into a general p-wave paired states of spinless fermions with tunable
pairing parameters on a square lattice. In this p-wave paired state theory, the
A phase is shown to be the strong paired phase, an insulating phase. The B
phase may be either gapped or gapless determined by the generalized inversion
symmetry is broken or not. The gapped B is the weak pairing phase described by
either the Moore-Read Pfaffian state of the spinless fermions or anti-Pfaffian
state of holes depending on the sign of the next nearest neighbor hopping
amplitude. A phase transition between Pfaffian and anti-Pfaffian states are
found in the gapped B phase. Furthermore, we show that there is a hidden SU(2)
gauge symmetry in our model. In the gapped B phase, the ground state has a
non-trivial topological number, the spectral first Chern number or the chiral
central charge, which reflects the chiral anomaly of the edge state. We proved
that the topological number is identified to the reduced eta-invariant and this
anomaly may be cancelled by a bulk Wess-Zumino term of SO(3) group through an
index theorem in 2+1 dimensions.
"
What are the implications of isomorphic sub-representations for the classification of small dimension?,"  We study holonomy representations admitting a pair of supplementary faithful
sub-representations. In particular the cases where the sub-representations are
isomorphic respectively dual to each other are treated. In each case we have a
closer look at the classification in small dimension.
"
What are the prospects of detecting terrestrial-mass Trojans using ground-based observatories?,"  Theoretical studies predict that Trojans are likely a frequent byproduct of
planet formation and evolution. We examine the sensitivity of transit timing
observations for detecting Trojan companions to transiting extrasolar planets.
We demonstrate that this method offers the potential to detect terrestrial-mass
Trojans using existing ground-based observatories. We compare the transit
timing variation (TTV) method with other techniques for detecting extrasolar
Trojans and outline the future prospects for this method.
"
What are the implications of the Taub-Bolt metric in the Ricci flow for the Euclidean action landscape?,"  We use the Ricci flow with surgery to study four-dimensional SU(2) x
U(1)-symmetric metrics on a manifold with fixed boundary given by a squashed
3-sphere. Depending on the initial metric we show that the flow converges to
either the Taub-Bolt or the Taub-NUT metric, the latter case potentially
requiring surgery at some point in the evolution. The Ricci flow allows us to
explore the Euclidean action landscape within this symmetry class. This work
extends the recent work of Headrick and Wiseman to more interesting topologies.
"
What are the invariant curves of two hyperbolic points in a billiard table?,"  In this paper we show that, under certain generic conditions, billiards on
ovals have only a finite number of periodic orbits, for each period, all
non-degenerate and at least one of them is hyperbolic. Moreover, the invariant
curves of two hyperbolic points are transversal. We explore these properties to
give some dynamical consequences specially about the dynamics in the
instability regions.
"
What is the time-dependent phenomenological model used to investigate the Λ-CDM cosmology?,"  A time-dependent phenomenological model of $\Lambda$, viz. $\dot \Lambda\sim
H^3$ is selected to investigate the $\Lambda$-CDM cosmology. Time-dependent
form of the equation of state parameter $\omega$ is derived and it has been
possible to obtain the sought for flip of sign of the deceleration parameter q.
Present age of the Universe, calculated for some specific values of the
parameters agrees very well with the observational data.
"
What is the geometric proof of the Thom conjecture?,"  This paper has been withdrawn by the author due a crucial sign error in
Theorem B. We present a geometric proof of Thom conjecture, which uses Khovanov
homology. Our approach doesn't use any analytic methods and is quite different
from proof given by Kronheimer and Mrowka in 1994.
"
What are the implications of accepting quantum mechanics as universally true?,"  I argue that accepting quantum mechanics to be universally true means that
you should also believe in parallel universes. I give my assessment of
Everett's theory as it celebrates its 50th anniversary.

"What are the observed expansion motions in the outer layers of the globule FeSt 1-457, and what is their origin?","  High resolution molecular line observations of CS, HCO+, C18O and N2H+ were
obtained toward the starless globule FeSt 1-457 in order to investigate its
kinematics and chemistry. The HCO+ and CS spectra show clear self-reversed and
asymmetric profiles across the face of the globule. The sense of the observed
asymmetry is indicative of the global presence of expansion motions in the
outer layers of the globule. These motions appear to be subsonic and
significantly below the escape velocity of the globule. Comparison of our
observations with near-infrared extinction data indicate that the globule is
gravitationally bound. Taken together these considerations lead us to suggest
that the observed expansion has its origin in an oscillatory motion of the
outer layers of the globule which itself is likely in a quasi-stable state near
hydrostatic equilibrium. Analysis of the observed linewidths of CO and N2H+
confirm that thermal pressure is the dominant component of the cloud's internal
support. A simple calculation suggests that the dominant mode of pulsation
would be an l = 2 mode with a period of 0.3 Myr. Deformation of the globule due
to the large amplitude l = 2 oscillation may be responsible for the
double-peaked structure of the core detected in high resolution extinction
maps. Detailed comparison of the molecular-line observations and extinction
data provides evidence for significant depletion of C18O and perhaps HCO+ while
N2H+ may be undepleted to a cloud depth of about 40 magnitudes of visual
extinction.
"
What is the context of teleparallel theory?,"  We show that the energy distribution of the brane-world black holes given by
Salti et al. in the context of teleparallel theory is not right. We give the
correct formula of energy of those black hole.
"
What is the Lie algebra T(g) and the tensor product of g with a ring of truncated polynomials?,"  Let g denote a Lie algebra, and let T(g) denote the tensor product of g with
a ring of truncated polynomials. The Lie algebra T(g) is called a truncated
current Lie algebra. The highest-weight representation theory of T(g) is
developed, and a reducibility criterion for the Verma modules is described.
"
What is the significance of the Tate-Shafarevich group in the context of a principal homogeneous space?,"  In this paper we present a new method to show that a principal homogeneous
space of the Jacobian of a curve of genus two is nontrivial. The idea is to
exhibit a Brauer-Manin obstruction to the existence of rational points on a
quotient of this principal homogeneous space. In an explicit example we apply
the method to show that a specific curve has infinitely many quadratic twists
whose Jacobians have nontrivial Tate-Shafarevich group.
"
What are the observational results of the study of the RCW 120 region?,"  To investigate the process of star formation triggered by the expansion of an
HII region, we present a multi-wavelength analysis of the Galactic HII region
RCW 120 and its surroundings. The collect and collapse model predicts that the
layer of gas and dust accumulated between the ionization and shock fronts
during the expansion of the HII region collapses and forms dense fragments,
giving rise to potential sites of massive-star formation. The aim of our study
is to look for such massive fragments and massive young stars on the borders of
RCW 120. We mapped the RCW 120 region in the cold dust continuum emission at
1.2 mm to search for these fragments. We supplemented this study with the
available near- (2MASS) and mid-IR (GLIMPSE) data to locate the IR sources
observed towards this region and to analyse their properties. We then compared
the observational results with the predictions of Hosokawa & Inutsuka's model
(2005, 2006). At 1.2 mm we detected eight fragments towards this region, five
located on its borders. The largest fragment has a mass of about 370 Msun.
Class I and Class II young stellar objects are detected all over the region,
with some observed far from the ionization front. This result emphasises the
possible importance distant interactions between the radiation, escaping from
the ionized region, and the surrounding medium.
"
Can isolated low-mass dwarf galaxies be used to test cold dark matter cosmology on small scales?,"  The galaxy circular velocity function at small masses is related to the
matter power spectrum on small scales. Although this function is well-studied
for Local Group dwarfs, theoretical predictions and observational measurements
are difficult for satellite galaxies, because of ram pressure and tidal
stripping. By contrast, isolated dwarf galaxies are less affected by these
processes, and almost always have enough 21cm emission to trace their dynamics
robustly. Here, we test cold dark matter cosmology using isolated low mass
dwarf galaxies from the SDSS with measured 21cm widths. We find consistency
between the predicted and observed number density of isolated galaxies down to
circular velocities of 50 km/s. Our technique yields a direct test of
small-scale cosmology independent of the Lyman-alpha forest power spectrum, but
our sample is currently statistically less powerful: warm dark matter particles
heavier than 0.5 keV cannot be ruled out. Our major systematic uncertainty is
the surface brightness limit of the SDSS. Blind HI surveys, such as the ALFALFA
survey on Arecibo, will uncover a larger number of isolated low mass galaxies
and increase the power of our constraints. With our sample, we also find that
the Tully-Fisher relation for dwarf galaxies is a strong function of
environment, and that the baryonic fraction is only a weak function of mass.
These results suggest that for dwarf galaxies, gas loss is dominated by
external, not internal, processes. [abridged]
"
"What is the role of Coulomb interaction and pairing correlations in the isospin-mixing parameter in the Tz=-1, Tz=0 and Tz=1 range?","  We calculate the isospin-mixing parameter for several Tz=-1, Tz=0 and Tz=1
nuclei from Mg to Sn in the particle-number conserving Higher Tamm-Dancoff
approach taking into account the pairing correlations. In particular we
investigate the role of the Coulomb interaction and the |Tz|=1 pairing
correlations. To do so the HTDA approach is implemented with the SIII Skyrme
effective nucleon-nucleon interaction in the mean-field channel and a delta
interaction in the pairing channel. We conclude from this investigation that
the pairing correlations bring a large contribution to isospin-symmetry
breaking, whereas the Coulomb interaction turns out to play a less important
role. Moreover we find that the isospin-mixing parameters for Tz=-1 and Tz=1
nuclei are comparable while they are about twice as large for Tz=0 nuclei
(between 3% and 6%, including doubly magic nuclei).
"
What is the relationship between the optical emission line properties of Brightest Cluster Galaxies (BCGs) and the properties of the galaxy and the host cluster?,"  We examine the optical emission line properties of Brightest Cluster Galaxies
(BCGs) selected from two large, homogeneous datasets. The first is the X-ray
selected National Optical Astronomy Observatory Fundamental Plane Survey
(NFPS), and the second is the C4 catalogue of optically selected clusters built
from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release ~3 (SDSS DR3). Our goal is to
better understand the optical line emission in BCGs with respect to properties
of the galaxy and the host cluster. Throughout the analysis we compare the line
emission of the BCGs to that of a control sample made of the other bright
galaxies near the cluster centre. Overall, both the NFPS and SDSS show a modest
fraction of BCGs with emission lines (~15%). No trend in the fraction of
emitting BCGs as a function of galaxy mass or cluster velocity dispersion is
found. However we find that, for those BCGs found in cooling flow clusters,
71^{+9}_{-14}% have optical emission. Furthermore, if we consider only BCGs
within 50kpc of the X-ray centre of a cooling flow cluster, the emission-line
fraction rises further to 100^{+0}_{-15}%. Excluding the cooling flow clusters,
only ~10% of BCGs are line emitting, comparable to the control sample of
galaxies. We show that the physical origin of the emission line activity
varies: in some cases it has LINER-like line ratios, whereas in others it is a
composite of star-formation and LINER-like activity. We conclude that the
presence of emission lines in BCGs is directly related to the cooling of X-ray
gas at the cluster centre.
"
What is the signature of infrared galaxy clustering observed at 160 microns?,"  We report the detection of correlated anisotropies in the Cosmic Far-Infrared
Background at 160 microns. We measure the power spectrum in the Spitzer/SWIRE
Lockman Hole field. It reveals unambiguously a strong excess above cirrus and
Poisson contributions, at spatial scales between 5 and 30 arcminutes,
interpreted as the signature of infrared galaxy clustering. Using our model of
infrared galaxy evolution we derive a linear bias b=1.74 \pm 0.16. It is a
factor 2 higher than the bias measured for the local IRAS galaxies. Our model
indicates that galaxies dominating the 160 microns correlated anisotropies are
at z~1. This implies that infrared galaxies at high redshifts are biased
tracers of mass, unlike in the local Universe.
"
What are the star-forming luminosity functions of the three types of AGN?,"  We describe observations of aromatic features at 7.7 and 11.3 um in AGN of
three types including PG, 2MASS and 3CR objects. The feature has been
demonstrated to originate predominantly from star formation. Based on the
aromatic-derived star forming luminosity, we find that the far-IR emission of
AGN can be dominated by either star formation or nuclear emission; the average
contribution from star formation is around 25% at 70 and 160 um. The
star-forming infrared luminosity functions of the three types of AGN are
flatter than that of field galaxies, implying nuclear activity and star
formation tend to be enhanced together. The star-forming luminosity function is
also a function of the strength of nuclear activity from normal galaxies to the
bright quasars, with luminosity functions becoming flatter for more intense
nuclear activity. Different types of AGN show different distributions in the
level of star formation activity, with 2MASS> PG> 3CR star formation rates.
"
What is the physically motivated parametrization for the unpolarized generalized parton distributions H and E?,"  We propose a physically motivated parametrization for the unpolarized
generalized parton distributions, H and E, valid at both zero and non-zero
values of the skewness variable, \zeta. Our approach follows a previous
detailed study of the \zeta=0 case where H and E were determined using
constraints from simultaneous fits of the experimental data on both the nucleon
elastic form factors and the deep inelastic structure functions in the non
singlet sector. Additional constraints at \zeta \neq 0 are provided by lattice
calculations of the higher moments of generalized parton distributions. We
illustrate a method for extracting generalized parton distributions from
lattice moments based on a reconstruction using sets of orthogonal polynomials.
The inclusion in our fit of data on Deeply Virtual Compton Scattering is also
discussed. Our method provides a step towards a model independent extraction of
generalized distributions from the data. It also provides an alternative to
double distributions based phenomenological models in that we are able to
satisfy the polynomiality condition by construction, using a combination of
experimental data and lattice, without resorting to any specific mathematical
construct.
"
What are the qualitative differences in rotating stars due to General Relativity effects?,"  We investigate the General Relativistic (GR) effects on the conversion from
nuclear to two-flavour quark matter in compact stars, both static as well as
rotating. We find that GR effects lead to qualitative differences in rotating
stars, indicating the inadequacy of non-relativistic (NR) or even Special
Relativistic (SR) treatments for these cases.
"
What is the density dependence of symmetry energy at sub-saturation densities in the Lagrangian models?,"  Using in-medium hadron properties according to the Brown-Rho scaling due to
the chiral symmetry restoration at high densities and considering naturalness
of the coupling constants, we have newly constructed several relativistic
mean-field Lagrangians with chiral limits. The model parameters are adjusted
such that the symmetric part of the resulting equation of state at supra-normal
densities is consistent with that required by the collective flow data from
high energy heavy-ion reactions, while the resulting density dependence of the
symmetry energy at sub-saturation densities agrees with that extracted from the
recent isospin diffusion data from intermediate energy heavy-ion reactions. The
resulting equations of state have the special feature of being soft at
intermediate densities but stiff at high densities naturally. With these
constrained equations of state, it is found that the radius of a 1.4$M_\odot$
canonical neutron star is in the range of 11.9 km$\leq$R$\leq$13.1 km, and the
maximum neutron star mass is around 2.0$M_\odot$ close to the recent
observations.
"
What is the lower bound on the decay branching ratio for the process pi0 -> e+e-?,"  Within the dispersive approach to the amplitude of the rare decay pi0 -> e+e-
the nontrivial dynamics is contained only in the subtraction constant. We
express this constant, in the leading order in (m_e/\Lambda)^2 perturbative
series, in terms of the inverse moment of the pion transition form factor given
in symmetric kinematics. By using the CELLO and CLEO data on the pion
transition form factor given in asymmetric kinematics the lower bound on the
decay branching ratio is found. The restrictions following from QCD allow us to
make a quantitative prediction for the branching B(pi0 -> e+e-) =(6.2\pm
0.1)*10^{-8} which is 3\sigma below the recent KTeV measurement. We confirm our
prediction by using the quark models and phenomenological approaches based on
the vector meson dominance. The decays \eta -> l^+l^- are also discussed.
"
What is the theoretical analysis of impact ionization fronts in reversely biased p^{+}-n-n^{+} structures?,"  We present an analytical theory for impact ionization fronts in reversely
biased p^{+}-n-n^{+} structures. The front propagates into a depleted n base
with a velocity that exceeds the saturated drift velocity. The front passage
generates a dense electron-hole plasma and in this way switches the structure
from low to high conductivity. For a planar front we determine the
concentration of the generated plasma, the maximum electric field, the front
width and the voltage over the n base as functions of front velocity and doping
of the n base. Theory takes into account that drift velocities and impact
ionization coefficients differ between electrons and holes, and it makes
quantitative predictions for any semiconductor material possible.
"
What are the results of the two-phonon amplitude measurement?,"  We study phonons in a dynamical chain of ions confined by a trap with a
time-dependent (axial) potential strength and demonstrate that they behave in
the same way as quantum fields in an expanding/contracting universe. Based on
this analogy, we present a scheme for the detection of the analogue of
cosmological particle creation which should be feasible with present-day
technology. In order to test the quantum nature of the particle creation
mechanism and to distinguish it from classical effects such as heating, we
propose to measure the two-phonon amplitude via the $2^{\rm nd}$ red side-band
and to compare it with the one-phonon amplitude ($1^{\rm st}$ red side-band).

"
What are the implications of the fluctuations in the number of clusters for the clustering of color sources?,"  We present our results on multiplicity and $p_T$ fluctuations at LHC energies
in the framework of the clustering of color sources. In this approach,
elementary color sources -strings- overlap forming clusters, so the number of
effective sources is modified. We find that the fluctuations are proportional
to the number of those clusters.
"
What is the relationship between the mapping torus and the automorphism of a free group?,"  We prove that the mapping torus group $\FN \rtimes_{\alpha} \Z$ of any
automorphism $\alpha$ of a free group $\FN$ of finite rank $n \geq 2$ is weakly
hyperbolic relative to the canonical (up to conjugation) family $\mathcal
H(\alpha)$ of subgroups of $\FN$ which consists of (and contains
representatives of all) conjugacy classes that grow polynomially under
iteration of $\alpha$. Furthermore, we show that $\FN \rtimes_{\alpha} \Z$ is
strongly hyperbolic relative to the mapping torus of the family $\mathcal
H(\alpha)$. As an application, we use a result of Drutu-Sapir to deduce that
$\FN \rtimes_{\alpha} \Z$ has Rapic Decay.

"What is the evidence of interaction between the lobes of W50 and the interstellar medium, and what are the implications of this interaction?","  [ABRIDGED] The distance to the relativistic jet source SS433 and the related
supernova remnant W50 is re-examined using new observations of HI in absorption
from the VLA, HI in emission from the GBT, and 12CO emission from the FCRAO.
The new measurements show HI in absorption against SS433 to a velocity of 75
km/s but not to the velocity of the tangent point, which bounds the kinematic
distance at 5.5 < d_k < 6.5 kpc. This is entirely consistent with a 5.5 +/- 0.2
kpc distance determined from light travel-time arguments (Blundell & Bowler
2004). The HI emission map shows evidence of interaction of the lobes of W50
with the interstellar medium near the adopted systemic velocity of V_LSR = 75
km/s. The western lobe sits in a cavity in the HI emission near the Galactic
plane, while the eastern lobe terminates at an expanding HI shell. The
expanding shell has a radius of 40 pc, contains 8 +/- 3 x 10^3 M_sun of HI and
has a measured kinetic energy of 3 +/- 1.5 x 10^{49} ergs. There may also be a
static HI ring or shell around the main part of W50 itself at an LSR velocity
of 75 km/s, with a radius of 70 pc and a mass in HI of 3.5 - 10 x 10^4 M_sun.
We do not find convincing evidence for the interaction of the system with any
molecular cloud or with HI at other velocities. The HI emission data suggest
that SS433 lies in an interstellar environment substantially denser than
average for its distance from the Galactic plane. This Population I system, now
about 200 pc below the Galactic plane, most likely originated as a runaway
O-star binary ejected from a young cluster in the plane. New astrometric data
on SS433 show that the system now has a peculiar velocity of a few tens of km/s
in the direction of the Galactic plane. From this peculiar velocity and the
symmetry of the W50 remnant we derive a time since the SN of < 10^5 yr.

What are the values of the parameters $\lambda_h$ and $\tau'$ in the scaling function for the number of hulls per unit area?,"  We study the distribution of domain areas, areas enclosed by domain
boundaries (''hulls''), and perimeters for curvature-driven two-dimensional
coarsening, employing a combination of exact analysis and numerical studies,
for various initial conditions. We show that the number of hulls per unit area,
$n_h(A,t) dA$, with enclosed area in the interval $(A,A+dA)$, is described, for
a disordered initial condition, by the scaling function $n_h(A,t) = 2c_h/(A +
\lambda_h t)^2$, where $c_h=1/8\pi\sqrt{3} \approx 0.023$ is a universal
constant and $\lambda_h$ is a material parameter. For a critical initial
condition, the same form is obtained, with the same $\lambda_h$ but with $c_h$
replaced by $c_h/2$. For the distribution of domain areas, we argue that the
corresponding scaling function has, for random initial conditions, the form
$n_d(A,t) = 2c_d (\lambda_d t)^{\tau'-2}/(A + \lambda_d t)^{\tau'}$, where
$c_d=c_h + {\cal O}(c_h^2)$, $\lambda_d=\lambda_h + {\cal O}(c_h)$, and $\tau'
= 187/91 \approx 2.055$. For critical initial conditions, one replaces $c_d$ by
$c_d/2$ (possibly with corrections of ${\cal O}(c_h^2)$) and the exponent is
$\tau = 379/187 \approx 2.027$. These results are extended to describe the
number density of the length of hulls and domain walls surrounding connected
clusters of aligned spins. These predictions are supported by extensive
numerical simulations. We also study numerically the geometric properties of
the boundaries and areas.
"
What are the restrictions on the parameters of the Fokker-Planck equation?,"  A recently introduced nonlinear Fokker-Planck equation, derived directly from
a master equation, comes out as a very general tool to describe
phenomenologically systems presenting complex behavior, like anomalous
diffusion, in the presence of external forces. Such an equation is
characterized by a nonlinear diffusion term that may present, in general, two
distinct powers of the probability distribution. Herein, we calculate the
stationary-state distributions of this equation in some special cases, and
introduce associated classes of generalized entropies in order to satisfy the
H-theorem. Within this approach, the parameters associated with the transition
rates of the original master-equation are related to such generalized
entropies, and are shown to obey some restrictions. Some particular cases are
discussed.
"
How does the Richardson-Lucy algorithm contribute to the image restoration technique for GLAST-LAT and EGRET observations?,"  We describe the role of GeV gamma-ray observations with GLAST-LAT (Gamma-ray
Large Area Space Telescope - Large Area Telescope) in identifying interaction
sites of cosmic-ray proton (or hadrons) with interstellar medium (ISM). We
expect to detect gamma rays from neutral pion decays in high-density ISM
regions in the Galaxy, Large Magellanic Cloud, and other satellite galaxies.
These gamma-ray sources have been detected already with EGRET (Energetic Gamma
Ray Experiment Telescope) as extended sources (eg. LMC and Orion clouds) and
GLAST-LAT will detect many more with a higher spatial resolution and in a wider
spectral range. We have developed a novel image restoration technique based on
the Richardson-Lucy algorithm optimized for GLAST-LAT observation of extended
sources. Our algorithm calculates PSF (point spread function) for each event.
This step is very important for GLAST-LAT and EGRET image analysis since PSF
varies more than one order of magnitude from one gamma ray to another depending
on its energy as well as its impact point and angle in the instrument. The
GLAST-LAT and EGRET image analysis has to cope with Poisson fluctuation due to
low number of detected photons for most sources. Our technique incorporates
wavelet filtering to minimize effects due to the fluctuation. Preliminary
studies on some EGRET sources are presented, which shows potential of this
novel image restoration technique for the identification and characterisation
of extended gamma-ray sources.
"
What are the properties of the radio-dim submillimeter galaxies that distinguish them from radio-bright sources?,"  We have used the Submillimeter Array to image a flux limited sample of seven
submillimeter galaxies, selected by the AzTEC camera on the JCMT at 1.1 mm, in
the COSMOS field at 890um with 2"" resolution. All of the sources - two
radio-bright and five radio-dim - are detected as single point-sources at high
significance (> 6\sigma), with positions accurate to 0.2"" that enable
counterpart identification at other wavelengths observed with similarly high
angular resolution. All seven have IRAC counterparts, but only two have secure
counterparts in deep HST/ACS imaging. As compared to the two radio-bright
sources in the sample, and those in previous studies, the five radio-dim
sources in the sample (1) have systematically higher submillimeter-to-radio
flux ratios, (2) have lower IRAC 3.6-8.0um fluxes, and (3) are not detected at
24um. These properties, combined with size constraints at 890um (\theta <
1.2""), suggest that the radio-dim submillimeter galaxies represent a population
of very dusty starbursts, with physical scales similar to local ultraluminous
infrared galaxies, and an average redshift higher than radio-bright sources.
"
What is the regulator map for the extended Bloch group?,"  There are two infinitesimal (i.e., additive) versions of the $K$-theory of a
field $F$: one was introduced by Cathelineau, which is an $F$-module, and
another one introduced by Bloch-Esnault, which is an $F^*$-module. Both
versions are equipped with a regulator map, when $F$ is the field of complex
numbers.
  In our short paper we will introduce an extended version of Cathelineau's
group, and a complex-valued regulator map given by the entropy. We will also
give a comparison map between our extended version and Cathelineau's group.
  Our results were motivated by two unrelated sources: Neumann's work on the
extended Bloch group (which is isomorphic to indecomposable $K_3$ of the
complex numbers), and the study of singularities of generating series of
hypergeometric multisums. Final version.
"
What are the key concepts of supplementing algebraic considerations with a proper treatment of boundary conditions?,"  An exactly solvable position-dependent mass Schr\""odinger equation in two
dimensions, depicting a particle moving in a semi-infinite layer, is
re-examined in the light of recent theories describing superintegrable
two-dimensional systems with integrals of motion that are quadratic functions
of the momenta. To get the energy spectrum a quadratic algebra approach is used
together with a realization in terms of deformed parafermionic oscillator
operators. In this process, the importance of supplementing algebraic
considerations with a proper treatment of boundary conditions for selecting
physical wavefunctions is stressed. Some new results for matrix elements are
derived. This example emphasizes the interest of a quadratic algebra approach
to position-dependent mass Schr\""odinger equations.
"
What is the mass of the Higgs boson in the CMSSM?,"  Measurements at low energies provide interesting indirect information about
masses of particles that are (so far) too heavy to be produced directly.
Motivated by recent progress in consistently and rigorously calculating
electroweak precision observables and flavour related observables, we derive
the preferred value for m_h in the Constrained Minimal Supersymmetric Standard
Model (CMSSM), obtained from a fit taking into account electroweak precision
data, flavour physics observables and the abundance of Cold Dark Matter. No
restriction is imposed on m_h itself: the experimental bound from direct Higgs
boson search at LEP is not included in the fit. A multi-parameter chi^2 is
minimized with respect to the free parameters of the CMSSM, M_0, M_1/2, A_0,
tan(beta). A statistical comparison with the Standard Model fit to the
electroweak precision data is made. The preferred value for the lightest Higgs
boson mass in the CMSSM is found to be m_h^CMSSM = 110+8-10(exp.)+-3(theo.)
GeV/c^2, where the first uncertainty is experimental and the second uncertainty
is theoretical. This value is in agreement with the limit from direct Higgs
boson search at LEP.
"
What are the fundamental properties of a martingale with quadratic growth?,"  In this paper we extend the notion of ``filtration-consistent nonlinear
expectation"" (or ""${\cal F}$-consistent nonlinear expectation"") to the case
when it is allowed to be dominated by a $g$-expectation that may have a
quadratic growth. We show that for such a nonlinear expectation many
fundamental properties of a martingale can still make sense, including the
Doob-Meyer type decomposition theorem and the optional sampling theorem. More
importantly, we show that any quadratic ${\cal F}$-consistent nonlinear
expectation with a certain domination property must be a quadratic
$g$-expectation. The main contribution of this paper is the finding of the
domination condition to replace the one used in all the previous works, which
is no longer valid in the quadratic case. We also show that the representation
generator must be deterministic, continuous, and actually must be of the simple
form.
"
How do the escape fractions of ionizing photons from galaxies vary along different lines-of-sight?,"  We model the escape of ionizing radiation from high-redshift galaxies using
high-resolution Adaptive Mesh Refinement N-body + hydrodynamics simulations.
Our simulations include time-dependent and spatially-resolved transfer of
ionizing radiation in three dimensions, including effects of dust absorption.
For galaxies of total mass M > 10^11 Msun and star formation rates SFR ~ 1-5
Msun/yr, we find angular averaged escape fractions of 0.01-0.03 over the entire
redshift interval studied (3<z<9). In addition, we find that the escape
fraction varies by more than an order of magnitude along different
lines-of-sight within individual galaxies, from the largest values near
galactic poles to the smallest along the galactic disk. The escape fraction
declines steeply at lower masses and SFR. We show that the low values of escape
fractions are due to a small fraction of young stars located just outside the
edge of HI disk. We compare our predicted escape fraction of ionizing photons
with previous results, and find a general agreement with both other simulation
results and available direct detection measurements at z ~ 3. We also compare
our simulations with a novel method to estimate the escape fraction in galaxies
from the observed distribution of neutral hydrogen column densities along the
lines of sights to long duration gamma-ray bursts. Using this method we find
escape fractions of the GRB host galaxies of 2-3%, consistent with our
theoretical predictions. [abridged]
"
What are the observed spectral features in the polar ring galaxy AM1934-563?,"  We report long-slit spectroscopic observations of the dust-lane polar-ring
galaxy AM1934-563 obtained with the Southern African Large Telescope (SALT)
during its performance-verification phase. The observations target the spectral
region of the Ha, [NII] and [SII] emission-lines, but show also deep NaI
stellar absorption lines that we interpret as produced by stars in the galaxy.
We derive rotation curves along the major axis of the galaxy that extend out to
about 8 kpc from the center for both the gaseous and the stellar components,
using the emission and absorption lines. We derive similar rotation curves
along the major axis of the polar ring and point out differences between these
and the ones of the main galaxy. We identify a small diffuse object visible
only in Ha emission and with a low velocity dispersion as a dwarf HII galaxy
and argue that it is probably metal-poor. Its velocity indicates that it is a
fourth member of the galaxy group in which AM1934-563 belongs. We discuss the
observations in the context of the proposal that the object is the result of a
major merger and point out some observational discrepancies from this
explanation. We argue that an alternative scenario that could better fit the
observations may be the slow accretion of cold intergalactic gas, focused by a
dense filament of galaxies in which this object is embedded (abridged).
"
What are the implications of the temperature variation damping on the band gap spectroscopy?,"  Remarkably big increase of the substrate temperature during the
low-temperature MBE growth of GaMnAs layers is observed by means of band gap
spectroscopy. It is explained and simulated in terms of changes in the
absorption/emission characteristics of the growing layer. Options for the
temperature variation damping are discussed.
"
What is the role of gas in the mergers of galaxies with HI in their immediate environs?,"  The focus of current research in galaxy evolution has increasingly turned to
understanding the effect that mergers have on the evolution of systems on the
red sequence. For those interactions purported to occur dissipationlessly (so
called ""dry mergers""), it would appear that the role of gas is minimal.
However, if these mergers are not completely dry, then even low levels of gas
may be detectable. The purpose of our study is to test whether early type
galaxies with HI in or around them, or ""wet"" ellipticals, would have been
selected as dry mergers by the criteria in van Dokkum (2005, AJ, 130, 2647). To
that end, we examine a sample of 20 early types from the HI Rogues Gallery with
neutral hydrogen in their immediate environs. Of these, the 15 brightest and
reddest galaxies match the optical dry merger criteria, but in each case, the
presence of HI means that they are not truly dry.
"
What is the quark model used to calculate the longitudinal and transverse spin densities of quarks in the nucleon?,"  The first moment of longitudinal and transverse spin densities of quarks in
the nucleon are calculated in a light-front constituent quark model for the
different cases of quark and nucleon polarization. Significant distortions are
found for the transverse spin densities. In particular the Sivers function is
predicted with opposite sign for up and down quarks and the Boer-Mulders
function is predicted large and negative for both up and down quarks, in
agreement with lattice calculations. Quite a different spin distribution is
obtained for up and down quarks in the cases of quarks and proton transversely
or longitudinally polarized in the same direction.
"
What are the subband compressibilities in the metallic phase of LaTiO_3?,"  The insulator to metal transition in LaTiO_3 induced by La substitution via
Sr is studied within multi-band exact diagonalization dynamical mean field
theory at finite temperatures. It is shown that weak hole doping triggers a
large interorbital charge transfer, with simultaneous electron and hole doping
of t2g subbands. The transition is first-order and exhibits phase separation
between insulator and metal. In the metallic phase, subband compressibilities
become very large and have opposite signs. Electron doping gives rise to an
interorbital charge flow in the same direction as hole doping. These results
can be understood in terms of a strong orbital depolarization.
"
What is the critical behavior of magnetic thin films as a function of the film thickness?,"  We study the critical behavior of magnetic thin films as a function of the
film thickness. We use the ferromagnetic Ising model with the high-resolution
multiple histogram Monte Carlo (MC) simulation. We show that though the 2D
behavior remains dominant at small thicknesses, there is a systematic
continuous deviation of the critical exponents from their 2D values. We observe
that in the same range of varying thickness the deviation of the exponent $\nu$
is very small from its 2D value, while exponent $\beta$ suffers a larger
deviation. Moreover, as long as the film thickness is fixed, i. e. no finite
size scaling is done in the $z$ direction perpendicular to the film, the 3D
values of the critical exponents cannot be attained even with very large (but
fixed) thickness. The crossover to 3D universality class cannot therefore take
place without finite size scaling applied in the $z$ direction, in the limit of
numerically accessible thicknesses. From values of exponent $\alpha$ obtained
by MC, we estimate the effective dimension of the system. We conclude that with
regard to the critical behavior, thin films behave as systems with effective
dimension between 2 and 3.
"
What is the metric coefficients used to obtain non-static solutions around a global monopole?,"  A class of non static solutions around a global monopole resulting from the
breaking of a global S0(3) symmetry based on Lyra geometry are obtained. The
solutions are obtained using the functional separability of the metric
coefficients. We have shown that the monopole exerts attractive gravitational
effects on test particles.
"
What is the smooth fit principle?,"  We explicitly solve the optimal switching problem for one-dimensional
diffusions by directly employing the dynamic programming principle and the
excessive characterization of the value function. The shape of the value
function and the smooth fit principle then can be proved using the properties
of concave functions.
"
What are the implications of the gluon scattering amplitudes for gluon scattering in the context of AdS/CFT?,"  We demonstrate the applicability of the dressing method to the problem of
constructing new classical solutions for Euclidean worldsheets in anti-de
Sitter space. The motivation stems from recent work of Alday and Maldacena, who
studied gluon scattering amplitudes at strong coupling using a generalization
of a particular worldsheet found by Kruczenski whose edge traces a path
composed of light-light segments on the boundary of AdS. We dress this `giant
gluon' to find new solutions in AdS_3 and AdS_5 whose edges trace out more
complicated, timelike curves on the boundary. These solutions may be used to
calculate certain Wilson loops via AdS/CFT.
"
What is the Hamiltonian theory of the fractional quantum Hall effect?,"  The Hamiltonian Theory of the fractional quantum Hall effect is an operator
description that subsumes many properties of Composite Fermions, applies to
gapped and gapless cases, and has been found to provide results in quantitative
accord with data on gaps, relaxation rates and polarizations at temperatures of
$300mK$ and above. The only free parameter is $\lambda$, which is related to
the sample thickness and appears in the Zhang-Das Sarma potential $v(q) = {2\pi
e^2\over \kappa q} e^{-ql\lambda}$ where $l$ and $\kappa $ are the magnetic
length and dielectric constant. Here we examine the recent data of Tracy and
Eisenstein on the nuclear magnetic resonance relaxation rate at filling factor
$\nu=\half$ deduced from resistivity measurements at temperatures as low as
$45mK$. We find that their results can be satisfactorily described by this
theory, if in addition to a $v(q)$ with $\lambda \simeq 2$, a constant disorder
width $\Gamma\simeq 100 mK$ is incorporated.
"
What are the key concepts in the Hamilton-Jacobi theory of orthogonal separation of variables?,"  The interplay between the Hamilton-Jacobi theory of orthogonal separation of
variables and the theory of group actions is investigated based on concrete
examples.
"
What is the influence of the relativistic covariance requirement on the optimality of the symmetric state-dependent 1 -> 2 cloning machine?,"  The influence of the relativistic covariance requirement on the optimality of
the symmetric state-dependent 1 -> 2 cloning machine is studied. Namely, given
a photonic qubit whose basis is formed from the momentum-helicity eigenstates,
the change to the optimal cloning fidelity is calculated taking into account
the Lorentz covariance unitarily represented by Wigner's little group. To
pinpoint some of the interesting results, we found states for which the optimal
fidelity of the cloning process drops to 2/3 which corresponds to the fidelity
of the optimal classical cloner. Also, an implication for the security of the
BB84 protocol is analyzed.
"
What are the key features of the algorithm?,"  We introduce an optimization algorithm for resource allocation in the LIPI
Public Cluster to optimize its usage according to incoming requests from users.
The tool is an extended and modified genetic algorithm developed to match
specific natures of public cluster. We present a detail analysis of
optimization, and compare the results with the exact calculation. We show that
it would be very useful and could realize an automatic decision making system
for public clusters.
"
What is the generalized fluctuation-dissipation relation for a Brownian motor?,"  A Brownian Motor is a nanoscale or molecular device that combines the effects
of thermal noise, spatial or temporal asymmetry, and directionless input energy
to drive directed motion. Because of the input energy, Brownian motors function
away from thermodynamic equilibrium and concepts such as linear response
theory, fluctuation dissipation relations, and detailed balance do not apply.
The {\em generalized} fluctuation-dissipation relation, however, states that
even under strongly thermodynamically non-equilibrium conditions the ratio of
the probability of a transition to the probability of the time-reverse of that
transition is the exponent of the change in the internal energy of the system
due to the transition. Here, we derive an extension of the generalized
fluctuation dissipation theorem for a Brownian motor for the ratio between the
probability for the motor to take a forward step and the probability to take a
backward step.
"
What are the universal amplitude ratios in the 4-state Potts model?,"  Monte Carlo (MC) and series expansion (SE) data for the energy, specific
heat, magnetization and susceptibility of the two-dimensional 4-state Potts
model in the vicinity of the critical point are analysed. The role of
logarithmic corrections is discussed and an approach is proposed in order to
account numerically for these corrections in the determination of critical
amplitudes. Accurate estimates of universal amplitude ratios $A_+/A_-$,
$\Gamma_+/\Gamma_-$, $\Gamma_T/\Gamma_-$ and $R_C^\pm$ are given, which arouse
new questions with respect to previous works.
"
What is the relationship between the phase model and the Ginzburg-Landau equation?,"  We demonstrate that a system of nonlocally coupled noisy phase oscillators
can collectively exhibit a hole structure, which manifests itself in the
spatial phase distribution of the oscillators. The phase model is described by
a nonlinear Fokker-Planck equation, which can be reduced to the complex
Ginzburg-Landau equation near the Hopf bifurcation point of the uniform
solution. By numerical simulations, we show that the hole structure clearly
appears in the space-dependent order parameter, which corresponds to the
Nozaki-Bekki hole solution of the complex Ginzburg-Landau equation.
"
What are the thermal width and effective dissociation cross section of the J/psi and upsilon quarkonium at 1.4 Tc?,"  Recent lattice calculations showed that the quarkonia will survive beyond the
phase transition temperature, and will dissolve at different temperatures
depending on the type of the quarkonium. In this work, we calculate the thermal
width of the quarkonium at finite temperature before it dissolves into open
heavy quarks. The input of the calculation are the parton quarkonium
dissociation cross section to NLO in QCD, the quarkonium wave function in a
temperature-dependent potential from lattice QCD, and a thermal distribution of
partons with thermal masses. We find that for the J/psi, the total thermal
width above 1.4 Tc becomes larger than 100 to 250 MeV, depending on the
effective thermal masses of the quark and gluon, which we take between 400 to
600 MeV. Such a width corresponds to an effective dissociation cross section by
gluons between 1.5 to 3.5 mb and by quarks 1 to 2 mb at 1.4 Tc. However, at
similar temperatures, we find a much smaller thermal width and effective cross
section for the upsilon.
"
What is the amplitude of the brightest giant pulse detected by the MWA-LFD system?,"  We report on the detection of giant pulses from the Crab Nebula pulsar at a
frequency of 200 MHz using the field deployment system designed for the Mileura
Widefield Array's Low Frequency Demonstrator (MWA-LFD). Our observations are
among the first high-quality detections at such low frequencies. The measured
pulse shapes are deconvolved for interstellar pulse broadening, yielding a
pulse-broadening time of 670$\pm$100 $\mu$s, and the implied strength of
scattering (scattering measure) is the lowest that is estimated towards the
Crab nebula from observations made so far. The sensitivity of the system is
largely dictated by the sky background, and our simple equipment is capable of
detecting pulses that are brighter than $\sim$9 kJy in amplitude. The brightest
giant pulse detected in our data has a peak amplitude of $\sim$50 kJy, and the
implied brightness temperature is $10^{31.6}$ K. We discuss the giant pulse
detection prospects with the full MWA-LFD system. With a sensitivity over two
orders of magnitude larger than the prototype equipment, the full system will
be capable of detecting such bright giant pulses out to a wide range of
Galactic distances; from $\sim$8 to $\sim$30 kpc depending on the frequency.
The MWA-LFD will thus be a highly promising instrument for the studies of giant
pulses and other fast radio transients at low frequencies.
"
What are the A-hypergeometric systems and Horn hypergeometric systems?,"  We show that A-hypergeometric systems and Horn hypergeometric systems are
Weyl closed for very generic parameters.
"
What are the quantum logic representations of macroscopic systems?,"  The aim of this paper is to apply a contextual probabilistic model (in the
spirit of Mackey, Gudder, Ballentine) to represent and to generalize some
results of quantum logic about possible macroscopic quantum-like (QL)
behaviour. The crucial point is that our model provides QL-representation of
macroscopic configurations in terms of complex probability amplitudes -- wave
functions of such configurations. Thus, instead of the language of propositions
which is common in quatum logic, we use the language of wave functions which is
common in the conventional presentation of QM. We propose a quantum-like
representation algorithm, QLRA, which maps probabilistic data of any origin in
complex (or even hyperbolic) Hilbert space. On the one hand, this paper
clarifyes some questions in foundations of QM, since some rather mystical
quantum features are illustrated on the basis of behavior of macroscopic
systems. On the other hand, the approach developed in this paper may be used
e.g. in biology, sociology, or psychology. Our example of QL-representation of
hidden macroscopic configurations can find natural applications in those
domains of science.
"
What are the higher-spin gauge field triplets interacting with massive free scalars in flat space?,"  We apply a recently presented BRST procedure to construct the Largangian
cubic vertex of higher-spin gauge field triplets interacting with massive free
scalars. In flat space, the spin-s triplet propagates the series of irreducible
spin-s, s-2,..,0/1 modes which couple independently to corresponding conserved
currents constructed from the scalars. The simple covariantization of the flat
space result is not enough in AdS, as new interaction vertices appear. We
present in detail the cases of spin-2 and spin-3 triplets coupled to scalars.
Restricting to a single irreducible spin-s mode we uncover previously obtained
results. We also present an alternative derivation of the lower spin results
based on the idea that higher-spin gauge fields arise from the gauging of
higher derivative symmetries of free matter Lagrangians. Our results can be
readily applied to holographic studies of higher-spin gauge theories.
"
"What is the spectrum of the Seyfert 2 galaxy NGC 2992, and what are its implications?","  The Seyfert 2 galaxies NGC 2992 and NGC 3081 have been observed by INTEGRAL
and Swift. We report about the results and the comparison of the spectrum above
10 keV based on INTEGRAL IBIS/ISGRI, Swift/BAT, and BeppoSAX/PDS. A spectrum
can be extracted in the X-ray energy band ranging from 1 keV up to 200 keV.
Although NGC 2992 shows a complex spectrum below 10 keV, the hard tail observed
by various missions exhibits a slope with photon index = 2, independent on the
flux level during the observation. No cut-off is detectable up to the detection
limit around 200 keV. In addition, NGC 3081 is detected in the INTEGRAL and
Swift observation and also shows an unbroken Gamma = 1.8 spectrum up to 150
keV. These two Seyfert galaxies give further evidence that a high-energy
cut-off in the hard X-ray spectra is often located at energies E_C >> 100 keV.
In NGC 2992 a constant spectral shape is observed over a hard X-ray luminosity
variation by a factor of 11. This might indicate that the physical conditions
of the emitting hot plasma are constant, while the amount of plasma varies, due
to long-term flaring activity.
"
What is the age of the stellar population in the intermediate-age star cluster BS 90?,"  We present the results of our investigation of the intermediate-age star
cluster BS 90, located in the vicinity of the HII region N 66 in the SMC,
observed with HST/ACS. The high-resolution data provide a unique opportunity
for a very detailed photometric study performed on one of the rare
intermediate-age rich SMC clusters. The complete set of observations is
centered on the association NGC 346 and contains almost 100,000 stars down to V
~28 mag. In this study we focus on the northern part of the region, which
covers almost the whole stellar content of BS 90. We construct its stellar
surface density profile and derive structural parameters. Isochrone fits on the
CMD of the cluster results in an age of about 4.5 Gyr. The luminosity function
is constructed and the present-day mass function of BS 90 has been obtained
using the mass-luminosity relation, derived from the isochrone models. We found
a slope between -1.30 and -0.95, comparable or somewhat shallower than a
typical Salpeter IMF. Examination of the radial dependence of the mass function
shows a steeper slope at larger radial distances, indicating mass segregation
in the cluster. The derived half-mass relaxation time of 0.95 Gyr suggests that
the cluster is mass segregated due to its dynamical evolution. From the
isochrone model fits we derive a metallicity for BS 90 of [Fe/H]=-0.72, which
adds an important point to the age-metallicity relation of the SMC. We discuss
our findings on this relation in comparison to other SMC clusters.
"
What is the efficiency of the energy deposition process in a rotating star?,"  We have studied the $\nu + \bar{\nu} \to e^+ + e^- $ energy deposition rate
in a rotating compact star. This reaction is important for the study of gamma
ray bursts. The General Relativistic (GR) effects on the energy deposition rate
have been incorporated. We find that the efficiency of the process is larger
for a rotating star. The total energy deposition rate increases by more than an
order of magnitude due to rotation. The dependence of this energy deposition
rate on the deformation parameter of the star has also been discussed.
"
What is the quantum scalar constraint with negative cosmological constant in the FRW model?,"  Open FRW model in Loop Quantum Cosmology is under consideration. The left and
right invariant vector fields and holonomies along them are studied. It is
shown that in the hyperbolic geometry of $k=-1$ it is possible to construct a
suitable loop which provides us with quantum scalar constraint originally
introduced by Vandersloot. The quantum scalar constraint operator with negative
cosmological constant is proved to be essentially self-adjoint.
"
What is the magnetically ordered ground state of CeRhIn$_{5}$ at ambient pressure and zero magnetic field?,"  The magnetically ordered ground state of CeRhIn$_{5}$ at ambient pressure and
zero magnetic field is an incomensurate helicoidal phase with the propagation
vector $\bf{k}$=(1/2, 1/2, 0.298) and the magnetic moment in the basal plane of
the tetragonal structure. We determined by neutron diffraction the two
different magnetically ordered phases of CeRhIn$_{5}$ evidenced by bulk
measurements under applied magnetic field in its basal plane. The low
temperature high magnetic phase corresponds to a sine-wave structure of the
magnetization being commensurate with $\bf{k}$=(1/2, 1/2, 1/4). At high
temperature, the phase is incommensurate with $\bf{k}$=(1/2, 1/2, 0.298) and a
possible small ellipticity. The propagation vector of this phase is the same as
the one of the zero-field structure.
"
What are the algorithms for computing approximate matrix products using sparse representations?,"  Thus far, sparse representations have been exploited largely in the context
of robustly estimating functions in a noisy environment from a few
measurements. In this context, the existence of a basis in which the signal
class under consideration is sparse is used to decrease the number of necessary
measurements while controlling the approximation error. In this paper, we
instead focus on applications in numerical analysis, by way of sparse
representations of linear operators with the objective of minimizing the number
of operations needed to perform basic operations (here, multiplication) on
these operators. We represent a linear operator by a sum of rank-one operators,
and show how a sparse representation that guarantees a low approximation error
for the product can be obtained from analyzing an induced quadratic form. This
construction in turn yields new algorithms for computing approximate matrix
products.
"
What are the leading mechanisms of the genetic code evolution?,"  Part 1 of the study intends to show that the universal trend of amino acid
gain and loss discovered by Jordan et al. (2005) can be accounted for by the
spontaneity of DNA typical damages. These damages lead to replacements of
guanine and cytosine by thymine. Part 2 proposes a hypothesis of the evolution
of the genetic code, the leading mechanism of which is the nucleotide
spontaneous damage. The hypothesis accounts for the universal trend of amino
acid gain and loss, stability of the genetic code towards point mutations, the
presence of code dialects, and the symmetry of the genetic code table.

"What are the advantages and limitations of using multidimensional scaling, semantic differential method, and preference mapping for the subjective assessment of virtual products?","  User's perception of product, by essence subjective, is a major topic in
marketing and industrial design. Many methods, based on users' tests, are used
so as to characterise this perception. We are interested in three main methods:
multidimensional scaling, semantic differential method, and preference mapping.
These methods are used to built a perceptual space, in order to position the
new product, to specify requirements by the study of user's preferences, to
evaluate some product attributes, related in particular to style (aesthetic).
These early stages of the design are primordial for a good orientation of the
project. In parallel, virtual reality tools and interfaces are more and more
efficient for suggesting to the user complex feelings, and creating in this way
various levels of perceptions. In this article, we present on an example the
use of multidimensional scaling, semantic differential method and preference
mapping for the subjective assessment of virtual products. These products,
which geometrical form is variable, are defined with a CAD model and are
proposed to the user with a spacemouse and stereoscopic glasses. Advantages and
limitations of such evaluation is next discussed..

What are the correlation functions for the massless XXZ chain derived by Jimbo and Miwa?,"  We have analytically obtained all the density matrix elements up to six
lattice sites for the spin-1/2 Heisenberg XXZ chain at $\Delta=1/2$. We use the
multiple integral formula of the correlation function for the massless XXZ
chain derived by Jimbo and Miwa. As for the spin-spin correlation functions, we
have newly obtained the fourth- and fifth-neighbour transverse correlation
functions. We have calculated all the eigenvalues of the density matrix and
analyze the eigenvalue-distribution. Using these results the exact values of
the entanglement entropy for the reduced density matrix up six lattice sites
have been obtained. We observe that our exact results agree quite well with the
asymptotic formula predicted by the conformal field theory.
"
What are the results of a model and an experiment on the diffusion of particles of different sizes through a membrane?,"  Past work has shown that ions can pass through a membrane more readily in one
direction than the other. We demonstrate here in a model and an experiment that
for a mixture of small and large particles such asymmetric diffusion can arise
solely from an asymmetry in the geometry of the pores of the membrane. Our
deterministic simulation considers a two-dimensional gas of elastic disks of
two sizes diffusing through a membrane, and our laboratory experiment examines
the diffusion of glass beads of two sizes through a metal membrane. In both
experiment and simulation, the membrane is permeable only to the smaller
particles, and the asymmetric pores lead to an asymmetry in the diffusion rates
of these particles. The presence of even a small percentage of large particles
can clog a membrane, preventing passage of the small particles in one direction
while permitting free flow of the small particles in the other direction. The
purely geometric kinetic constraints may play a role in common biological
contexts such as membrane ion channels.
"
What is the relationship between the concentration of LCDM halos and their mass?,"  We use the Millennium Simulation (MS) to study the statistics of LCDM halo
concentrations at z = 0. Our results confirm that the average halo
concentration declines monotonically with mass; a power-law fits well the
concentration-mass relation for over 3 decades in mass, up to the most massive
objects to form in a LCDM universe (~ 10^15 h^-1 Msol). This is in clear
disagreement with the predictions of the model proposed by Bullock et al. for
these rare objects, and agrees better with the original predictions of Navarro,
Frenk, & White. The large volume surveyed, together with the unprecedented
numerical resolution of the MS, allow us to estimate with confidence the
distribution of concentrations and, consequently, the abundance of systems with
unusual properties. About one in a hundred cluster haloes (M200 >~ 3x10^14 h^-1
Msol) have concentrations exceeding c200 = 7.5, a result that may be used to
interpret the likelihood of unusually strong massive gravitational lenses, such
as Abell 1689, in the LCDM cosmogony. A similar fraction (1 in 100) of
galaxy-sized haloes (M200 ~ 10^12 h^-1 Msol) have c200 < 4.5, an important
constraint on models that attempt to reconcile the rotation curves of low
surface-brightness galaxies by appealing to haloes of unexpectedly low
concentration. We find that halo concentrations are independent of spin once
haloes manifestly out of equilibrium are removed from the sample. Compared to
their relaxed brethren, the concentrations of out-of-equilibrium haloes tend to
be lower and to have more scatter, while their spins tend to be higher...

"
What is the neutrino flux at the Earth's surface due to neutralino annihilations in the Sun?,"  Neutralino annihilations in the Sun to weak boson and top quark pairs lead to
high-energy neutrinos that can be detected by the IceCube and KM3 experiments
in the search for neutralino dark matter. We calculate the neutrino signals
from real and virtual WW, ZZ, Zh, and $t \bar t$ production and decays,
accounting for the spin-dependences of the matrix elements, which can have
important influences on the neutrino energy spectra. We take into account
neutrino propagation including neutrino oscillations, matter-resonance,
absorption, and nu_tau regeneration effects in the Sun and evaluate the
neutrino flux at the Earth. We concentrate on the compelling Focus Point (FP)
region of the supergravity model that reproduces the observed dark matter relic
density. For the FP region, the lightest neutralino has a large bino-higgsino
mixture that leads to a high neutrino flux and the spin-dependent neutralino
capture rate in the Sun is enhanced by 10^3 over the spin-independent rate. For
the standard estimate of neutralino captures, the muon signal rates in IceCube
are identifiable over the atmospheric neutrino background for neutralino masses
above M_Z up to 400 GeV.
"
What are the generalizations of the VC dimension for the missing case?,"  Bounds on the risk play a crucial role in statistical learning theory. They
usually involve as capacity measure of the model studied the VC dimension or
one of its extensions. In classification, such ""VC dimensions"" exist for models
taking values in {0, 1}, {1,..., Q} and R. We introduce the generalizations
appropriate for the missing case, the one of models with values in R^Q. This
provides us with a new guaranteed risk for M-SVMs which appears superior to the
existing one.
"
What are the three classes of charge-transfer states generated by photoexcitation in dimerized Mott insulators?,"  We investigate the optical properties of one-dimensional (1D) dimerized Mott
insulators using the 1D dimerized extended Hubbard model. Numerical
calculations and a perturbative analysis from the decoupled-dimer limit clarify
that there are three relevant classes of charge-transfer (CT) states generated
by photoexcitation: interdimer CT unbound states, interdimer CT exciton states,
and intradimer CT exciton states. This classification is applied to
understanding the optical properties of an organic molecular material,
1,3,5-trithia-2,4,6-triazapentalenyl (TTTA), which is known for its
photoinduced transition from the dimerized spin-singlet phase to the regular
paramagnetic phase. We conclude that the lowest photoexcited state of TTTA is
the interdimer CT exciton state and the second lowest state is the intradimer
CT exciton state.

"What is the infinitesimal version of the K-theory of a field F, an F-module?","  There are two infinitesimal (i.e., additive) versions of the $K$-theory of a
field $F$: one was introduced by Cathelineau, which is an $F$-module, and
another one introduced by Bloch-Esnault, which is an $F^*$-module. Both
versions are equipped with a regulator map, when $F$ is the field of complex
numbers.
  In our short paper we will introduce an extended version of Cathelineau's
group, and a complex-valued regulator map given by the entropy. We will also
give a comparison map between our extended version and Cathelineau's group.
  Our results were motivated by two unrelated sources: Neumann's work on the
extended Bloch group (which is isomorphic to indecomposable $K_3$ of the
complex numbers), and the study of singularities of generating series of
hypergeometric multisums. Final version.
"
How do the perturbations with wavelength comparable to the layer's thickness affect the two dominant growing modes?,"  We study the linear theory of Kelvin-Helmholtz instability in a layer of ions
and neutrals with finite thickness. In the short wavelength limit the thickness
of the layer has a negligible effect on the growing modes. However,
perturbations with wavelength comparable to layer's thickness are significantly
affected by the thickness of the layer. We show that the thickness of the layer
has a stabilizing effect on the two dominant growing modes. Transition between
the modes not only depends on the magnetic strength, but also on the thickness
of the layer.
"
What is the Fermilab antiproton facility used to serve the world's needs?,"  Fermilab operates the world's most intense antiproton source, now exclusively
dedicated to serving the needs of the Tevatron Collider. The anticipated 2009
shutdown of the Tevatron presents the opportunity for a world-leading low- and
medium-energy antiproton program. We summarize the status of the Fermilab
antiproton facility and review physics topics for which a future experiment
could make the world's best measurements.
"
What are the implications of the moduli fields for the cosmological and astrophysical implications of Calabi-Yau IIB string compactifications?,"  We study the spectrum, couplings and cosmological and astrophysical
implications of the moduli fields for the class of Calabi-Yau IIB string
compactifications for which moduli stabilisation leads to an exponentially
large volume V ~ 10^{15} l_s^6 and an intermediate string scale m_s ~
10^{11}GeV, with TeV-scale observable supersymmetry breaking. All K\""ahler
moduli except for the overall volume are heavier than the susy breaking scale,
with m ~ ln(M_P/m_{3/2}) m_{3/2} ~ (\ln(M_P/m_{3/2}))^2 m_{susy} ~ 500 TeV and,
contrary to standard expectations, have matter couplings suppressed only by the
string scale rather than the Planck scale. These decay to matter early in the
history of the universe, with a reheat temperature T ~ 10^7 GeV, and are free
from the cosmological moduli problem (CMP). The heavy moduli have a branching
ratio to gravitino pairs of 10^{-30} and do not suffer from the gravitino
overproduction problem. The overall volume modulus is a distinctive feature of
these models and is an M_{planck}-coupled scalar of mass m ~ 1 MeV and subject
to the CMP. A period of thermal inflation can help relax this problem. This
field has a lifetime ~ 10^{24}s and can contribute to dark matter. It may be
detected through its decays to 2\gamma or e^+e^-. If accessible the e^+e^-
decay mode dominates, with Br(\chi \to 2 \gamma) suppressed by a factor
(ln(M_P/m_{3/2}))^2. We consider the potential for detection of this field
through different astrophysical sources and find that the observed gamma-ray
background constrains \Omega_{\chi} <~ 10^{-4}. The decays of this field may
generate the 511 keV emission line from the galactic centre observed by
INTEGRAL/SPI.
"
What is the geometric interpretation of the codebook used in the encoding and decoding process?,"  We present a novel technique for encoding and decoding constant weight binary
codes that uses a geometric interpretation of the codebook. Our technique is
based on embedding the codebook in a Euclidean space of dimension equal to the
weight of the code. The encoder and decoder mappings are then interpreted as a
bijection between a certain hyper-rectangle and a polytope in this Euclidean
space. An inductive dissection algorithm is developed for constructing such a
bijection. We prove that the algorithm is correct and then analyze its
complexity. The complexity depends on the weight of the code, rather than on
the block length as in other algorithms. This approach is advantageous when the
weight is smaller than the square root of the block length.
"
What are the observed radial velocities of the ionized gas and stellar velocities in the central region of M33?,"  We present measurements of the stellar and gaseous velocities in the central
5' of the Local Group spiral M33. The data were obtained with the ARC 3.5m
telescope. Blue and red spectra with resolutions from 2 to 4\AA covering the
principal gaseous emission and stellar absorption lines were obtained along the
major and minor axes and six other position angles. The observed radial
velocities of the ionized gas along the photometric major axis of M33 remain
flat at ~22 km s^{-1} all the way into the center, while the stellar velocities
show a gradual rise from zero to 22 km s^{-1} over that same region. The
central star cluster is at or very close to the dynamical center, with a
velocity that is in accordance with M33's systemic velocity to within our
uncertainties. Velocities on the minor axis are non-zero out to about 1' from
the center in both the stars and gas. Together with the major axis velocities,
they point at significant deviations from circular rotation. The most likely
explanation for the bulk of the velocity patterns are streaming motions along a
weak inner bar with a PA close to that of the minor axis, as suggested by
previously published IR photometric images. The presence of bar imprints in M33
implies that all major Local Group galaxies are barred. The non-circular
motions over the inner 200 pc make it difficult to constrain the shape of M33's
inner dark matter halo profile. If the non-circular motions we find in this
nearby Sc galaxy are present in other more distant late-type galaxies, they
might be difficult to recognize.
"
What are the implications of the phase diagram of the 2D J1-J1'-J2 spin-1/2 Heisenberg model?,"  We study the phase diagram of the 2D $J_1$-$J_1'$-$J_2$ spin-1/2 Heisenberg
model by means of the coupled cluster method. The effect of the coupling $J_1'$
on the Neel and stripe states is investigated. We find that the quantum
critical points for the Neel and stripe phases increase as the coupling
strength $J_1'$ is increased, and an intermediate phase emerges above the
region at $J_1' \approx 0.6$ when $J_1=1$. We find indications for a quantum
triple point at $J_1' \approx 0.60 \pm 0.03$, $J_2 \approx 0.33 \pm 0.02$ for
$J_1=1$.
"
What are the implications of the spin blockade effect for a ferromagnet with finite size?,"  We report results for the ground state energies and wave functions obtained
by projecting spatially unrestricted Hartree Fock states to eigenstates of the
total spin and the angular momentum for harmonic quantum dots with $N\leq 12$
interacting electrons including a magnetic field states with the correct
spatial and spin symmetries have lower energies than those obtained by the
unrestricted method. The chemical potential as a function of a perpendicular
magnetic field is obtained. Signature of an intrinsic spin blockade effect is
found.
"
What are the implications of the results for the physics of the B meson decays?,"  The recent analyses of the following rare vector-vector decays of the B meson
are presented: rho K*, omega K*, omega rho, omega omega, and omega phi
charmless final states. The latest results indicate that the fraction of
longitudinal polarization is about 0.5 in penguin-dominated modes and close to
1 for tree-dominated modes.
"
What is the supersymmetry algebra in a supersymmetric field theory?,"  We construct a quantum theory of free fermion field based on the generalized
uncertainty principle using supersymmetry as a guiding principle. A
supersymmetric field theory with a real scalar field and a Majorana fermion
field is given explicitly and we also find that the supersymmetry algebra is
deformed from an usual one.
"
What are the identities obtained on the Riemann zeta function and digamma function?,"  In this paper, we introduce 3-dimensional $L-$summing method, which is a
rearrangement of the summation $\sum A_{abc}$ with $1\leq a,b,c\leq n$.
Applying this method on some special arrays, we obtain some identities on the
Riemann zeta function and digamma function. Also, we give a Maple program for
this method to obtain identities with input various arrays and out put
identities concerning some elementary functions and hypergeometric functions.
Finally, we introduce a further generalization of $L-$summing method in higher
dimension spaces.
"
What are the conditions on when a dynamical system can be projected to a lower dimensional space?,"  The reduction of dynamical systems has a rich history, with many important
applications related to stability, control and verification. Reduction of
nonlinear systems is typically performed in an exact manner - as is the case
with mechanical systems with symmetry--which, unfortunately, limits the type of
systems to which it can be applied. The goal of this paper is to consider a
more general form of reduction, termed approximate reduction, in order to
extend the class of systems that can be reduced. Using notions related to
incremental stability, we give conditions on when a dynamical system can be
projected to a lower dimensional space while providing hard bounds on the
induced errors, i.e., when it is behaviorally similar to a dynamical system on
a lower dimensional space. These concepts are illustrated on a series of
examples.
"
How can space-time relay processing be used to improve the diversity of a multihop channel?,"  We consider slow fading relay channels with a single multi-antenna
source-destination terminal pair. The source signal arrives at the destination
via N hops through N-1 layers of relays. We analyze the diversity of such
channels with fixed network size at high SNR. In the clustered case where the
relays within the same layer can have full cooperation, the cooperative
decode-and-forward (DF) scheme is shown to be optimal in terms of the
diversity-multiplexing tradeoff (DMT). The upper bound on the DMT, the cut-set
bound, is attained. In the non-clustered case, we show that the naive
amplify-and-forward (AF) scheme has the maximum multiplexing gain of the
channel but is suboptimal in diversity, as compared to the cut-set bound. To
improve the diversity, space-time relay processing is introduced through the
parallel partition of the multihop channel. The idea is to let the source
signal go through K different ""AF paths"" in the multihop channel. This parallel
AF scheme creates a parallel channel in the time domain and has the maximum
diversity if the partition is properly designed. Since this scheme does not
achieve the maximum multiplexing gain in general, we propose a flip-and-forward
(FF) scheme that is built from the parallel AF scheme. It is shown that the FF
scheme achieves both the maximum diversity and multiplexing gains in a
distributed multihop channel of arbitrary size. In order to realize the DMT
promised by the relaying strategies, approximately universal coding schemes are
also proposed.
"
What is the generalization of cluster-type Monte Carlo methods?,"  We describe a novel switching algorithm based on a ``reverse'' Monte Carlo
method, in which the potential is stochastically modified before the system
configuration is moved. This new algorithm facilitates a generalized
formulation of cluster-type Monte Carlo methods, and the generalization makes
it possible to derive cluster algorithms for systems with both discrete and
continuous degrees of freedom. The roughening transition in the sine-Gordon
model has been studied with this method, and high-accuracy simulations for
system sizes up to $1024^2$ were carried out to examine the logarithmic
divergence of the surface roughness above the transition temperature, revealing
clear evidence for universal scaling of the Kosterlitz-Thouless type.
"
What is the framework for describing dilepton pair production and direct photon production in a unified way?,"  Drell-Yan dilepton pair production and inclusive direct photon production can
be described within a unified framework in the color dipole approach. The
inclusion of non-perturbative primordial transverse momenta and DGLAP evolution
is studied. We successfully describe data for dilepton spectra from 800-GeV pp
collisions, inclusive direct photon spectra for pp collisions at RHIC energies
$\sqrt{s}=200$ GeV, and for $p\bar{p}$ collisions at Tevatron energies
$\sqrt{s}=1.8$ TeV, in a formalism that is free from any extra parameters.
"
What is the most precise measurement of the W boson mass in 2002?,"  The CDF collaboration has analyzed ~200/pb of Tevatron Run II data taken
between February 2002 and September 2003 to measure the W boson mass. With a
sample of 63964 W->e nu decays and 51128 W->mu nu decays, we measure M_W =
80413+-34(stat)+-34(syst) MeV. The total measurement uncertainty of 48 MeV
makes this result the most precise single measurement of the W boson mass to
date.
"
What are the implications of the di-hadron correlation results for PHENIX for the study of hadronization processes?,"  A selected set of di-hadron correlation results from PHENIX are discussed.
These results provide evidences for four distinct contributions concentrated at
various $\Delta\phi$ ranges. The $p_T$, particle species and energy dependence
of these contributions reflect detailed interplay between jet quenching and
response of the partonic matter to the lost energy.
"
What is the momentum map of a Poisson manifold?,"  Every action on a Poisson manifold by Poisson diffeomorphisms lifts to a
Hamiltonian action on its symplectic groupoid which has a canonically defined
momentum map. We study various properties of this momentum map as well as its
use in reduction.
"
How can adaptive mixtures of population Monte Carlo algorithms be used to improve the performance of simulation kernels?,"  In the design of efficient simulation algorithms, one is often beset with a
poor choice of proposal distributions. Although the performance of a given
simulation kernel can clarify a posteriori how adequate this kernel is for the
problem at hand, a permanent on-line modification of kernels causes concerns
about the validity of the resulting algorithm. While the issue is most often
intractable for MCMC algorithms, the equivalent version for importance sampling
algorithms can be validated quite precisely. We derive sufficient convergence
conditions for adaptive mixtures of population Monte Carlo algorithms and show
that Rao--Blackwellized versions asymptotically achieve an optimum in terms of
a Kullback divergence criterion, while more rudimentary versions do not benefit
from repeated updating.
"
What is the limit on the oscillation time for the nn' oscillations?,"  In case a mirror world with a copy of our ordinary particle spectrum would
exist, the neutron n and its degenerate partner, the mirror neutron ${\rm n'}$,
could potentially mix and undergo ${\rm nn'}$ oscillations. The interaction of
an ordinary magnetic field with the ordinary neutron would lift the degeneracy
between the mirror partners, diminish the ${\rm n'}$-amplitude in the
n-wavefunction and, thus, suppress its observability. We report an experimental
comparison of ultracold neutron storage in a trap with and without superimposed
magnetic field. No influence of the magnetic field is found and, assuming
negligible mirror magnetic fields, a limit on the oscillation time $\tau_{\rm
nn'} > 103$ s (95% C.L.) is derived.
"
What is the transformation-optical approach used to design electromagnetic and optical devices?,"  The technique of applying form-invariant, spatial coordinate transformations
of Maxwell's equations can facilitate the design of structures with unique
electromagnetic or optical functionality. Here, we illustrate the
transformation-optical approach in the designs of a square electromagnetic
cloak and an omni-directional electromagnetic field concentrator. The
transformation equations are described and the functionality of the devices is
numerically confirmed by two-dimensional finite element simulations. The two
devices presented demonstrate that the transformation optic approach leads to
the specification of complex, anisotropic and inhomogeneous materials with well
directed and distinct electromagnetic behavior.
"
What is the linearity of a dilatation structure itself?,"  A dilatation structure on a metric space, arXiv:math/0608536v4, is a notion
in between a group and a differential structure, accounting for the approximate
self-similarity of the metric space.
  The basic objects of a dilatation structure are dilatations (or
contractions). The axioms of a dilatation structure set the rules of
interaction between different dilatations.
  Linearity is also a property which can be explained with the help of a
dilatation structure. In this paper we show that we can speak about two kinds
of linearity: the linearity of a function between two dilatation structures and
the linearity of the dilatation structure itself.
  Our main result here is a characterization of contractible groups in terms of
dilatation structures. To a normed conical group (normed contractible group) we
can naturally associate a linear dilatation structure. Conversely, any linear
and strong dilatation structure comes from the dilatation structure of a normed
contractible group.
"
What are the phase diagrams obtained in the Hartree-Fock approximation in a Hubbard superlattice with Coulomb correlations at alternating sites?,"  We have studied a one dimensional Hubbard superlattice with different Coulomb
correlations at alternating sites for a half-filled band. Mean field
calculations based on the Hartree-Fock approximation together with a real space
renormalization group technique were used to study the ground state of the
system. The phase diagrams obtained in these approaches agree with each other
from the weak to the intermediate coupling regime. The mean field results show
very quick convergence with system size. The renormalization group results
indicate a spatial modulation of local moments that was identified in some
previous work. Also we have studied the magnetoconductance of such
superlattices which reveals several interesting points.
"
What are the features of p-adic numbers and p-adic norm that are used in the algorithm?,"  A new incremental algorithm for data compression is presented. For a sequence
of input symbols algorithm incrementally constructs a p-adic integer number as
an output. Decoding process starts with less significant part of a p-adic
integer and incrementally reconstructs a sequence of input symbols. Algorithm
is based on certain features of p-adic numbers and p-adic norm. p-adic coding
algorithm may be considered as of generalization a popular compression
technique - arithmetic coding algorithms. It is shown that for p = 2 the
algorithm works as integer variant of arithmetic coding; for a special class of
models it gives exactly the same codes as Huffman's algorithm, for another
special model and a specific alphabet it gives Golomb-Rice codes.
"
What is the role of the alpha-viscosity prescription in the numerical solution of the compressible Navier-Stokes equations in cataclysmic variable systems?,"  Using a 2.5D time-dependent axisymmetric numerical code we recently
developed, we solve the full compressible Navier-Stokes equations (including an
alpha-viscosity prescription) to determine the structure of the boundary layer
between the white dwarf and the accretion disk in non-magnetic cataclysmic
varia ble systems. In this preliminary work, our numerical approach does not
include radiation. In the energy equation, we either take the dissipation
function (Phi) into account or we assumed that the energy is instantly radiated
away (Phi). For a slowly rotating non magnetized accreting white dwarf, the
accretion disk e xtends all the way to the stellar surface. There, the matter
impacts and spread s towards the poles as new matter continuously piles up
behind it. We carried out numerical simulations for different values of the
alpha viscosity parameter (alpha), corresponding to different mass accretion
rates. In the high viscosity cases (alpha=0.1), the spreading boundary layer
sets off a gravity wave in the s urface matter. The accretion flow moves
supersonically over the cusp making it s usceptible to the rapid development of
gravity wave and/or Kelvin-Helmholtz shea ring instabilities. This BL is
optically thick and extends more than 30 degrees to either side of the disk
plane after only 3/4 of a Keplerian rotation period (19s). In the low viscosity
cases (alpha=0.001), the spreading boundary layer does not set off gravity
waves and it is optically thin.
"
What is the structure of the complex manifold of complex dimension 2?,"  We prove the existence of global Bishop discs in a strictly pseudoconvex
Stein domain in an almost complex manifold of complex dimension 2.
"
What are the implications of introducing coordinates representing the points of view of various observers on the concept of horizons in a region of space?,"  The introduction of coordinates representing the points of view of various
observers results in the possibility of horizons when acceleration and
gravitation are included. A horizon is a surface of possible light beams in a
region of space of finite distance from the observer, which means that since
nothing travels faster than light, events on the far side of a horizon cannot
influence those on the causal side. A black hole has such a horizon, where some
radially outgoing light beams can never reach a distant (or even nearby)
observer. However, since one suspects that black holes can swallow energy, and
even evaporate by Hawking radiation, such horizons must take on a time
dependency. A naive introduction of temporal dependency results in infinities
(singularities) in energy densities, suggesting in such descriptions that an
in-falling observer would encounter a hard surface at the horizon. However, if
coordinates representing space-time as analogous to a ""flowing river"" are used
to describe the dynamics of a black hole, no such singularities are
encountered. Such a parameterization of time dependent horizons will be offered
in this presentation. A Penrose space-time diagram (which represents the entire
space-time on a finite diagram with light beams always moving at a 45 degree
angle to vertical) describing the growth and evaporation of an example black
hole, along with the resulting coordinate anomaly, will be constructed.
"
What is the bifurcation diagram of the dynamo generation?,"  We report direct numerical simulations of dynamo generation for flow
generated using a Taylor-Green forcing. We find that the bifurcation is
subcritical, and show its bifurcation diagram. We connect the associated
hysteretic behavior with hydrodynamics changes induced by the action of the
Lorentz force. We show the geometry of the dynamo magnetic field and discuss
how the dynamo transition can be induced when an external field is applied to
the flow.
"
What is the slope of the low-mass end of the IMF of a star cluster suggested by the comparison with the MF of the Galactic globular clusters?,"  By means of deep FORS1@VLT and ACS@HST observations of a wide area in the
stellar system omega Cen we measured the luminosity function of main sequence
stars down to R=22.6 and I_{F814W}=24.5 . The luminosity functions obtained
have been converted into mass functions and compared with analytical Initial
Mass Functions (IMFs) available in the literature. The mass function obtained,
reaching M~0.15 M_s, can be well reproduced by a broken power-law with indices
alpha=-2.3 for M>0.5 M_s and alpha=-0.8 for M<0.5 M_s. Since the stellar
populations of omega Cen have been proved to be actually unaffected by
dynamical evolution processes, the mass function measured in this stellar
system should represent the best approximation of the IMF of a star cluster.
The comparison with the MF measured in other Galactic globular clusters
suggests that possible primordial differences in the slope of the low-mass end
of their MF could exist.
"
What are the discrepancies between previous thermodynamic treatments and the new thermodynamic treatment?,"  The thermodynamics with medium effects expressed by the dispersion relation
of the temperature and density dependent particle mass is studied. Many
previous treatments have been reviewed. A new thermodynamical treatment based
on the equilibrium state is suggested. Employing the quark mass density- and
temperature-dependent model, the discrepancies between our treatment and others
are addressed.
"
What are the parameters for the Kerr black hole that are in good agreement with the observed QPOs in GRS 1915+105?,"  At least four high-frequency quasiperiodic oscillations (QPOs) at frequencies
41Hz, 67Hz, 113Hz, and 167Hz were reported in a binary system GRS 1915+105
hosting near-extreme Kerr black hole with a dimensionless spin a>0.98. We use
the idea of oscillations induced by the hump of the orbital velocity profile
(related to locally non-rotating frames - LNRF) in discs orbiting near-extreme
Kerr black holes, which are characterized by a ""humpy frequency"" f_h, that
could excite the radial and vertical epicyclic oscillations with frequencies
f_r, f_v. Due to non-linear resonant phenomena the combinational frequencies
are allowed as well. Assuming mass M=14.8M_sun and spin a=0.9998 for the GRS
1915+105 Kerr black hole, the model predicts frequencies f_h=41Hz, f_r=67Hz,
(f_h+f_r)=108Hz, (f_v-f_r)=170Hz corresponding quite well to the observed ones.
For black-hole parameters being in good agreement with those given
observationally, the forced resonant phenomena in non-linear oscillations,
excited by the ""hump-induced"" oscillations in a Keplerian disc, can explain
high-frequency QPOs in GRS 1915+105 within the range of observational errors.

What are the physical parameters that best represent the conditions in the molecular clouds of each galaxy type?,"  We present theoretically-established values of the CO-to-H2 and C-to-H2
conversion factors that may be used to estimate the gas masses of external
galaxies. We consider four distinct galaxy types, represented by M51, NGC 6946,
M82 and SMC N27. The physical parameters that best represent the conditions
within the molecular clouds in each of the galaxy types are estimated using a
chi^2 analysis of several observed atomic fine structure and CO rotational
lines. This analysis is explored over a wide range of density, radiation field,
extinction, and other relevant parameters. Using these estimated physical
conditions in methods that we have previously established, CO-to-H2 conversion
factors are then computed for CO transitions up to J=9-8. For the conventional
CO(1-0) transition, the computed conversion factor varies significantly below
and above the canonical value for the Milky Way in the four galaxy types
considered. Since atomic carbon emission is now frequently used as a probe of
external galaxies, we also present, for the first time, the C-to-H2 conversion
factor for this emission in the four galaxy types considered.

"What are the implications of the ""energy to length"" ratio for a spherical region of space-time-matter?","  This paper shows one way to construct phase spaces in special relativity by
expanding Minkowski Space. These spaces appear to indicate that we can dispense
with gravitational singularities. The key mathematical ideas in the present
approach are to include a complex phase factor, such as, e^{i\phi} in the
Lorentz transformation and to use both the proper time and the proper mass as
parameters. To develop the most general case, a complex parameter \sigma=s+im,
is introduced, where s is the proper time, and m is the proper mass, and \sigma
and {\sigma}/{|\sigma|} are used to parameterize the position of a particle (or
reference frame) in space-time-matter phase space. A new reference variable,
u={m}/{r}, is needed (in addition to velocity), and assumed to be bounded by 0
and {c^{2}}/{G}=1, in geometrized units. Several results are derived: The
equation E=mc^2 apparently needs to be modified to
E^2={s^2c^{10}}/{G^2}+m^2c^4, but a simpler (invariant) parameter is the
""energy to length"" ratio, which is {c^4}/{G} for any spherical region of
space-time-matter. The generalized ""momentum vector"" becomes completely
""masslike"" for u\approx 0.79, which we think indicates the existence of a
maximal gravity field. Thus, gravitational singularities do not occur. Instead,
as u approaches 1 matter is apparently simply crushed into free space. In the
last section of this paper we attempt some further generalizations of the phase
space ideas developed in this paper.
"
What are the optical shock waves in a nonlinear medium?,"  We consider dispersive optical shock waves in nonlocal nonlinear media.
Experiments are performed using spatial beams in a thermal liquid cell, and
results agree with a hydrodynamic theory of propagation.
"
What are the implications of the angular distributions of the emitted photons in the presence of an external linear polarized radiation field?,"  The effect of an intense external linear polarized radiation field on the
angular distributions and polarization states of the photons emitted during the
radiative recombination is investigated. It is predicted, on symmetry grounds,
and corroborated by numerical calculations of approximate recombination rates,
that emission of elliptically polarized photons occurs when the momentum of the
electron beam is not aligned to the direction of the oscillating field.
Moreover, strong modifications to the angular distributions of the emitted
photons are induced by the external radiation field.
"
What is the formula for the structure maps of an A-infinity bialgebra?,"  Let p be an odd prime. When n>2, we show that each tensor factor of form E
\otimes \Gamma in H(Z,n;Z_p) is an A-infinity bialgebra with non-trivial
structure. We give explicit formulas for the structure maps and the quadratic
relations among them. Thus E \otimes \Gamma is a naturally occurring example of
an A-infinity bialgebra whose internal structure is well-understood.
"
What are the physical state and thermodynamical properties of the Intra Cluster Medium (ICM)?,"  Emission lines in X-ray spectra of clusters of galaxies reveal the presence
of heavy elements in the diffuse hot plasma (the Intra Cluster Medium, or ICM)
in virial equilibrium in the dark matter potential well. The relatively simple
physical state of the ICM allows us to estimate, with good accuracy, its
thermodynamical properties and chemical abundances. These measures put strong
constraints on the interaction processes between the galaxies and the
surrounding medium, and have significant impact on models of galaxy formation
as well. This field is rapidly evolving thanks to the X-ray satellites Chandra
and XMM-Newton. Among the most relevant progresses in the last years, we
briefly discuss the nature of cool cores and the measure of the Iron abundance
in high redshift clusters. Future X-ray missions with bolometers promise to
provide a substantial step forward to a more comprehensive understanding of the
complex physics of the ICM.
"
What is the supersymmetric Bogomolny-type model in 2+1 dimensions?,"  I consider a supersymmetric Bogomolny-type model in 2+1 dimensions
originating from topological string theory. By a gauge fixing this model is
reduced to a supersymmetric U(n) chiral model with a Wess-Zumino-Witten-type
term in 2+1 dimensions. After a noncommutative extension of the model, I employ
the dressing method to construct explicit multi-soliton configurations on
noncommutative R^{2,1|2N}.
"
What is the relationship between the waveguide and the spacelike interval?,"  Applying the fact that guided photons inside a waveguide can be treated as
massive particles, one can study the superluminality of evanescent modes via
showing that a massive particle can propagate over a spacelike interval, which
corresponds to quantum tunneling effects. For this purpose, we treat the
particle as a quantum reference frame, while attach an inertia observer to a
classical reference frame, and then quantize the formulae for the Lorentz
transformation between the quantum and classical reference frames, from which
we obtain the conclusion that, owing to the Heisenberg's uncertainty relation,
the particle can propagate over a spacelike interval.
"
What are the physical mechanisms of conductivity fluctuations due to macroscopic inhomogeneities in silver chalcogenides?,"  The silver chalcogenides provide a striking example of the benefits of
imperfection. Nanothreads of excess silver cause distortions in the current
flow that yield a linear and non-saturating transverse magnetoresistance (MR).
Associated with the large and positive MR is a negative longitudinal MR. The
longitudinal MR only occurs in the three-dimensional limit and thereby permits
the determination of a characteristic length scale set by the spatial
inhomogeneity. We find that this fundamental inhomogeneity length can be as
large as ten microns. Systematic measurements of the diagonal and off-diagonal
components of the resistivity tensor in various sample geometries show clear
evidence of the distorted current paths posited in theoretical simulations. We
use a random resistor network model to fit the linear MR, and expand it from
two to three dimensions to depict current distortions in the third (thickness)
dimension. When compared directly to experiments on Ag$_{2\pm\delta}$Se and
Ag$_{2\pm\delta}$Te, in magnetic fields up to 55 T, the model identifies
conductivity fluctuations due to macroscopic inhomogeneities as the underlying
physical mechanism. It also accounts reasonably quantitatively for the various
components of the resistivity tensor observed in the experiments.
"
What are the magnetic field effects on the Fermi surface symmetry breaking in the d-wave Pomeranchuk instability?,"  We study magnetic field effects on spontaneous Fermi surface symmetry
breaking with d-wave symmetry, the so-called d-wave ""Pomeranchuk instability''.
We use a mean-field model of electrons with a pure forward scattering
interaction on a square lattice. When either the majority or the minority spin
band is tuned close to the van Hove filling by a magnetic field, the Fermi
surface symmetry breaking occurs in both bands, but with a different magnitude
of the order parameter. The transition is typically of second order at high
temperature and changes to first order at low temperature; the end points of
the second order line are tricritical points. This qualitative picture does not
change even in the limit of a large magnetic field, although the magnetic field
substantially suppresses the transition temperature at the van Hove filling.
The field produces neither a quantum critical point nor a quantum critical end
point in our model. In the weak coupling limit, typical quantities
characterizing the phase diagram have a field-independent single energy scale
while its dimensionless coefficient varies with the field. The field-induced
Fermi surface symmetry breaking is a promising scenario for the bilayer
ruthenate Sr3Ru2O7, and future issues are discussed to establish such a
scenario.
"
What are the changes in the properties of SU-8 with the addition of SWNT?,"  Gold nanospheres, single wall carbon nanotubes (SWNT), and diamonoids were
phyically incorporated into the negative photoresist SU-8. the mixtures were
spin cast onto silicon or aluminium coated silicon wafers. ASTM standard D638
tensile specimens were lithographically patterned in the materials and then
released from the substrate using Microchem'Omnicoat or an anodic metal
dissolution process. the residual stresses, elastic moduli, and viscosity of
the SU-8. Resistivity measurements of SU-8/SWNT nanocomposites were also
investigates. We found the effective modulus and viscosity of the SU-8 test
specimens decreases with the addition of diamantane and SWNTs. Additionally,
the SU-8/SWNT nanocomposites showed changes in resistivity with increased
strain, suggesting a gauge factor for the 1 wt% SU-8/SWNT nanocomposite of
approximately 2-4.
"
"What is the contribution of X-ray undetected, mid-infrared-selected sources to the unresolved cosmic X-ray background (CXB)?","  We employ X-ray stacking techniques to examine the contribution from X-ray
undetected, mid-infrared-selected sources to the unresolved, hard (6-8 keV)
cosmic X-ray background (CXB). We use the publicly available, 24 micron Spitzer
Space Telescope MIPS catalogs from the Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey
(GOODS) - North and South fields, which are centered on the 2 Ms Chandra Deep
Field-North and the 1 Ms Chandra Deep Field-South, to identify bright (S_24 >
80 microJy) mid-infrared sources that may be powered by heavily obscured AGNs.
We measure a significant stacked X-ray signal in all of the X-ray bands
examined, including, for the first time, a significant (3.2 sigma) 6-8 keV
stacked X-ray signal from an X-ray undetected source population. We find that
the X-ray-undetected MIPS sources make up about 2% (or less) of the total CXB
below 6 keV, but about 6% in the 6-8 keV band. The 0.5-8 keV stacked X-ray
spectrum is consistent with a hard power-law (Gamma = 1.44 +/- 0.07), with the
spectrum hardening at higher X-ray energies. Our findings show that these
bright MIPS sources do contain obscured AGNs, but are not the primary source of
the unresolved 50% of 6-8 keV CXB. Our study rules out obscured, luminous QSOs
as a significant source of the remaining unresolved CXB and suggests that it
most likely arises from a large population of obscured, high-redshift (z > 1),
Seyfert-luminosity AGNs.
"
What are the key findings regarding the reliability of stellar population parameters measured from Galactic globular clusters?,"  Establishing the reliability with which stellar population parameters can be
measured is vital to extragalactic astronomy. Galactic GCs provide an excellent
medium in which to test the consistency of Single Stellar Population (SSP)
models as they should be our best analogue to a homogeneous (single) stellar
population. Here we present age, metallicity and $\alpha$-element abundance
measurements for 48 Galactic globular clusters (GCs) as determined from
integrated spectra using Lick indices and SSP models from Thomas, Maraston &
Korn, Lee & Worthey and Vazdekis et al. By comparing our new measurements to
independent determinations we are able to assess the ability of these SSPs to
derive consistent results -- a key requirement before application to
heterogeneous stellar populations like galaxies.
  We find that metallicity determinations are extremely robust, showing good
agreement for all models examined here, including a range of enhancement
methods. Ages and $\alpha$-element abundances are accurate for a subset of our
models, with the caveat that the range of these parameters in Galactic GCs is
limited. We are able to show that the application of published Lick index
response functions to models with fixed abundance ratios allows us to measure
reasonable $\alpha$-element abundances from a variety of models. We also
examine the age-metallicity and [$\alpha$/Fe]-metallicity relations predicted
by SSP models, and characterise the possible effects of varied model horizontal
branch morphology on our overall results.
"
What are the key concepts in the Lagrangian tori in the projective spaces?,"  This small note contains two simple remarks about Bohr - Sommerfeld with
respect to the anticanonical class lagrangian tori in the projective spaces,
which are the most popular examples of monotone symplectic manifolds.
"
What is the relationship between the vanadium d-electrons and the ferromagnetic correlations?,"  We report structural, magnetization, electrical resistivity and nuclear- and
electron spin resonance data of the complex transition metal oxide In_2VO_5 in
which structurally well-defined V-O chains are realized. An itinerant character
of the vanadium d-electrons and ferromagnetic correlations, revealed at high
temperatures, are contrasted with the insulating behavior and predominantly
antiferromagnetic exchange between the localized V^{4+} S = 1/2-magnetic
moments which develop below a certain characteristic temperature T* ~ 120 K.
Eventually the compound exhibits short-range magnetic order at $T_SRO ~ 20 K.
We attribute this crossover occurring around T* to the unusual anisotropic
thermal contraction of the lattice which changes significantly the overlap
integrals and the character of magnetic intra- and interchain interactions.
"
What is the Newton-Boussinesq equation defined in a two-dimensional channel?,"  We prove the existence of a global attractor for the Newton-Boussinesq
equation defined in a two-dimensional channel. The asymptotic compactness of
the equation is derived by the uniform estimates on the tails of solutions. We
also establish the regularity of the global attractor.
"
What are the mathematical formulas used to solve the Dirac equations with the pure Coulomb potential?,"  One of the simplified solutions of the Dirac equations with the pure Coulomb
potential given in a paper published in 1985 is pseudo. The original paper
solved the Dirac equations by introducing a transformation of functions with
two strange parameters a and b to transform the original system of the
first-order differential equations into two uncoupled differential equations of
second order. However, not only the given eigenvalues sets violate the
uniqueness of solution but also the said second-order equations are not any
necessarily mathematical deduction. In order to determine the introduced
parameters, formally, the author actually introduced some self-contradictory
mathematical formulas, such as sinh(theta)=2ab, cosh(theta)=a^2+b^2,
tanh(theta)=-Z(alpha)/k, a^2-b^2=1, b=sinh((theta/2), a=cosh((theta/2). But one
has not known the value of the parameters a and b all the while, whereas the
parameters were insensibly deleted in the given second-order Dirac-Coulomb
equation last. One cannot recover any result given in the paper by making
corresponding correctly mathematical calculations.
"
What are the properties of rotating pulsars with all possible compositions?,"  In the present work we investigate one possible variation on the usual static
pulsars: the inclusion of rotation. We use a formalism proposed by Hartle and
Thorne to calculate the properties of rotating pulsars with all possible
compositions. All calculations were performed for zero temperature and also for
fixed entropy equations of state.
"
What are the implications of the algebraic group for the framework of,"  This is an extended abstract of my talk at the Oberwolfach Workshop
""Algebraic Groups"" (April 22 - 28, 2007). It is based on a joint work with
H.Derksen and J.Weyman (arXiv:0704.0649v2 [math.RA]).
"
What is the application of the method to polygonal billiards on surfaces of constant curvature?,"  We introduce a new method for estimating the growth of various quantities
arising in dynamical systems. We apply our method to polygonal billiards on
surfaces of constant curvature. For instance, we obtain power bounds of degree
two plus epsilon in length for the number of billiard orbits between almost all
pairs of points in a planar polygon.
"
What is the interface sequence and how does it relate to the rotational observations of cluster and field stars?,"  We here develop an improved way of using a rotating star as a clock, set it
using the Sun, and demonstrate that it keeps time well. This technique, called
gyrochronology, permits the derivation of ages for solar- and late-type main
sequence stars using only their rotation periods and colors. The technique is
clarified and developed here, and used to derive ages for illustrative groups
of nearby, late-type field stars with measured rotation periods. We first
demonstrate the reality of the interface sequence, the unifying feature of the
rotational observations of cluster and field stars that makes the technique
possible, and extends it beyond the proposal of Skumanich by specifying the
mass dependence of rotation for these stars. We delineate which stars it cannot
currently be used on. We then calibrate the age dependence using the Sun. The
errors are propagated to understand their dependence on color and period.
Representative age errors associated with the technique are estimated at ~15%
(plus possible systematic errors) for late-F, G, K, & early-M stars. Ages
derived via gyrochronology for the Mt. Wilson stars are shown to be in good
agreement with chromospheric ages for all but the bluest stars, and probably
superior. Gyro ages are then calculated for each of the active main sequence
field stars studied by Strassmeier and collaborators where other ages are not
available. These are shown to be mostly younger than 1Gyr, with a median age of
365Myr. The sample of single, late-type main sequence field stars assembled by
Pizzolato and collaborators is then assessed, and shown to have gyro ages
ranging from under 100Myr to several Gyr, and a median age of 1.2Gyr. Finally,
we demonstrate that the individual components of the three wide binaries
XiBooAB, 61CygAB, & AlphaCenAB yield substantially the same gyro ages.
"
What is the relationship between the periodic table of weak n-categories and the category of degenerate categories?,"  We examine the periodic table of weak n-categories for the low-dimensional
cases. It is widely understood that degenerate categories give rise to monoids,
doubly degenerate bicategories to commutative monoids, and degenerate
bicategories to monoidal categories; however, to understand this correspondence
fully we examine the totalities of such structures together with maps between
them and higher maps between those. Categories naturally form a 2-category
{\bfseries Cat} so we take the full sub-2-category of this whose 0-cells are
the degenerate categories. Monoids naturally form a category, but we regard
this as a discrete 2-category to make the comparison. We show that this
construction does not yield a biequivalence; to get an equivalence we ignore
the natural transformations and consider only the {\it category} of degenerate
categories. A similar situation occurs for degenerate bicategories. The
tricategory of such does not yield an equivalence with monoidal categories; we
must consider only the categories of such structures. For doubly degenerate
bicategories the tricategory of such is not naturally triequivalent to the
category of commutative monoids (regarded as a tricategory). However in this
case considering just the categories does not give an equivalence either; to
get an equivalence we consider the {\it bicategory} of doubly degenerate
bicategories. We conclude with a hypothesis about how the above cases might
generalise for n-fold degenerate n-categories.
"
What is the relationship between coarsening kinetics and mean interface curvature?,"  Coarsening kinetics is usually described using a linear gradient
approximation for the underlying interface migration (IM) rates, wherein the
migration fluxes at the interfaces vary linearly with the driving force. Recent
experimental studies have shown that coarsening of nanocrystalline interface
microstructures is unexpectedly stable compared to conventional parabolic
coarsening kinetics. Here, we show that during early stage coarsening of these
microstructures, IM rates can develop a non-linear dependence on the driving
force, the mean interface curvature. We derive the modified mean field law for
coarsening kinetics. Molecular dynamics simulations of individual grain
boundaries reveal a sub-linear curvature dependence of IM rates, suggesting an
intrinsic origin for the slow coarsening kinetics observed in polycrystalline
metals.
"
What are the necessary and sufficient conditions for a MAC to be an elementary MAC?,"  The necessary and sufficient condition of the channel capacity is rigorously
formulated for the N-user discrete memoryless multiple-access channel (MAC).
The essence of the formulation is to invoke an {\em elementary} MAC where sizes
of input alphabets are not greater than the size of output alphabet. The main
objective is to demonstrate that the channel capacity of an MAC is achieved by
an elementary MAC included in the original MAC. The proof is quite
straightforward by the very definition of the elementary MAC. Moreover it is
proved that the Kuhn-Tucker conditions of the elementary MAC are strictly
sufficient and obviously necessary for the channel capacity. The latter proof
requires some steps such that for the elementary MAC every solution of the
Kuhn-Tucker conditions reveals itself as local maximum on the domain of all
possible input probability distributions and then it achieves the channel
capacity. As a result, in respect of the channel capacity, the MAC in general
can be regarded as an aggregate of a finite number of elementary MAC's.
"
What is the relationship between the ground state energy E_G(n) of N classical n-vector spins and the hamiltonian H?,"  We study the ground state energy E_G(n) of N classical n-vector spins with
the hamiltonian H = - \sum_{i>j} J_ij S_i.S_j where S_i and S_j are n-vectors
and the coupling constants J_ij are arbitrary. We prove that E_G(n) is
independent of n for all n > n_{max}(N) = floor((sqrt(8N+1)-1) / 2) . We show
that this bound is the best possible. We also derive an upper bound for E_G(m)
in terms of E_G(n), for m<n. We obtain an upper bound on the frustration in the
system, as measured by F(n), which is defined to be (\sum_{i>j} |J_ij| +
E_G(n)) / (\sum_{i>j} |J_ij|). We describe a procedure for constructing a set
of J_ij's such that an arbitrary given state, {S_i}, is the ground state.
"
"What are the unparticles, which are not constrained by dispersion relations but are governed by their scaling dimension, d?","  Unparticles as suggested by Georgi are identities that are not constrained by
dispersion relations but are governed by their scaling dimension, d. Their
coupling to particles can result in macroscopic interactions between matter,
that are generally an inverse nonintegral power of distance. This is totally
different from known macroscopic forces. We use the precisely measured
long-ranged spin-spin interaction of electrons to constrain unparticle
couplings to the electron. For 1<d<1.5 the axial vector unparticle coupling is
excluded; and for 1<d<1.3 the pseudoscalar and vector couplings are also ruled
out. These bounds and the ones for other ranges of d exceed or are
complementary to those obtained previously from exotic positronium decays.
"
What are the implications of the Casimir effect for the design of quantum devices?,"  We introduce the concept of Casimir friction, i.e. friction due to quantum
fluctuations. In this first article we describe the calculation of a constant
torque, arising from the scattering of quantum fluctuations, on a dielectric
rotating in an electromagnetic vacuum.
"
How can a simple individual based model predict the pattern formation of clustering in a continuum?,"  We present some numerical results obtained from a simple individual based
model that describes clustering of organisms caused by competition. Our aim is
to show how, even when a deterministic description developed for continuum
models predicts no pattern formation, an individual based model displays well
defined patterns, as a consequence of fluctuations effects caused by the
discrete nature of the interacting agents.
"
What are the conditions under which the delocalizing transition of a 1D breather in a 2D system of coupled nonlinear chains occurs?,"  We present analytical and numerical studies of phase-coherent dynamics of
intrinsically localized excitations (breathers) in a system of two weakly
coupled nonlinear oscillator chains. We show that there are two qualitatively
different dynamical regimes of the coupled breathers, either immovable or
slowly-moving: the periodic transverse translation (wandering) of low-amplitude
breather between the chains, and the one-chain-localization of high-amplitude
breather. These two modes of coupled nonlinear excitations, which involve large
number of anharmonic oscillators, can be mapped onto two solutions of a single
pendulum equation, detached by a separatrix mode. We also study two-chain
breathers, which can be considered as bound states of discrete breathers with
different symmetry and center locations in the coupled chains, and bifurcation
of the anti-phase two-chain breather into the one-chain one. Delocalizing
transition of 1D breather in 2D system of a large number of parallel coupled
nonlinear chains is described, in which the breather, initially excited in a
given chain, abruptly spreads its vibration energy in the whole 2D system upon
decreasing breather frequency or amplitude below the threshold one. The
threshold breather frequency is above the cut off phonon frequency in 2D
system, and the threshold breather amplitude scales as square root of the
inter-chain coupling constant. Delocalizing transition of discrete vibrational
breather in 2D and 3D systems of coupled nonlinear chains has an analogy with
delocalizing transition for Bose-Einstein condensates in 2D and 3D optical
lattices.
"
What are the binding energies of the homonuclear dimers of six isotopes of ytterbium determined by photoassociation spectroscopy?,"  By performing high-resolution two-color photoassociation spectroscopy, we
have successfully determined the binding energies of several of the last bound
states of the homonuclear dimers of six different isotopes of ytterbium. These
spectroscopic data are in excellent agreement with theoretical calculations
based on a simple model potential, which very precisely predicts the s-wave
scattering lengths of all 28 pairs of the seven stable isotopes. The s-wave
scattering lengths for collision of two atoms of the same isotopic species are
13.33(18) nm for ^{168}Yb, 3.38(11) nm for ^{170}Yb, -0.15(19) nm for ^{171}Yb,
-31.7(3.4) nm for ^{172}Yb, 10.55(11) nm for ^{173}Yb, 5.55(8) nm for ^{174}Yb,
and -1.28(23) nm for ^{176}Yb. The coefficient of the lead term of the
long-range van der Waals potential of the Yb_2 molecule is C_6=1932(30) atomic
units $(E_h a_0^6 \approx 9.573\times 10^{-26}$ J nm^6).
"
What are the parameters used to estimate the geometrical parameters of the source?,"  A study of Bose-Einstein correlations in pairs of identically charged pions
produced in e+e- annihilations at the Z0 peak has been performed for the first
time assuming a non-static emitting source. The results are based on the high
statistics data obtained with the OPAL detector at LEP. The correlation
functions have been analyzed in intervals of the average pair transverse
momentum and of the pair rapidity, in order to study possible correlations
between the pion production points and their momenta (position-momentum
correlations). The Yano-Koonin and the Bertsch-Pratt parameterizations have
been fitted to the measured correlation functions to estimate the geometrical
parameters of the source as well as the velocity of the source elements with
respect to the overall centre-of-mass frame. The source rapidity is found to
scale approximately with the pair rapidity, and both the longitudinal and
transverse source dimensions are found to decrease for increasing average pair
transverse momenta.
"
Is there a heuristic justification for the excess of the odious primes?,"  We give a more strong heuristic justification of our conjecture on the excess
of the odious primes.
"
What are the Lane-Emden star configurations for all adiabatic exponents $\gamma>{6/5}$?,"  We establish the local in time well-posedness of strong solutions to the
vacuum free boundary problem of the compressible Navier-Stokes-Poisson system
in the spherically symmetric and isentropic motion. Our result captures the
physical vacuum boundary behavior of the Lane-Emden star configurations for all
adiabatic exponents $\gamma>{6/5}$.
"
What is the complete answer to an Exercise of Gromov's Green book?,"  In 1999, M. Gromov introduced the box distance function $\sikaku$ on the
space of all mm-spaces. In this paper, by using the method of T. H. Colding
(cf. \cite[Lemma 5.10]{Colding}), we estimate
$\sikaku(\mathbb{S}^n,\mathbb{S}^m)$ and $\sikaku (\mathbb{C}P^n,
  \mathbb{C}P^m)$, where $\mathbb{S}^n$ is the $n$-dimensional unit sphere in
$\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ and $\mathbb{C}P^n$ is the $n$-dimensional complex
projective space equipped with the Fubini-Study metric. In paticular, we give
the complete answer to an Exercise of Gromov's Green book (cf. \cite[Section
$3{1/2}.18$]{gromov}). We also estimate $\sikaku \big(SO(n), SO(m)\big)$ from
below, where SO(n) is the special orthogonal group.
"
What are the spectra of $\pi^+$ and $\pi^-$ in Au-Au collisions?,"  The transverse mass spectra and the rapidity distributions of $\pi^+$ and
$\pi^-$ in Au-Au collisions at 2, 4, 6, and 8 GeV$\cdot$A by E895 collaboration
are fitted using an elliptically expanding fireball model with the contribution
from the resonance decays and the final state Coulomb interaction. The ratio of
the total number of produced $\pi^-$ and $\pi^+$ is used to fit the data. The
resulting freeze-out temperature is rather low($T_f < 60$ MeV) with large
transverse flow and thus resonance contribution is very small. The difference
in the shape of $m_t$ spectra of the oppositely charged pions are found to be
due to the Coulomb interaction of the pions.
"
What is the condition for the base manifold to be the space of constant sectional curvature 1 or 2?,"  We study the geometric properties of the base manifold for the unit tangent
bundle satisfying the $\eta$-Einstein condition with the standard contact
metric structure. One of the main theorems is that the unit tangent bundle of
4-dimensional Einstein manifold, equipped with the canonical contact metric
structure, is $\eta$-Einstein manifold if and only if base manifold is the
space of constant sectional curvature 1 or 2.
"
What are the astrophysical implications of CX X-ray emission?,"  The past decade has seen a surge of interest in astrophysical charge exchange
(CX). The impetus was the discovery of X-ray emission from comets in 1996, soon
followed by the observation of CX emission in planetary atmospheres and
throughout the heliosphere. Geocoronal and heliospheric CX are now recognized
to contribute a considerable fraction of the soft X-ray background, and
stellar-wind charge exchange is expected to occur in the astrospheres
surrounding many stars. CX may also contribute to X-ray line emission in
supernova remnants, the Galactic Center, and the Galactic Ridge. This article
summarizes the key aspects of CX X-ray emission and its astrophysical
relevance, and reviews related laboratory measurements and theoretical
predictions with particular attention to spectroscopy experiments conducted on
electron beam ion traps.
"
What is the relationship between the tensor localizing subcategories of finite type in Qcoh(X) and the set of all subsets Y of the form Y = ∪(i∈Ω)Yi of the quasi-compact and open for all i∈Ω?,"  Given a quasi-compact, quasi-separated scheme X, a bijection between the
tensor localizing subcategories of finite type in Qcoh(X) and the set of all
subsets $Y\subseteq X$ of the form $Y=\bigcup_{i\in\Omega}Y_i$, with
$X\setminus Y_i$ quasi-compact and open for all $i\in\Omega$, is established.
As an application, there is constructed an isomorphism of ringed spaces
(X,O_X)-->(Spec(Qcoh(X)),O_{Qcoh(X)}), where $(Spec(Qcoh(X)),O_{Qcoh(X)})$ is a
ringed space associated to the lattice of tensor localizing subcategories of
finite type. Also, a bijective correspondence between the tensor thick
subcategories of perfect complexes $\perf(X)$ and the tensor localizing
subcategories of finite type in Qcoh(X) is established.

What are the properties of the 24 special bases on a vector space?,"  Let $V$ denote a vector space with finite positive dimension. We consider a
pair of linear transformations $A : V \to V$ and $A^* : V \to V$ that satisfy
(i) and (ii) below:
  (i) There exists a basis for $V$ with respect to which the matrix
representing $A$ is irreducible tridiagonal and the matrix representing $A^*$
is diagonal.
  (ii) There exists a basis for $V$ with respect to which the matrix
representing $A^*$ is irreducible tridiagonal and the matrix representing $A$
is diagonal.
  We call such a pair a Leonard pair on $V$. In an earlier paper we described
24 special bases for $V$. One feature of these bases is that with respect to
each of them the matrices that represent $A$ and $A^*$ are (i) diagonal and
irreducible tridiagonal or (ii) irreducible tridiagonal and diagonal or (iii)
lower bidiagonal and upper bidiagonal or (iv) upper bidiagonal and lower
bidiagonal. For each ordered pair of bases among the 24, there exists a unique
linear transformation from $V$ to $V$ that sends the first basis to the second
basis; we call this the transition map. In this paper we find each transition
map explicitly as a polynomial in $A,A^*$.
"
What are the characteristics of the sources that are coincident with EGRET sources?,"  A survey of Galactic gamma-ray sources at a median energy of ~20 TeV has been
performed using the Milagro Gamma Ray Observatory. Eight candidate sources of
TeV emission are detected with pre-trials significance $>4.5\sigma$ in the
region of Galactic longitude $l\in[30^\circ,220^\circ]$ and latitude
$b\in[-10^\circ,10^\circ]$. Four of these sources, including the Crab nebula
and the recently published MGRO J2019+37, are observed with significances
$>4\sigma$ after accounting for the trials involved in searching the 3800
square degree region. All four of these sources are also coincident with EGRET
sources. Two of the lower significance sources are coincident with EGRET
sources and one of these sources is Geminga. The other two candidates are in
the Cygnus region of the Galaxy. Several of the sources appear to be spatially
extended. The fluxes of the sources at 20 TeV range from ~25% of the Crab flux
to nearly as bright as the Crab.
"
What is the drag force proportional to the cross-sectional area and velocity of the football?,"  In this paper we examine the detailed theory of the American football in
flight, with spin and air resistance included. We find the theory has much in
common with the theory of a gyroscope and also rocket trajectory with a
misaligned thruster. Unfortunately most of the air resistance data, for
rocketry and ballistics, is for speeds of Mach 1 or higher, where the air
resistance increases dramatically. We shall approximate a realistic air
resistance, at the slower speeds of football flight, with a drag force
proportional to cross sectional area and either $v$ or $v^2$, depending on
speed, where $v$ is velocity of the football. We begin with a discussion of the
motion, giving as much detail as possible without the use of complex analytic
calculations. We point out the previous errors made with moments of inertia and
make the necessary corrections for more accurate results. We show that the
shape of an American football closely resembles a parabola of revolution.
"
What are the effects in two- and three-terminal structures arising from the interplay between nonequilibrium spin and equilibrium magnetization?,"  An impressive success of spintronic applications has been typically realized
in metal-based structures which utilize magnetoresistive effects for
substantial improvements in the performance of computer hard drives and
magnetic random access memories. Correspondingly, the theoretical understanding
of spin-polarized transport is usually limited to a metallic regime in a linear
response, which, while providing a good description for data storage and
magnetic memory devices, is not sufficient for signal processing and digital
logic. In contrast, much less is known about possible applications of
semiconductor-based spintronics and spin-polarized transport in related
structures which could utilize strong intrinsic nonlinearities in
current-voltage characteristics to implement spin-based logic. Here we discuss
the challenges for realizing a particular class of structures in semiconductor
spintronics: our proposal for bipolar spintronic devices in which carriers of
both polarities (electrons and holes) contribute to spin-charge coupling. We
formulate the theoretical framework for bipolar spin-polarized transport, and
describe several novel effects in two- and three-terminal structures which
arise from the interplay between nonequilibrium spin and equilibrium
magnetization.
"
What is the relationship between the photocarrier and the thermal carrier in the photorefractive steady state self-focusing in InP:Fe?,"  This paper shows experimental evidence of photorefractive steady state
self-focusing in InP:Fe for a wide range of intensities, at both 1.06 and
1.55$\mu$m. To explain those results, it is shown that despite the bi-polar
nature of InP:Fe where one photocarrier and one thermal carrier are to be
considered, the long standing one photocarrier model for photorefractive
solitons can be usefully applied. The relationship between the dark irradiance
stemming out of this model and the known resonance intensity is then discussed.
"
What is the goal of the numerical model of the calculation of the emissivity of multi-layer systems?,"  The work which we present takes place within the framework of mission SMOS of
the ESA which will consist to send a radiometer (1.4 GHz) in space. The goal of
the research which we propose is the improvement of the comprehension of the
effects of structure soil and litter. The effects of the litter and
heterogeneities of the ground are probably important but still ignored. Its
effect can be corrected via a simple radiative model. It is thus necessary to
set up an analytical model which would make it possible to correct the effect
of this additional layer. The objective of this article is to present the
analytical models which we retained to correct the effect of the vegetation and
the litter in order to know the emissivity of the bare soil. We developed a
numerical model (with software HFSS) of calculation of the emissivity of
multi-layer systems in order to validate the results of the forward inversion
models. Ranges of permittivity are introduced with the model in order to take
account of the disturbances related to measurement and the variation of the
water content of the layers.
"
What is the formalism where fundamental variables are nilpotent?,"  We present a construction of the formalism where fundamental variables are
nilpotent, but in contrast to the supermathematics, commutative. This gives
another possibility to realize classically the Pauli exclusion principle. We
sketch the relevant formalism and discuss simple model of the nilpotent
oscillator to illustrate the generalized nilpotent mechanics.
"
What are the conditions for total and differential cross sections in a theoretical imaging method?,"  Theoretical and interpretative study on the subject of photodetachment of
H$^{-}$ near a partial reflecting surface is presented, and the absorption
effect of the surface is investigated on the total and differential cross
sections using a theoretical imaging method. To understand the absorption
effect, a reflection parameter $K$ is introduced as a multiplicative factor to
the outgoing detached-electron wave of H$^-$ propagating toward the wall. The
reflection parameter measures, how much electron wave would reflect from the
surface; K=0 corresponds to no reflection and K=1 corresponds to the total
reflection.
"
What is the scalar variance of a passive scalar field advected by incompressible flows?,"  This study is concerned with the diffusion of a passive scalar $\Theta(\r,t)$
advected by general $n$-dimensional shear flows $\u=u(y,z,...,t)\hat{x}$ having
finite mean-square velocity gradients. The unidirectionality of the
incompressible flows conserves the stream-wise scalar gradient,
$\partial_x\Theta$, allowing only the cross-stream components to be amplified
by shearing effects. This amplification is relatively weak because an important
contributing factor, $\partial_x\Theta$, is conserved, effectively rendering a
slow diffusion process. It is found that the decay of the scalar variance
$<\Theta^2>$ satisfies $d<\Theta^2>/dt\ge -C\kappa^{1/3}$, where $C>0$ is a
constant, depending on the fluid velocity gradients and initial distribution of
$\Theta$, and $\kappa$ is the molecular diffusivity. This result generalizes to
axisymmetric flows on the plane and on the sphere having finite mean-square
angular velocity gradients.
"
What are the main ideas of the new inflationary cosmology?,"  I give a general review of the history of inflationary cosmology and of its
present status.
"
What is the relationship between median metric spaces and spaces with measured walls?,"  We prove the existence of a close connection between spaces with measured
walls and median metric spaces. We then relate properties (T) and Haagerup
(a-T-menability) to actions on median spaces and on spaces with measured walls.
This allows us to explore the relationship between the classical properties (T)
and Haagerup and their versions using affine isometric actions on $L^p$-spaces.
It also allows us to answer an open problem on a dynamical characterization of
property (T), generalizing results of Robertson-Steger.
"
"How do classical F-structures, pairs of subbundles and forms, and generalized normal almost contact structures relate to generalized CRF-structures?","  A generalized F-structure is a complex, isotropic subbundle $E$ of
$T_cM\oplus T^*_cM$ ($T_cM=TM\otimes_{\mathds{R}}\mathds{C}$ and the metric is
defined by pairing) such that $E\cap\bar E^{\perp}=0$. If $E$ is also closed by
the Courant bracket, $E$ is a generalized CRF-structure. We show that a
generalized F-structure is equivalent with a skew-symmetric endomorphism $\Phi$
of $TM\oplus T^*M$ that satisfies the condition $\Phi^3+\Phi=0$ and we express
the CRF-condition by means of the Courant-Nijenhuis torsion of $\Phi$. The
structures that we consider are generalizations of the F-structures defined by
Yano and of the CR (Cauchy-Riemann) structures. We construct generalized
CRF-structures from: a classical F-structure, a pair $(\mathcal{V},\sigma)$
where $\mathcal{V}$ is an integrable subbundle of $TM$ and $\sigma$ is a 2-form
on $M$, a generalized, normal, almost contact structure of codimension $h$. We
show that a generalized complex structure on a manifold $\tilde M$ induces
generalized CRF-structures into some submanifolds $M\subseteq\tilde M$.
Finally, we consider compatible, generalized, Riemannian metrics and we define
generalized CRFK-structures that extend the generalized K\""ahler structures and
are equivalent with quadruples $(\gamma,F_+,F_-,\psi)$, where $(\gamma,F_\pm)$
are classical, metric CRF-structures, $\psi$ is a 2-form and some conditions
expressible in terms of the exterior differential $d\psi$ and the
$\gamma$-Levi-Civita covariant derivative $\nabla F_\pm$ hold. If $d\psi=0$,
the conditions reduce to the existence of two partially K\""ahler reductions of
the metric $\gamma$. The paper ends by an Appendix where we define and
characterize generalized Sasakian structures.
"
What is the Hirsch index and its relation to the g index?,"  The g index was introduced by Leo Egghe as an improvement of Hirsch's index h
for measuring the overall citation record of a set of articles. It better takes
into account the highly skewed frequency distribution of citations than the h
index. I propose to sharpen this g index by excluding the self-citations. I
have worked out nine practical cases in physics and compare the h and g values
with and without self-citations. As expected, the g index characterizes the
data set better than the h index. The influence of the self-citations appears
to be more significant for the g index than for the h index.
"
What is the optical polarisation rotation in a light beam due to a rotating medium?,"  When light is passing through a rotating medium the optical polarisation is
rotated. Recently it has been reasoned that this rotation applies also to the
transmitted image (Padgett et al. 2006). We examine these two phenomena by
extending an analysis of Player (1976) to general electromagnetic fields. We
find that in this more general case the wave equation inside the rotating
medium has to be amended by a term which is connected to the orbital angular
momentum of the light. We show that optical spin and orbital angular momentum
account respectively for the rotation of the polarisation and the rotation of
the transmitted image.
"
What are the optimal properties for variability surveys of active galactic nuclei (AGN)?,"  Active galactic nuclei (AGN) are variable on a wide range of timescales,
though relatively few systematic variability surveys have been conducted.
Previous broad-band (both spectral and temporal) variability surveys of AGN are
limited in their temporal and spectral bandwidth, despite their promise for
probing the central engine and black hole mass. We outline optimal properties
for variability studies and provide a brief summary of three new variability
surveys, two (BATSS and DASCH) about to begin and the third (EXIST) possible
within the next decade, which will open new windows on the physics and
fundamental properties of AGN.
"
What is the relation of the large deviation functional to the minimization problem?,"  We study a large deviation functional of density fluctuation by analyzing
stochastic non-linear diffusion equations driven by the difference between the
densities fixed at the boundaries. By using a fundamental equality that yields
the fluctuation theorem, we first relate the large deviation functional with a
minimization problem. We then develop a perturbation method for solving the
problem. In particular, by performing an expansion with respect to the average
current, we derive the lowest order expression for the deviation from the local
equilibrium part. This expression implies that the deviation is written as the
space-time integration of the excess entropy production rate during the most
probable process of generating the fluctuation that corresponds to the argument
of the large deviation functional.
"
What are the two conduction channels of different symmetry created by valence fluctuations of the magnetic Pu configurations?,"  We outline key elements of a theory that accounts for anomalous properties of
the PuCoGa$_5$ and PuRhGa$_5$ compounds as a consequence of a two-body
interference between two Kondo screening channels. Virtual valence fluctuations
of the magnetic Pu configurations create two conduction channels of different
symmetry. Using the symplectic large-N approach, we are able to demonstrate our
pairing mechanism in an exactly solvable large-N limit. The critical
temperature reaches its maximum when the energy levels of excited valence
configurations are almost degenerate. The symmetry of the order parameter is
determined by the product of the Wannier form factors in the interfering
conduction channels.
"
What are the saturation effects on the absorption and fluorescence spectra of an atomic vapor confined in an Extremely Thin Cell?,"  Saturation effects affecting absorption and fluorescence spectra of an atomic
vapor confined in an Extremely Thin Cell (cell thickness $L < 1 \mu m$) are
investigated experimentally and theoretically. The study is performed on the
$D_{2}$ line ($\lambda ~= ~852 nm)$ of $Cs$ and concentrates on the two
situations $L = \lambda /2$ and $L =\lambda$, the most contrasted ones with
respect to the length dependence of the coherent Dicke narrowing. For $L =
\lambda /2$, the Dicke-narrowed absorption profile simply broadens and
saturates in amplitude when increasing the light intensity, while for $L
=\lambda$, sub-Doppler dips of reduced absorption at line-center appear on the
broad absorption profile. For a fluorescence detection at $L =\lambda$,
saturation induces narrow dips, but only for hyperfine components undergoing a
population loss through optical pumping. These experimental results are
interpreted with the help of the various existing models, and are compared with
numerical calculations based upon a two-level modelling that considers both a
closed and an open system.
"
What are the solutions of the Kaluza-Klein compactification process for the anti-de Sitter and Poincaré groups?,"  The Kaluza-Klein compactification process is applied in five dimensions to CS
gravity, for the anti-de Sitter and Poincar\'e groups, using the first order
formalism. In this context some solutions are found and analyzed. Also, the
conserved charges associated to the solutions are computed.
"
What are the benefits of asynchronous space-time coded cooperative diversity schemes for wireless networks?,"  Synchronization of relay nodes is an important and critical issue in
exploiting cooperative diversity in wireless networks. In this paper, two
asynchronous cooperative diversity schemes are proposed, namely, distributed
delay diversity and asynchronous space-time coded cooperative diversity
schemes. In terms of the overall diversity-multiplexing (DM) tradeoff function,
we show that the proposed independent coding based distributed delay diversity
and asynchronous space-time coded cooperative diversity schemes achieve the
same performance as the synchronous space-time coded approach which requires an
accurate symbol-level timing synchronization to ensure signals arriving at the
destination from different relay nodes are perfectly synchronized. This
demonstrates diversity order is maintained even at the presence of asynchronism
between relay node. Moreover, when all relay nodes succeed in decoding the
source information, the asynchronous space-time coded approach is capable of
achieving better DM-tradeoff than synchronous schemes and performs equivalently
to transmitting information through a parallel fading channel as far as the
DM-tradeoff is concerned. Our results suggest the benefits of fully exploiting
the space-time degrees of freedom in multiple antenna systems by employing
asynchronous space-time codes even in a frequency flat fading channel. In
addition, it is shown asynchronous space-time coded systems are able to achieve
higher mutual information than synchronous space-time coded systems for any
finite signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) when properly selected baseband waveforms
are employed.
"
What is the concept of time in the context of quantum theory?,"  The concept of time as used in various applications and interpretations of
quantum theory is briefly reviewed.
"
What is the stability of carbon structures deposited on nickel surfaces?,"  In order to understand the first stages of the nucleation of carbon nanotubes
in catalytic processes, we present a tight-binding Monte Carlo study of the
stability and cohesive mechanisms of different carbon structures deposited on
nickel (100) surfaces. Depending on the geometry, we obtain contrasted results.
On the one hand, the analysis of the local energy distributions of flat carbon
sheets, demonstrate that dangling bonds remain unsaturated in spite of the
presence of the metallic catalyst. Their adhesion results from the energy gain
of the surface Ni atoms located below the carbon nanostructure. On the other
hand, carbon caps are stabilized by the presence of carbon atoms occupying the
hollow sites of the fcc nickel structure suggesting the saturation of the
dangling bonds.
"
What is the light shift of the 5D4 state of metastable Cr atoms?,"  We report the fast accumulation of a large number of metastable 52Cr atoms in
a mixed trap, formed by the superposition of a strongly confining optical trap
and a quadrupolar magnetic trap. The steady state is reached after about 400
ms, providing a cloud of more than one million metastable atoms at a
temperature of about 100 microK, with a peak density of 10^{18} atoms.m^{-3}.
We have optimized the loading procedure, and measured the light shift of the
5D4 state by analyzing how the trapped atoms respond to a parametric
excitation. We compare this result to a theoretical evaluation based on the
available spectroscopic data for chromium atoms.
"
What are the implications of the scattered Cherenkov light in the APF system?,"  Air fluorescence detectors measure the energy of ultra-high energy cosmic
rays by collecting fluorescence light emitted from nitrogen molecules along the
extensive air shower cascade. To ensure a reliable energy determination, the
light signal needs to be corrected for atmospheric effects, which not only
attenuate the signal, but also produce a non-negligible background component
due to scattered Cherenkov light and multiple-scattered light. The correction
requires regular measurements of the aerosol attenuation length and the aerosol
phase function, defined as the probability of light scattered in a given
direction. At the Pierre Auger Observatory in Malargue, Argentina, the phase
function is measured on an hourly basis using two Aerosol Phase Function (APF)
light sources. These sources direct a UV light beam across the field of view of
the fluorescence detectors; the phase function can be extracted from the image
of the shots in the fluorescence detector cameras. This paper describes the
design, current status, standard operation procedure, and performance of the
APF system at the Pierre Auger Observatory.
"
What is the cumulative effect of uncorrelated Langmuir waves on the radiating particle trajectory?,"  Anisotropic distributions of charged particles including two-stream
distributions give rise to generation of either stochastic electric fields (in
the form of Langmuir waves, Buneman instability) or random quasi-static
magnetic fields (Weibel and filamentation instabilities) or both. These
two-stream instabilities are known to play a key role in collisionless shock
formation, shock-shock interactions, and shock-induced electromagnetic
emission. This paper applies the general non-perturbative stochastic theory of
radiation to study electromagnetic emission produced by relativistic particles,
which random walk in the stochastic electric fields of the Langmuir waves. This
analysis takes into account the cumulative effect of uncorrelated Langmuir
waves on the radiating particle trajectory giving rise to angular diffusion of
the particle, which eventually modifies the corresponding radiation spectra. We
demonstrate that the radiative process considered is probably relevant for
emission produced in various kinds of astrophysical jets, in particular, prompt
gamma-ray burst spectra, including X-ray excesses and prompt optical flashes.
"
What is the impact of the vertical halo boundary on the local cosmic-ray anisotropy in a more realistic model of CR propagation in the Galaxy?,"  In an earlier paper, the effect of the nearby known supernova remnants (SNRs)
on the local cosmic-rays (CRs) was studied, considering different possible
forms of the particle injection time. The present work is a continuation of the
previous work, but assumes a more realistic model of CR propagation in the
Galaxy. The previous work assumed an unbounded three-dimensional diffusion
region, whereas the present one considers a flat cylindrical disc bounded in
both the radial and vertical directions. The study has found that the effect of
the vertical halo boundary $H$ on the local SNR contribution to the observed CR
anisotropy is negligible as long as $H\gtrsim 2kpc$. Considering the values of
the halo height $H\gtrsim 2kpc$ obtained by different authors, the present work
suggests that the study of the effect of local sources on the CR anisotropy can
be carried out without having much information on $H$ and hence, using the much
simpler three-dimentional unbounded solution. Finally, the present work
discusses about the possibility of explaining the observed anisotropy below the
knee by a single dominant source with properly chosen source parameters, and
claims that the source may be an \textit{undetected} old SNR with a
characteristic age of $\sim 1.5\times 10^5 yr$ located at a distance of $\sim
0.57 kpc$ from the Sun.
"
What are the sources of the extragalactic background of diffuse gamma-rays?,"  Measurement of the extragalactic background (EGBR) of diffuse gamma-rays is
perhaps one of the most challenging tasks for future gamma-ray observatories,
such as GLAST. This is because any determination will depend on accurate
subtraction of the galactic diffuse and celestial foregrounds, as well as point
sources. However, the EGBR is likely to contain very rich information about the
high energy-gamma ray sources of the Universe at cosmological distances. We
focus on the ability of GLAST to detect a signal from dark matter in the EGBR.
We present sensitivities for generic thermal WIMPs and the Inert Higgs Doublet
Model. Also we discuss the various aspects of astrophysics and particle physics
that determines the shape and strength of the signal, such as dark matter halo
properties and different dark matter candidates. Other possible sources to the
EGBR are also discussed, such as unresolved AGNs, and viewed as backgrounds.
"
What is the nature of the front of a vortex flow in a rotating superfluid 3He-B?,"  We present experimental, numerical and theoretical studies of a vortex front
propagating into a region of vortex-free flow of rotating superfluid 3He-B. We
show that the nature of the front changes from laminar through quasi-classical
turbulent to quantum turbulent with decreasing temperature. Our experiment
provides the first direct measurement of the dissipation rate in turbulent
vortex dynamics of 3He-B and demonstrates that the dissipation is temperature-
and mutual friction-independent in the T->0 limit, and is strongly suppressed
when the Kelvin-wave cascade on vortex lines is predicted to be involved in the
turbulent energy transfer to smaller length scales.
"
What is the relationship between holographic dark energy density and tachyon energy density in the FRW universe?,"  In this paper we consider a correspondence between the holographic dark
energy density and tachyon energy density in FRW universe. Then we reconstruct
the potential and the dynamics of the tachyon field which describe tachyon
cosmology.
"
What are the implications of the observed spectral indices ($\alpha$) of the point sources in the 3.6--8.0μm bands?,"  The GLIMPSE archive was used to obtain 3.6--8.0micron, point source
photometry and images for 381 massive protostellar candidates lying in the
Galactic mid-plane. The colours, magnitudes and spectral indicies of sources in
each of the 381 target fields were analysed and compared with the predictions
of 2D radiative transfer model simulations. Although no discernable embedded
clusters were found in any targets, multiple sources or associations of
redenned young stellar objects were found in many sources indicating
multiplicity at birth. The spectral index ($\alpha$) of these point sources in
3.6--8.0mum bands display large values of $\alpha$=2--5. A color-magnitude
analog plot was used to identify 79 infrared counterparts to the HMPOs. Compact
nebulae are found in 75% of the detected sources with morphologies that can be
well described by core-halo, cometary, shell-like and bipolar geometries
similar to those observed in ultra-compact HII regions. The IRAC band SEDs of
the IR counterparts of HMPOs are best described to represent YSOs with a mass
range of 8--20\msun in their Class I stages when compared with 2D radiative
transfer models. They also suggest that the high $\alpha$ values represent
reprocessed star/star+disk emission that is arising in the dense envelopes.
Thus we are witnessing the luminous envelopes around the protostars rather than
their photospheres or disks. We argue that the compact infrared nebulae likely
reflect the underlying physical structure of the dense cores and are found to
imitate the morphologies of known UCHII regions. Our results favour models of
continuuing accretion involving both molecular and ionised accretion components
to build the most massive stars rather than purely molecular rapid accretion
flows.
"
What are the main features of a pair coherent state in a harmonic oscillator basis?,"  Entanglement characteristics of a pair coherent state is studied using
entanglement of superposition. It is demonstrated only few states in the
expansion of a pair coherent state, in a harmonic oscillator basis, contribute
significantly to the entanglement. We also study a case of two superposed pair
coherent states
"
What is the relationship between the Klebanov-Strassler background and the solution describing a black hole in the class of cascading solutions?,"  We present numerical evidence for a transition between the Klebanov-Strassler
background and a solution describing a black hole in the class of cascading
solutions in the chirally restored phase. We also present a number of
properties of this solution, including the running of the coupling constant,
the viscosity to entropy ratio and the drag force on a quark moving in this
background.
"
What are the conditions for a domain to be critical for a functional on a Riemannian manifold?,"  For any bounded regular domain $\Omega$ of a real analytic Riemannian
manifold $M$, we denote by $\lambda_{k}(\Omega)$ the $k$-th eigenvalue of the
Dirichlet Laplacian of $\Omega$. In this paper, we consider $\lambda_k$ and as
a functional upon the set of domains of fixed volume in $M$. We introduce and
investigate a natural notion of critical domain for this functional. In
particular, we obtain necessary and sufficient conditions for a domain to be
critical, locally minimizing or locally maximizing for $\lambda_k$. These
results rely on Hadamard type variational formulae that we establish in this
general setting.
"
Can flavour-dependent new physics interactions in the B_q -- Bbar_q systems evade the Grossman bound?,"  We investigate new physics models that can increase the lifetime differences
in the $B_q$--$\bar{B}_q$ systems ($q = d,s$) above their standard model
values. If both $B_q$ as well as $\bar{B}_q$ can decay to a final state through
flavour dependent new physics interactions, the so-called Grossman bound may be
evaded. As examples, we consider the scalar leptoquark model and
$\lambda''$-type R-parity violating supersymmetry. We find that models with a
scalar leptoquark can enhance $\Delta\Gamma_s/\Gamma_s$ all the way up to its
experimental upper bound and $\Delta\Gamma_d/\Gamma_d$ to as much as $\sim
2.5%$, at the same time allowing the CP violating phase $\beta_s$ to vary
between $- 45^\circ$ and $20^\circ$. R-parity violating supersymmetry models
cannot enhance the lifetime differences significantly, but can enhance the
value of $\beta_s$ up to $\sim \pm 20^\circ$. This may bring the values of
$\Delta\Gamma_q/\Gamma_q$ as well as $\beta_s$ within the measurement
capabilities of $B$ factories and LHCb. We also obtain bounds on combinations
of these new physics couplings, and predict enhanced branching ratios of
$B_{s/d} \to \tau^+ \tau^-$.
"
How can non-standard four-fermion interactions affect the oscillation probabilities in neutrino experiments?,"  The formalism of non-standard four-fermion interactions provides a
convenient, model-independent way of parameterizing a wide class of ``new
physics'' scenarios. In this article, we study the performance of reactor and
superbeam neutrino experiments in the presence of such non-standard
interactions (NSI). Due to interference between the standard and non-standard
amplitudes, sizeable effects are to be expected if the NSI parameters are close
to their current upper limits. We derive approximate formulas for the relevant
oscillation probabilities including NSI, and show how the leading effects can
be understood intuitively even without any calculations. We will present a
classification of all possible NSI according to their impact on reactor and
superbeam experiments, and it will turn out that these experiments are highly
complementary in terms of their sensitivity to the non-standard parameters. The
second part of the paper is devoted to detailed numerical simulations, which
will demonstrate how a standard oscillation fit of the mixing angle theta-13
may fail if experimental data is affected by NSI. We find that for some
non-standard terms, reactor and superbeam experiments would yield seemingly
conflicting results, while in other cases, they may agree well with each other,
but the resulting value for theta-13 could be far from the true value. This
offset may be so large that the true theta-13 is even ruled out erroneously. In
the last section of the paper, we demonstrate that reactor and superbeam data
can actually establish the presence of non-standard interactions. Throughout
our discussion, we pay special attention to the impact of the complex phases,
and of the near detectors.
"
What are the potential and dynamics of the scalar field which describe the Chaplygin cosmology?,"  In this paper we consider a correspondence between the holographic dark
energy density and Chaplygin gas energy density in FRW universe. Then we
reconstruct the potential and the dynamics of the scalar field which describe
the Chaplygin cosmology.
"
What are the metallicity distributions vs. radius for the Andromeda galaxy?,"  We have used Suprime-Cam on the Subaru Telescope to conduct a V- and I-band
imaging survey of fields sampling the spheroid of the Andromeda galaxy along
its south-east minor axis. Our photometric data are deep enough to resolve
stars down to the red clump. Based on a large and reliable sample of red giant
stars available from this deep wide-field imager, we have derived metallicity
distributions vs. radius and a surface brightness profile over projected
distances of R=23-66 kpc from the galaxy's center. The metallicity
distributions across this region shows a clear high mean metallicity and a
broad distribution ([Fe/H] ~ -0.6 +/- 0.5), and indicates no metallicity
gradient within our observed range. The surface brightness profile at R>40 kpc
is found to be flatter than previously thought. It is conceivable that this
part of the halo samples as yet unidentified, metal-rich substructure.
"
What are the formulae relating elements expressed in terms of symmetric functions to Turaev's geometrical basis of C+?,"  The oriented framed Homfly skein C of the annulus provides the natural
parameter space for the Homfly satellite invariants of a knot. It contains a
submodule C+ isomorphic to the algebra of the symmetric functions.
  We collect and expand formulae relating elements expressed in terms of
symmetric functions to Turaev's geometrical basis of C+. We reformulate the
formulae of Rosso and Jones for quantum sl(N) invariants of cables in terms of
plethysms of symmetric functions, and use the connection between quantum sl(N)
invariants and C+ to give a formula for the satellite of a cable as an element
of C+. We then analyse the case where a cable is decorated by the pattern which
corresponds to a power sum in the symmetric function interpretation of C+ to
get direct relations between the Homfly invariants of some diagrams decorated
by power sums.
"
What is the continuum limit of the polymer representation of quantum mechanics?,"  A rather non-standard quantum representation of the canonical commutation
relations of quantum mechanics systems, known as the polymer representation has
gained some attention in recent years, due to its possible relation with Planck
scale physics. In particular, this approach has been followed in a symmetric
sector of loop quantum gravity known as loop quantum cosmology. Here we explore
different aspects of the relation between the ordinary Schroedinger theory and
the polymer description. The paper has two parts. In the first one, we derive
the polymer quantum mechanics starting from the ordinary Schroedinger theory
and show that the polymer description arises as an appropriate limit. In the
second part we consider the continuum limit of this theory, namely, the reverse
process in which one starts from the discrete theory and tries to recover back
the ordinary Schroedinger quantum mechanics. We consider several examples of
interest, including the harmonic oscillator, the free particle and a simple
cosmological model.
"
What are the features of the two-level equations used in pulse Areas in the 2$\pi$ range?,"  We examine fully coherent two-pulse propagation in a lambda-type medium,
under two-photon resonance conditions and including inhomogeneous broadening.
We examine both the effects of short pulse preparation and the effects of
medium preparation. We contrast cases in which the two pulses have matched
envelopes or not, and contrast cases in which ground state coherence is present
or not. We find that an extended interpretation of the Area Theorem for
single-pulse self-induced transparency (SIT) is able to unify two-pulse
propagation scenarios, including some aspects of electromagnetically-induced
transparency (EIT) and stimulated Raman scattering (SRS). We present numerical
solutions of both three-level and adiabatically reduced two-level density
matrix equations and Maxwell's equations, and show that many features of the
solutions are quickly interpreted with the aid of analytic solutions that we
also provide for restricted cases of pulse shapes and preparation of the
medium. In the limit of large one-photon detuning, we show that the two-level
equations commonly used are not reliable for pulse Areas in the 2$\pi$ range,
which allows puzzling features of previous numerical work to be understood.
"
What is the main contribution to the doping evolution of the band structure and Fermi surface in the underdoped cuprates?,"  In the present work we report the band structure calculations for the high
temperature superconductor Nd$_{2-x}$Ce$_x$CuO$_4$ in the regime of strong
electronic correlations within an LDA+GTB method, which combines the local
density approximation (LDA) and the generalized tight-binding method (GTB). The
two mechanisms of band structure doping dependence were taken into account.
Namely, the one-electron mechanism provided by the doping dependence of the
crystal structure, and the many-body mechanism provided by the strong
renormalization of the fermionic quasiparticles due to the large on-site
Coulomb repulsion. We have shown that in the antiferromagnetic and in the
strongly correlated paramagnetic phases of the underdoped cuprates the main
contribution to the doping evolution of band structure and Fermi surface comes
from the many-body mechanism.
"
What is the relationship between PT-symmetric operators and Hermitian operators?,"  Recently, much research has been carried out on Hamiltonians that are not
Hermitian but are symmetric under space-time reflection, that is, Hamiltonians
that exhibit PT symmetry. Investigations of the Sturm-Liouville eigenvalue
problem associated with such Hamiltonians have shown that in many cases the
entire energy spectrum is real and positive and that the eigenfunctions form an
orthogonal and complete basis. Furthermore, the quantum theories determined by
such Hamiltonians have been shown to be consistent in the sense that the
probabilities are positive and the dynamical trajectories are unitary. However,
the geometrical structures that underlie quantum theories formulated in terms
of such Hamiltonians have hitherto not been fully understood. This paper
studies in detail the geometric properties of a Hilbert space endowed with a
parity structure and analyses the characteristics of a PT-symmetric Hamiltonian
and its eigenstates. A canonical relationship between a PT-symmetric operator
and a Hermitian operator is established. It is shown that the quadratic form
corresponding to the parity operator, in particular, gives rise to a natural
partition of the Hilbert space into two halves corresponding to states having
positive and negative PT norm. The indefiniteness of the norm can be
circumvented by introducing a symmetry operator C that defines a positive
definite inner product by means of a CPT conjugation operation.
"
What is the dual Feynman transform of a modular operad?,"  We introduce and study the notion of a dual Feynman transform of a modular
operad. This generalizes and gives a conceptual explanation of Kontsevich's
dual construction producing graph cohomology classes from a contractible
differential graded Frobenius algebra. The dual Feynman transform of a modular
operad is indeed linear dual to the Feynman transform introduced by Getzler and
Kapranov when evaluated on vacuum graphs. In marked contrast to the Feynman
transform, the dual notion admits an extremely simple presentation via
generators and relations; this leads to an explicit and easy description of its
algebras. We discuss a further generalization of the dual Feynman transform
whose algebras are not necessarily contractible. This naturally gives rise to a
two-colored graph complex analogous to the Boardman-Vogt topological tree
complex.
"
What is the Nash equilibrium for a noncooperative game in a frequency-selective multipath environment?,"  In this paper, a game-theoretic model for studying power control for wireless
data networks in frequency-selective multipath environments is analyzed. The
uplink of an impulse-radio ultrawideband system is considered. The effects of
self-interference and multiple-access interference on the performance of Rake
receivers are investigated for synchronous systems. Focusing on energy
efficiency, a noncooperative game is proposed in which users in the network are
allowed to choose their transmit powers to maximize their own utilities, and
the Nash equilibrium for the proposed game is derived. It is shown that, due to
the frequency selective multipath, the noncooperative solution is achieved at
different signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratios, respectively of the channel
realization. A large-system analysis is performed to derive explicit
expressions for the achieved utilities. The Pareto-optimal (cooperative)
solution is also discussed and compared with the noncooperative approach.
"
What are the surface brightness changes observed in the C2004B1 comet?,"  We present R-band observations of comet C2004B1 obtained in the period June,
21 - August 20, 2006. The data have been reduced to surface brightness maps,
light curves, and mean radial profiles of the coma. In two cases a decrease of
the brightness was recorded, which lasted for several days. The brightness
decrease was accompanied by morphological changes in the coma.
"
What are the implications of the standard constraint omega.omega=0 for superstring compactifications on twisted tori?,"  Exploiting the fact that Kaluza-Klein monopoles and the associated
generalized orbifold planes are sources for geometrical fluxes, omega, we show
that the standard constraint omega.omega=0, valid for superstring
compactifications on twisted tori, can be consistently relaxed. This leads to
novel possibilities for constructing superstring models with fluxes and
localized sources, as well as for stabilizing moduli. This also explains the
ten-dimensional origin of a family of N=4 gauged supergravities, whose
interpretation in type-IIA orientifold compactifications was lacking.
"
What are the nonlocal interactions responsible for the bottleneck effect in isotropic turbulence at small Reynolds numbers?,"  It is shown that nonlocal interactions determine energy spectrum in isotropic
turbulence at small Reynolds numbers. It is also shown that for moderate
Reynolds numbers the bottleneck effect is determined by the same nonlocal
interactions. Role of the large and small scales covariance at the nonlocal
interactions and in energy balance has been investigated. A possible
hydrodynamic mechanism of the nonlocal solution instability at large scales has
been briefly discussed. A quantitative relationship between effective strain of
the nonlocal interactions and viscosity has been found. All results are
supported by comparison with the data of experiments and numerical simulations.
"
What is the relationship between the critical velocity and the onset of dissipation in the BEC-BCS crossover?,"  Critical velocities have been observed in an ultracold superfluid Fermi gas
throughout the BEC-BCS crossover. A pronounced peak of the critical velocity at
unitarity demonstrates that superfluidity is most robust for resonant atomic
interactions. Critical velocities were determined from the abrupt onset of
dissipation when the velocity of a moving one dimensional optical lattice was
varied. The dependence of the critical velocity on lattice depth and on the
inhomogeneous density profile was studied.
"
What is the Caputo differential operator used in the temperature field in oil strata?,"  In the present paper, we solve three boundary value problems related to the
temperature field in oil strata -- the fractional extensions of the incomplete
lumped formulation and lumped formulation in the linear case and the fractional
generalization of the incomplete lumped formulation in the radial case. By
using the Caputo differintegral operator and the Laplace transform, the
solutions are obtained in integral forms where the integrand is expressed in
terms of the convolution of some auxiliary functions of Wright function type. A
generalization of the Laplace transform convolution theorem, known as Efros'
theorem is widely used.
"
What are the key concepts in a semantic network substrate for computing?,"  We present a new variational model for computing the electronic first-order
density matrix of a crystalline material in presence of a local defect. A
natural way to obtain variational discretizations of this model is to expand
the difference Q between the density matrix of the defective crystal and the
density matrix of the perfect crystal, in a basis of precomputed maximally
localized Wannier functions of the reference perfect crystal. This approach can
be used within any semi-empirical or Density Functional Theory framework.
"
What are the CV action and its relation to the density correlation functions?,"  Using the collective variables (CV) method the basic relations of statistical
field theory of a multicomponent non-homogeneous fluids are reconsidered. The
corresponding CV action depends on two sets of scalar fields - fields
$\rho_{\alpha}$ connected to the local density fluctuations of the $\alpha$th
species of particles and fields $\omega_{\alpha}$ conjugated to
$\rho_{\alpha}$. The explicit expressions for the CV field correlations and
their relation to the density correlation functions are found. The perturbation
theory is formulated and a mean field level (MF) of the theory is considered in
detail.
"
What are the conditions for the subspaces of the moduli space on which a quarter BPS dyon becomes marginally unstable?,"  The degeneracy of quarter BPS dyons in N=4 supersymmetric string theories is
known to jump across walls of marginal stability on which a quarter BPS dyon
can decay into a pair of half BPS dyons. We show that as long as the electric
and magnetic charges of the original dyon are primitive elements of the charge
lattice, the subspaces of the moduli space on which a quarter BPS dyon becomes
marginally unstable against decay into a pair of quarter BPS dyons or a half
BPS dyon and a quarter BPS dyon are of codimension two or more. As a result any
pair of generic points in the moduli space can be connected by a path avoiding
these subspaces and there is no jump in the spectrum associated with these
subspaces.
"
What is the method of deforming contact manifolds used to quantize odd dimensional anti-de Sitter spaces?,"  We quantize odd dimensional anti-de Sitter spaces by applying the method of
deforming contact manifolds proposed by Rajeev. The construction in the present
paper consists of the identification of the odd dimensional anti-de Sitter
space as a hypersurface of contact type and the subsequent use of
'symplectization' principle. We also show that this construction generalizes to
any odd dimensional hypersurface which can be represented as a nonzero level
set of a homogenous function.
"
What are the conditions for the pitch p of the end of a caustic of a flat surface?,"  In this paper, we investigate the asymptotic behavior of regular ends of flat
surfaces in the hyperbolic 3-space H^3. Galvez, Martinez and Milan showed that
when the singular set does not accumulate at an end, the end is asymptotic to a
rotationally symmetric flat surface. As a refinement of their result, we show
that the asymptotic order (called ""pitch"" p) of the end determines the limiting
shape, even when the singular set does accumulate at the end. If the singular
set is bounded away from the end, we have -1<p<=0. If the singular set
accumulates at the end, the pitch p is a positive rational number not equal to
1. Choosing appropriate positive integers n and m so that p=n/m, suitable
slices of the end by horospheres are asymptotic to d-coverings (d-times wrapped
coverings) of epicycloids or d-coverings of hypocycloids with 2n_0 cusps and
whose normal directions have winding number m_0, where n=n_0d, m=m_0d (n_0, m_0
are integers or half-integers) and d is the greatest common divisor of m-n and
m+n. Furthermore, it is known that the caustics of flat surfaces are also flat.
So, as an application, we give a useful explicit formula for the pitch of ends
of caustics of complete flat fronts.
"
What is the relationship between the photon antibunching and Auger processes in carbon nanotubes?,"  We report the first observation of photon antibunching in the
photoluminescence from single carbon nanotubes. The emergence of a fast
luminescence decay component under strong optical excitation indicates that
Auger processes are partially responsible for inhibiting two-photon generation.
Additionally, the presence of exciton localization at low temperatures ensures
that nanotubes emit photons predominantly one by one. The fact that multiphoton
emission probability can be smaller than 5% suggests that carbon nanotubes
could be used as a source of single photons for applications in quantum
cryptography.
"
What are the algorithms for designing a regular controller with few control channels?,"  We study control problems for linear systems in the behavioral framework. Our
focus is a class of regular controllers that are equivalent to the canonical
controller. The canonical controller is a particular controller that is
guaranteed to be a solution whenever a solution exists. However, it has been
shown that in most cases, the canonical controller is not regular. The main
result of the paper is a parametrization of all regular controllers that are
equivalent to the canonical controller. The parametrization is then used to
solve two control problems. The first problem is related to designing a regular
controller that uses as few control channels as possible. The second problem is
to design a regular controller that satisfies a predefined input-output
partitioning constraint. In both problems, based on the parametrization, we
present algorithms that does the controller design.
"
What are the prospects of building a km3 neutrino telescope in the North hemisphere?,"  In this contribution we will discuss recent results concerning the intensity
and the angular distribution of the gamma-ray and neutrino emissions as should
be originated from the hadronic scattering of cosmic rays (CR) with the
interstellar medium (ISM). We assumed that CR sources are supernova remnants
(SNR) and estimated the spatial distribution of primary nuclei by solving
numerically the diffusion equation. For the ISM, we considered recent models
for the 3D spatial distributions of molecular hydrogen. Respect to previous
results, we find the secondary gamma-ray and neutrino emissions to be more
peaked along the galactic equator and in the galactic centre which improves
significantly the perspectives of a positive detection. We compare our
predictions with the experimental limits/observations by MILAGRO and TIBET (for
the gamma-rays) and by AMANDA-II (for the neutrinos) and discuss the detection
perspectives for a km3 neutrino telescope to be built in the North hemisphere.
"
What are the conditions under which spectral splits are created in the neutrino-neutrino region?,"  In the dense-neutrino region above the neutrino sphere of a supernova (r >
400 km), neutrino-neutrino refraction causes collective flavor transformations.
They can lead to ""spectral splits"" where an energy E_split splits the
transformed spectrum sharply into parts of almost pure but different flavors.
Unless there is an ordinary MSW resonance in the dense-neutrino region, E_split
is determined by flavor-lepton number conservation alone. Spectral splits are
created by an adiabatic transition between regions of large and small neutrino
density. We solve the equations of motion in the adiabatic limit explicitly and
provide analytic expressions for a generic example.
"
What are the Casimir energy density terms in the Horava-Witten theory in the presence of compactified CH^3?,"  The field equations and boundary conditions of Horava-Witten theory,
compactified on a smooth compact spin quotient of CH^3, where CH^3 denotes the
hyperbolic cousin of CP^3, are studied in the presence of Casimir energy
density terms. If the Casimir energy densities near one boundary result in a
certain constant of integration taking a value greater than around 10^5 in
units of the d = 11 gravitational length, a form of thick pipe geometry is
found that realizes TeV-scale gravity by the ADD mechanism, with that boundary
becoming the inner surface of the thick pipe, where we live. Three alternative
ways in which the outer surface of the thick pipe might be stabilized
consistent with the observed value of the effective d = 4 cosmological constant
are considered. In the first alternative, the outer surface is stabilized in
the classical region and the constant of integration is fixed at around 10^{13}
in units of the d = 11 gravitational length for consistency with the observed
cosmological constant. In the second alternative, the four observed dimensions
have reduced in size down to the d = 11 gravitational length at the outer
surface, and there are Casimir effects near the outer surface. In the third
alternative, the outer surface is stabilized in the classical region by extra
fluxes of the three-form gauge field, whose four-form field strength wraps
three-cycles of the compact six-manifold times the radial dimension of the
thick pipe. Some problems related to fitting the strong/electroweak Standard
Model are considered.
"
What are the correlations between the pixels of a pixelized detector that are used to determine the presampled two-dimensional point-spread function (PSF0)?,"  A novel method to estimate the pixels simultaneous detection probability and
the spatial resolution of pixelized detectors is proposed, which is based on
the determination of the statistical correlations between detector neighbor
pixels. The correlations are determined by means of noise variance measurement
for a isolated pixels and the difference between neighbor pixels. The method is
validated using images from the two different GE Senographe 2000D mammographic
units. The pixelized detector has been irradiated using x-rays along its entire
surface. It is shown that the pixel simultaneous detection probabilities can be
estimated within accuracy 0.001 - 0.003, where the systematic error is
estimated to be smaller than 0.005. The presampled two-dimensional point-spread
function (PSF0) is determined using a single Gaussian and a sum of two Gaussian
approximations. The obtained results for the presampled PSF0 show that the
single Gaussian approximation is not appropriate, and the sum of two Gaussian
approximations providing the best fit predicts the existence of a large (~50%)
narrow component. Another proof of this fact is the latest simulation study of
columnar indirect digital detectors by A. Badano et al. The sampled
two-dimensional PSF is determined using Monte Carlo simulation for the L-shape
uniform distributed acceptance function for different values of fill factors.
The detector spatial resolution is estimated using sampled PSF and has values
54 and 58 mkm for two different units. The calculation of the presampled
modulation transfer function based on the PSF0 estimation shows that the
existing data can only be reproduced using a single Gaussian approximation and
the usage of the sum of two Gaussian show significantly larger values in the
higher frequency region for both units.
"
What is the mechanism at the heart of the phenomenon of non-locality in PFT?,"  Puff field theories (PFT) arise as the decoupling limits of D3 branes in a
Melvin universe and exhibit spatially non-local dynamics. Unlike other
realizations of non-locality in string theory, PFTs have full SO(3) rotational
symmetry. In this work, we analyze the strongly coupled regime of a PFT through
gravitational holography. We find a novel mechanism at the heart of the
phenomenon of non-locality: a quantum entanglement of UV and IR dynamics. In
the holographic bulk, this translates to an apparent horizon splitting the
space into two regions - with the UV completion of the PFT sitting at the
horizon. We unravel this intricate UV-IR setting and devise a prescription for
computing correlators that extends the original dictionary of holographic
renormalization group. We then implement a cosmological scenario where PFT
correlators set the initial conditions for primordial fluctuations. We compute
the associated power spectrum of the CMB and find that the scenario allows for
a distinct stringy signature.
"
What is the relationship between the masses of stars and the orbital distances of their planets?,"  We report precision Doppler measurements of three intermediate-mass subgiants
from Lick and Keck Observatories. All three stars show variability in their
radial velocities consistent with planet-mass companions in Keplerian orbits.
We find a planet with a minimum mass of 2.5 Mjup in a 351.5 day orbit around HD
192699, a planet with a minimum mass of 2.0 Mjup in a 341.1 day orbit around HD
210702, and a planet with a minimum mass of 0.61 Mjup in a 297.3 day orbit
around HD 175541. Stellar mass estimates from evolutionary models indicate that
all of these stars were formerly A-type dwarfs with masses ranging from 1.65 to
1.85 Msun. These three long-period planets would not have been detectable
during their stars' main-sequence phases due to the large rotational velocities
and stellar jitter exhibited by early-type dwarfs. There are now 9 ""retired""
(evolved) A-type stars (Mstar > 1.6 Msun) with known planets. All 9 planets
orbit at distances a \geq 0.78 AU, which is significantly different than the
semimajor axis distribution of planets around lower-mass stars. We examine the
possibility that the observed lack of close-in planets is due to engulfment by
their expanding host stars, but we find that this explanation is inadequate
given the relatively small stellar radii of K giants (Rstar < 32 Rsun = 0.15
AU) and subgiants (Rstar < 7 Rsun = 0.03 AU). Instead, we conclude that planets
around intermediate-mass stars reside preferentially beyond ~0.8 AU, which may
be a reflection of different formation and migration histories of planets
around A-type stars.
"
What are the optical variability characteristics of AGN candidates that have mid-IR power-law SEDs?,"  We investigate the use of optical variability to identify and study Active
Galactic Nuclei (AGN) in the GOODS-South field. A sample of 22 mid-infrared
power law sources and 102 X-ray sources with optical counterparts in the HST
ACS images were selected. Each object is classified with a variability
significance value related to the standard deviation of its magnitude in five
epochs separated by 45-day intervals. The variability significance is compared
to the optical, mid-IR, and X-ray properties of the sources. We find that 26%
of all AGN candidates (either X-ray- or mid-IR-selected) are optical variables.
The fraction of optical variables increases to 51% when considering sources
with soft X-ray band ratios. For the mid-IR AGN candidates which have
multiwavelength SEDs, we find optical variability for 64% of those classified
with SEDs like Broad Line AGNs. While mostly unobscured AGN appear to have the
most significant optical variability, some of the more obscured AGNs are also
observed as variables. In particular, we find two mid-IR power law-selected AGN
candidates without X-ray emission that display optical variability, confirming
their AGN nature.
"
What is the effect of the deformation on the dispersion relation for the single spike string solution?,"  We study rigid string solutions rotating on the S^3 subspace of the
beta-deformed AdS_5xS^5 background found by Lunin and Maldacena. For particular
values of the parameters of the solutions we find the known giant magnon and
single spike strings. We present a single spike string solution on the deformed
S^3 and find how the deformation affects the dispersion relation. The possible
relation of this string solution to spin chains and the connection of the
solutions on the undeformed S^3 to the sine-Gordon model are briefly discussed.
"
What is the purpose of the SIM PlanetQuest Key project?,"  We present a review of precursor observing programs for the SIM PlanetQuest
Key project devoted to detecting Jupiter mass planets around young stars. In
order to ensure that the stars in the sample are free of various sources of
astrometric noise that might impede the detection of planets, we have initiated
programs to collect photometry, high contrast images, interferometric data and
radial velocities for stars in both the Northern and Southern hemispheres. We
have completed a high contrast imaging survey of target stars in Taurus and the
Pleiades and found no definitive common proper motion companions within one
arcsecond (140 AU) of the SIM targets. Our radial velocity surveys have shown
that many of the target stars in Sco-Cen are fast rotators and a few stars in
Taurus and the Pleiades may have sub-stellar companions. Interferometric data
of a few stars in Taurus show no signs of stellar or sub-stellar companions
with separations of <5 mas. The photometric survey suggests that approximately
half of the stars initially selected for this program are variable to a degree
(1 sigma>0.1 mag) that would degrade the astrometric accuracy achievable for
that star. While the precursor programs are still a work in progress, we
provide a comprehensive list of all targets ranked according to their viability
as a result of the observations taken to date. By far, the observable that
moves the most targets from the SIM-YSO program is photometric variability.
"
What is the Birch-Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture about the twisted L-values for an elliptic curve?,"  Let E be an elliptic curved defined over $\Q$ and let $K/\Q$ be a finite
Galois extension with Galois group G. The equivariant Birch-Swinnerton-Dyer
conjecture for $h^1(E\times_{\Q} K)(1)$ viewed as a motive over $\Q$ with
coefficients in $\Q[G]$ relates the twisted L-values associated with E with the
arithmetic invariants of the same. In this paper we prescribe an approach to
verify this conjecture for a given data. Using this approach, we verify the
conjecture for an elliptic curve of conductor 11 and an S_3-extension of $\Q$.
"
What are the implications of Efimov states for the structure of neutron-rich nuclei?,"  Efimov's prediction more than three decades ago that three-body bound states
can exist when the pairwise attractions do not bind or only support weakly
bound states of a pair, has remained unconfirmed till just the past year. This
lecture provides the pedagogical background for recent work on Efimov states in
neutron-rich nuclei done with I. Mazumdar (TIFR) and V. S. Bhasin (Delhi
University), and published in Phys. Rev. Lett. 97, 062503 (2006). Both these
nuclear systems and recent observations of cold cesium atoms provide the first
clear evidence for the existence of Efimov states.
"
How many conjugates of algebraic numbers of degree n and algebraic integers of degree n+1 are involved in the calculation?,"  Using a method of H. Davenport and W. M. Schmidt, we show that, for each
positive integer n, the ratio 2/n is the optimal exponent of simultaneous
approximation to real irrational numbers 1) by all conjugates of algebraic
numbers of degree n, and 2) by all but one conjugates of algebraic integers of
degree n+1.
"
How do the formation rates of low-mass X-ray binaries depend on the number of collisions in globular clusters?,"  In this paper, the second of a series, we study the stellar dynamical and
evolutionary processes leading to the formation of compact binaries containing
neutron stars (NSs) in dense globular clusters (GCs). For this study, 70 dense
clusters were simulated independently, with a total stellar mass ~2x10^7Msun,
exceeding the total mass of all dense GCs in our Galaxy.
  We find that, in order to reproduce the empirically derived formation rate of
low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs), we must assume that NSs can be formed via
electron-capture supernovae (ECS) with typical natal kicks smaller than in
core-collapse supernovae. Our results explain the observed dependence of the
number of LMXBs on ``collision number'' as well as the large scatter observed
between different GCs. We predict that the number of quiescent LMXBs in
different GCs should not have a strong metallicity dependence. In our cluster
model the following mass-gaining events create populations of MSPs that do not
match the observations: (i) accretion during a common envelope event with a NS
formed through ECS, and (ii) mass transfer (MT) from a WD donor. Some processes
lead only to a mild recycling. In addition, for MSPs, we distinguish
low-magnetic-field (long-lived) and high-magnetic-field (short-lived)
populations. With this distinction and by considering only those mass-gaining
events that appear to lead to NS recycling, we obtain good agreement of our
models with the numbers and characteristics of observed MSPs in 47 Tuc and
Terzan 5, as well as with the cumulative statistics for MSPs detected in GCs of
different dynamical properties. We find that significant production of merging
double NSs potentially detectable as short gamma-ray bursts occurs only in very
dense, most likely core-collapsed GCs. (abridged)
"
What are the comments on six papers published in the field of heat and mass transfer?,"  Comments on six papers published by S.P. Anjali Devi and R. Kandasamy in Heat
and Mass Transfer, ZAMM, Mechanics Research Communications, International
Communications in Heat and Mass Transfer, Communications in Numerical Methods
in Engineering, Journal of Computational and Applied Mechanics
  In conclusion all the above papers are of very low quality, written without
care and are partly or completely wrong.
"
What are the conditions for neglecting dimensions in the potential box model?,"  Fermi and kinetic energy are usually calculated in periodic boundary
conditions model, which is not self-consistent for low-dimensional problems,
where particles are confined. Thus for confined particles the potential box
model was used self-consistently to calculate Fermi and kinetic energies in 3-,
2-, and 1-dimensional cases. This approach is much more logical and
self-consistent. Then the conditions for neglecting dimensions, that is
conditions under which the movement of particles in the box could be considered
as 2- and 1- dimensional, were derived.
"
What are the results of the first non-local four-probe experiments on graphene contacted by ferromagnetic Permalloy electrodes?,"  Graphitic nanostructures, e.g. carbon nanotubes (CNT) and graphene, have been
proposed as ideal materials for spin conduction[1-7]; they have long electronic
mean free paths[8] and small spin-orbit coupling[9], hence are expected to have
very long spin-scattering times. In addition, spin injection and detection in
graphene opens new opportunities to study exotic electronic states such as the
quantum Hall[10,11] and quantum spin Hall[9] states, and spin-polarized edge
states[12] in graphene ribbons. Here we perform the first non-local four-probe
experiments[13] on graphene contacted by ferromagnetic Permalloy electrodes. We
observe sharp switching and often sign-reversal of the non-local resistance at
the coercive field of the electrodes, indicating definitively the presence of a
spin current between injector and detector. The non-local resistance changes
magnitude and sign quasi-periodically with back-gate voltage, and
Fabry-Perot-like oscillations[6,14,15] are observed, consistent with
quantum-coherent transport. The non-local resistance signal can be observed up
to at least T = 300 K.
"
"What are the asymptotic behaviors of the l^p-distortion of finite quotients of certain metabelian polycyclic groups and of the solvable Baumslag-Solitar groups BS(m,1)?","  We study the L^p-distortion of finite quotients of amenable groups. In
particular, for every number p larger or equal than 2, we prove that the
l^p-distortion of the finite lamplighter group grows like (\log n)^{1/p}. We
also give the asymptotic behavior of the l^p-distortion of finite quotients of
certain metabelian polycyclic groups and of the solvable Baumslag-Solitar
groups BS(m,1). The proofs are short and elementary.
"
What is the role of photoevaporation in regulating star formation in primordial star clusters?,"  We present numerical simulations of how a 120 M$_\odot$ primordial star
regulates star formation in nearby cosmological halos at $z \sim$ 20 by
photoevaporation. Our models include nine-species primordial chemistry and
self-consistent multifrequency conservative transfer of UV photons with all
relevant radiative processes. Whether or not new stars form in halos clustered
around a Population III star ultimately depends on their core densities and
proximity to the star. Diffuse halos with central densities below 2 - 3
cm$^{-3}$ are completely ionized and evaporated anywhere in the cluster.
Evolved halos with core densities above 2000 cm$^{-3}$ are impervious to both
ionizing and Lyman-Werner flux at most distances from the star and collapse as
quickly as they would in its absence. Star formation in halos of intermediate
density can be either promoted or suppressed depending on how the I-front
remnant shock compresses, deforms and enriches the core with H$_2$. We find
that the 120 M$_\odot$ star photodissociates H$_2$ in most halos in the cluster
but that catalysis by H- restores it a few hundred kyr after the death of the
star, with little effect on star formation. Our models exhibit significant
departures from previous one-dimensional spherically-symmetric simulations,
which are prone to serious errors due to unphysical geometric focusing effects.

What is the sign of muons measured by the MINOS detector?,"  A magnetic detector such as MINOS which is measuring the sign of muons has to
deal with issues of bending, which depend on the magnetic field configuration,
and multiple scattering, which depends on the amount of material which is
traversed. Above some momentum which depends on these factors, the momentum
cannot be resolved. Issues related to measurement of the muon charge ratio in
MINOS are discussed.
"
What is the Coulomb region where the nuclear scattering is dominated by the Coulomb interaction?,"  Hard high-energy pion-nucleus bremsstrahlung, $\pi^- +A\to\pi^- +\gamma +A$,
is studied in the Coulomb region, i.e. the small-angle region where the nuclear
scattering is dominated by the Coulomb interaction. Special attention is
focussed on the possibility of measuring the pion polarizability in such
reactions. We study the sensitivity to the structure of the underlying the
pion-Compton amplitude through a model with $\sigma$, $\rho$, and a_1
exchanges. It is found that the effective energy in the virtual pion-Compton
scattering is often so large that the threshold approximation does not apply.
"
What are the results of high-resolution accelerometer and laser gyroscope measurements on the vicinity of spinning rings at cryogenic temperatures?,"  High-resolution accelerometer and laser gyroscope measurements were performed
in the vicinity of spinning rings at cryogenic temperatures. After passing a
critical temperature, which does not coincide with the material's
superconducting temperature, the angular acceleration and angular velocity
applied to the rotating ring could be seen on the sensors although they are
mechanically de-coupled. A parity violation was observed for the laser
gyroscope measurements such that the effect was greatly pronounced in the
clockwise-direction only. The experiments seem to compare well with recent
independent tests obtained by the Canterbury Ring Laser Group and the
Gravity-Probe B satellite. All systematic effects analyzed so far are at least
3 orders of magnitude below the observed phenomenon. The available experimental
data indicates that the fields scale similar to classical frame-dragging
fields. A number of theories that predicted large frame-dragging fields around
spinning superconductors can be ruled out by up to 4 orders of magnitude.
"
What is the Ginzburg-Landau equation used to describe the one-dimensional Ginzburg-Landau equation?,"  The one-dimensional Ginzburg-Landau (GL) Equation is considered. We use the
recently developed extended F-expansion method to obtain spiral wave solution
of one-dimensional GL Equation.
"
What is the bifurcation diagram in the plane of parameters controlling period-doublings?,"  Structure of bifurcation diagram in the plane of parameters controlling
period-doublings for the system of coupled logistic maps is discussed. The
analysis is carried out by computing the charts of dynamical regimes and charts
of Lyapunov exponents giving showy and effective illustrations. The critical
point of codimension two at the border of chaos is found. It is a terminal
point for the Feigenbaum critical line. The bifurcation analysis in the
vicinity of this point is presented.
"
What are the modifications made to the AnITA tutoring system to make it a client/server application?,"  In the field of tutoring systems, investigations have shown that there are
many tutoring systems specific to a specific domain that, because of their
static architecture, cannot be adapted to other domains. As consequence, often
neither methods nor knowledge can be reused. In addition, the knowledge
engineer must have programming skills in order to enhance and evaluate the
system. One particular challenge is to tackle these problems with the
development of a generic tutoring system. AnITA, as a stand-alone application,
has been developed and implemented particularly for this purpose. However, in
the testing phase, we discovered that this architecture did not fully match the
user's intuitive understanding of the use of a learning tool. Therefore, AnITA
has been redesigned to exclusively work as a client/server application and
renamed to AnITA2. This paper discusses the evolvements made on the AnITA
tutoring system, the goal of which is to use generic principles for system
re-use in any domain. Two experiments were conducted, and the results are
presented in this paper.
"
What are the vortex dynamics of magnetically coupled layered superconductors described by a two-dimensional multi-layer sine-Gordon model?,"  In this paper, we propose a quantum field theoretical renormalization group
approach to the vortex dynamics of magnetically coupled layered
superconductors, to supplement our earlier investigations on the
Josephson-coupled case. We construct a two-dimensional multi-layer sine-Gordon
type model which we map onto a gas of topological excitations. With a special
choice of the mass matrix for our field theoretical model, vortex dominated
properties of magnetically coupled layered superconductors can be described.
The well known interaction potentials of fractional flux vortices are
consistently obtained from our field-theoretical analysis, and the physical
parameters (vortex fugacity and temperature parameter) are also identified. We
analyse the phase structure of the multi-layer sine--Gordon model by a
differential renormalization group method for the magnetically coupled case
from first principles. The dependence of the transition temperature on the
number of layers is found to be in agreement with known results based on other
methods.
"
What is Enrico Fermi's view of identical particles?,"  In this paper I discuss Enrico Fermi's view of identical particles, taking a
lecture that he gave in 1933 as a starting point. Fermi used his lecture as a
basis for a paper that was published in 1934: the paper is in italian and is
not easily accessible to a wide audience, and for this reason its translation
is also given in a section of the present paper.
"
What are the implications of the results for the complexity of HCP in D?,"  The Hamiltonian cycle problem (HCP) in digraphs D with degree bound two is
solved by two mappings in this paper. The first bijection is between an
incidence matrix C_{nm} of simple digraph and an incidence matrix F of balanced
bipartite undirected graph G; The second mapping is from a perfect matching of
G to a cycle of D. It proves that the complexity of HCP in D is polynomial, and
finding a second non-isomorphism Hamiltonian cycle from a given Hamiltonian
digraph with degree bound two is also polynomial. Lastly it deduces P=NP base
on the results.
"
What is the value of the disorder-averaged spin-spin correlation exponent in the +-J models studied in this paper?,"  Using mappings to computer-science problems and by applying sophisticated
algorithms, one can study numerically many problems much better compared to
applying standard approaches like Monte Carlo simulations. Here, using
calculations of ground states of suitable perturbed systems, droplets are
obtained in two-dimensional +-J spin glasses, which are in the focus of a
currently very lifely debate. Since a sophisticated matching algorithm is
applied here, exact ground states of large systems up to L^2=256^2 spins can be
generated. Furthermore, no equilibration or extrapolation to T=0 is necessary.
Three different +-J models are studied here: a) with open boundary conditions,
b) with fixed boundary conditions and c) a diluted system where a fraction
p=0.125 of all bonds is zero. For large systems, the droplet energy shows for
all three models a power-law behavior E_D L^\theta'_D with \theta'_D<0. This is
different from previous studies of domain walls, where a convergence to a
constant non-zero value (\theta_dw=0) has been found for such models. After
correcting for the non-compactness of the droplets, the results are likely to
be compatible with \theta_D= -0.29 for all three models.
  This is in accordance with the Gaussian system where \theta_D=-0.287(4)
(\nu=3.5 via \nu=-1/\theta_D). Nevertheless, the disorder-averaged spin-spin
correlation exponent \eta is determined here via the probability to have a
non-zero-energy droplet, and \eta~0.22$ is found for all three models, this
being in contrast to the behavior of the model with Gaussian interactions,
where exactly \eta=0.
"
What is the accretion model that combines radiative transfer with magnetic fields?,"  Accreting T Tauri stars are observed to be less luminous in X-rays than
non-accretors, an effect that has been detected in various star forming
regions. To explain this we have combined, for the first time, a radiative
transfer code with an accretion model that considers magnetic fields
extrapolated from surface magnetograms obtained from Zeeman-Doppler imaging.
Such fields consist of compact magnetic regions close to the stellar surface,
with extended field lines interacting with the disk. We study the propagation
of coronal X-rays through the magnetosphere and demonstrate that they are
strongly absorbed by the dense gas in accretion columns.
"
"What are the gluino and gluino masses, lifetimes, and properties?","  Long-lived, heavy particles are predicted in a number of models beyond the
standard model of particle physics. We present the first direct search for such
particles' decays, occurring up to 100 hours after their production and not
synchronized with an accelerator bunch crossing. We apply the analysis to the
gluino (~g), predicted in split supersymmetry, which after hadronization can
become charged and lose enough momentum through ionization to come to rest in
dense particle detectors. Approximately 410 pb^-1 of p-pbar collisions at 1.96
TeV collected with the D0 detector during Run II of the Fermilab Tevatron
collider are analyzed in search of such ``stopped gluinos'' decaying into a
gluon and a neutralino (~X_0), reconstructed as a jet and missing energy. No
excess is observed above background, and limits are placed on the (gluino cross
section) x (probability to stop) x BR(~g -> g ~X_0) as a function of the gluino
and ~X_0 masses, for gluino lifetimes from 30 $\mu$s -- 100 hours.
"
What are the applications of the coincidence to accidental count ratio (CAR) in photon pair generation in periodically-poled reverse-proton-exchange lithium niobate waveguides?,"  We report 10-ps correlated photon pair generation in periodically-poled
reverse-proton-exchange lithium niobate waveguides with integrated mode
demultiplexer at a wavelength of 1.5-um and a clock of 10 GHz. Using
superconducting single photon detectors, we observed a coincidence to
accidental count ratio (CAR) as high as 4000. The developed photon-pair source
may find broad application in quantum information systems as well as quantum
entanglement experiments.
"
What is the effect of underdoped YBa2Cu3Oy on the ferromagnetic ordering temperature (T_p) of SrRuO3 in bilayers?,"  The hypothesis regarding the existence of uncorrelated pre-formed pairs in
the pseudogap regime of superconducting $YBa_2Cu_3O_y$ is tested experimentally
using bilayers of $YBa_2Cu_3O_y$ and the itinerant ferromagnet $SrRuO_3$. In
our study, we monitor the influence of $YBa_2Cu_3O_y$ on $T_p$, the
ferromagnetic ordering temperature of $SrRuO_3$. Here, $T_p$ is the temperature
of maximum dM/dT or dR/dT where M and R are the magnetization and resistance of
$SrRuO_3$, respectively. We compare the results with similar measurements
carried out on bilayers of $La_{1.88}Sr_{0.12}CuO_{4-y}$, $Au$ and $Cr$ with
$SrRuO_3$. We find that in bilayers made of underdoped 10 nm $YBa_2Cu_3O_y$/5
nm $SrRuO_3$, the $T_p$ values are shifted to lower temperatures by up to 6-8 K
as compared to $T_p\approx 140$ K of the 5 nm thick reference $SrRuO_3$ film.
In contrast, in the other type of bilayers, which are not in the pseudogap
regime near $T_p$, only a smaller shift of up to $\pm$2 K is observed. These
differences are discussed in terms of a proximity effect, where carriers from
the $YBa_2Cu_3O_y$ layer are injected into the $SrRuO_3$ layer and vice versa.
We suggest that correlated electrons in the pseudogap regime of $YBa_2Cu_3O_y$
are responsible for the observed large $T_p$ shifts.
"
How can the multiplicities of D-branes be computed using the Plethystic Exponential?,"  We discuss in detail the problem of counting BPS gauge invariant operators in
the chiral ring of quiver gauge theories living on D-branes probing generic
toric CY singularities. The computation of generating functions that include
counting of baryonic operators is based on a relation between the baryonic
charges in field theory and the Kaehler moduli of the CY singularities. A study
of the interplay between gauge theory and geometry shows that given geometrical
sectors appear more than once in the field theory, leading to a notion of
""multiplicities"". We explain in detail how to decompose the generating function
for one D-brane into different sectors and how to compute their relevant
multiplicities by introducing geometric and anomalous baryonic charges. The
Plethystic Exponential remains a major tool for passing from one D-brane to
arbitrary number of D-branes. Explicit formulae are given for few examples,
including C^3/Z_3, F_0, and dP_1.
"
What are the equations of motion for a charged perfect fluid in a background electromagnetic and gravitational field?,"  n scalar-tensor theories of gravity with torsion, the gravitational field is
described in terms of a symmetric metric tensor $g$, a metric-compatible
connection $\nabla$ with torsion, and a scalar field $\phi$. The main aim is to
explore an interaction of a charged perfect fluid and a scalar field $\phi$ in
a background electromagnetic and gravitational field described by \{$g$,
$\nabla$, $\phi$\}. The interaction is based on an action functional $S_C$ of a
charged perfect fluid that is invariant under global conformal rescalings.
Using a variational principle, we obtain equations of motion for the charged
perfect fluid. Moreover, we verify that these equations of motion are
equivalent to the gauge identities obtained from the invariance of an action
functional under spacetime dffeomorphisms and a local U(1) gauge group.
"
What is the relationship between the dynamic behavior of the Ag atoms and the amplitude and period of the applied signal?,"  Based on the fact that the underpotential electrochemical deposition of Ag
atoms on the $Au(100)$ surface exhibits sharp first-order phase transitions at
well-defined values of the (coexistence) chemical potential ($\mu_{coex}$), we
performed extensive simulations aimed at investigating the hysteretic dynamic
behavior of the system close to coexistence upon the application of a periodic
signal of the form $\mu(t) = \mu_{coex} + \mu_{o}sin(2\Pi t/\tau) $, where
$\mu_{o}$ and $\tau$ are the amplitude and the period of the sweep,
respectively. For relatively short periods and small enough amplitudes the
system becomes trapped either at low or high Ag coverage states, as evidenced
by recording hysteresis loops. This scenario is identified as dynamically
ordered states (DOS), such that the relaxation time $(\tau_{relax})$ of the
corresponding metastable state obeys $\tau_{relax} > \tau $. On the other hand,
by properly increasing $\mu_{o}$ or/and $\tau$, one finds that the $Ag$
coverage gently follows the external drive (here $\tau_{relax} < \tau $) and
the system is said to enter into dynamically disordered states (DDS), where
hysteresis loops show almost symmetric limiting cycles. This symmetry breaking
between limiting cycles driven by an external signal is discussed in terms of
the concept of (out-of-equilibrium) Dynamic Phase Transitions between DOS and
DDS, similar to those encountered when a magnetic system is placed in the
presence of a variable external magnetic field. However, a careful finite-size
scaling study reveals that, at least at $T = 300K$, the $Ag/Au(100)$ system
does not exhibit true second-order phase transitions but rather a crossover
behavior between states. A diagram showing the location of the ordered and
disordered states in the $\mu$ versus $\tau$ plane is obtained and discussed.
"
What are the scale-free behavior for degree correlations and logarithmic small average path length and diameter in networks of different sizes?,"  We propose a geometric growth model for weighted scale-free networks, which
is controlled by two tunable parameters. We derive exactly the main
characteristics of the networks, which are partially determined by the
parameters. Analytical results indicate that the resulting networks have
power-law distributions of degree, strength, weight and betweenness, a
scale-free behavior for degree correlations, logarithmic small average path
length and diameter with network size. The obtained properties are in agreement
with empirical data observed in many real-life networks, which shows that the
presented model may provide valuable insight into the real systems.
"
What is the two-component Bose-Hubbard model for polaritons in an array of interacting micro-cavities?,"  We show that polaritons in an array of interacting micro-cavities with strong
atom-photon coupling can form a two-component Bose-Hubbard model. Both
polariton species are thereby protected against spontaneous emission as their
atomic part is stored in two ground states of the atoms. The parameters of the
effective model can be tuned via the driving strength of external lasers. We
also describe a method to measure the number statistics in one cavity for each
polariton species independently.
"
What is the WKB approximation used to investigate fractional systems?,"  Wentzel, Kramers, Brillouin (WKB) approximation for fractional systems is
investigated in this paper using the fractional calculus. In the fractional
case the wave function is constructed such that the phase factor is the same as
the Hamilton's principle function ""S"". To demonstrate our proposed approach two
examples are investigated in details.
"
What are the joint source/channel coding properties of a class of sparse graphical codes?,"  We describe and analyze the joint source/channel coding properties of a class
of sparse graphical codes based on compounding a low-density generator matrix
(LDGM) code with a low-density parity check (LDPC) code. Our first pair of
theorems establish that there exist codes from this ensemble, with all degrees
remaining bounded independently of block length, that are simultaneously
optimal as both source and channel codes when encoding and decoding are
performed optimally. More precisely, in the context of lossy compression, we
prove that finite degree constructions can achieve any pair $(R, D)$ on the
rate-distortion curve of the binary symmetric source. In the context of channel
coding, we prove that finite degree codes can achieve any pair $(C, p)$ on the
capacity-noise curve of the binary symmetric channel. Next, we show that our
compound construction has a nested structure that can be exploited to achieve
the Wyner-Ziv bound for source coding with side information (SCSI), as well as
the Gelfand-Pinsker bound for channel coding with side information (CCSI).
Although the current results are based on optimal encoding and decoding, the
proposed graphical codes have sparse structure and high girth that renders them
well-suited to message-passing and other efficient decoding procedures.
"
How is the associative memory of a ferrofluid formed in a training phase?,"  We analyse an associative memory based on a ferrofluid, consisting of a
system of magnetic nano-particles suspended in a carrier fluid of variable
viscosity subject to patterns of magnetic fields from an array of input and
output magnetic pads. The association relies on forming patterns in the
ferrofluid during a trainingdphase, in which the magnetic dipoles are free to
move and rotate to minimize the total energy of the system. Once equilibrated
in energy for a given input-output magnetic field pattern-pair the particles
are fully or partially immobilized by cooling the carrier liquid. Thus produced
particle distributions control the memory states, which are read out
magnetically using spin-valve sensors incorporated in the output pads. The
actual memory consists of spin distributions that is dynamic in nature,
realized only in response to the input patterns that the system has been
trained for. Two training algorithms for storing multiple patterns are
investigated. Using Monte Carlo simulations of the physical system we
demonstrate that the device is capable of storing and recalling two sets of
images, each with an accuracy approaching 100%.
"
What is the relationship between the continuity of the transition and the coupling coefficients in globally phase-coupled oscillators?,"  We investigate both continuous (second-order) and discontinuous (first-order)
transitions to macroscopic synchronization within a single class of discrete,
stochastic (globally) phase-coupled oscillators. We provide analytical and
numerical evidence that the continuity of the transition depends on the
coupling coefficients and, in some nonuniform populations, on the degree of
quenched disorder. Hence, in a relatively simple setting this class of models
exhibits the qualitative behaviors characteristic of a variety of considerably
more complicated models. In addition, we study the microscopic basis of
synchronization above threshold and detail the counterintuitive subtleties
relating measurements of time averaged frequencies and mean field oscillations.
Most notably, we observe a state of suprathreshold partial synchronization in
which time-averaged frequency measurements from individual oscillators do not
correspond to the frequency of macroscopic oscillations observed in the
population.
"
What are the unknown correlators appearing in the causal bosonic propagators?,"  The charge and spin sectors, which are intimately coupled to the fermionic
one, of the $t$-$t'$ Hubbard model have been computed self-consistently within
the two-pole approximation. The relevant unknown correlators appearing in the
causal bosonic propagators have been computed by enforcing the constraints
dictated by the hydrodynamics and the algebra of the composite operators coming
into play. The proposed scheme of approximation extends previous calculations
made for the fermionic sector of the $t$-$t'$ Hubbard model and the bosonic
sector of the Hubbard model, which showed to be very effective to describe the
overdoped region of cuprates (the former) and the magnetic response of their
parent compounds (the latter).
"
What is the relationship between transient lunar phenomena (TLPs) and outgassing events on the Moon?,"  Herein the transient lunar phenomena (TLP) report database is subjected to a
discriminating statistical filter robust against sites of spurious reports, and
produces a restricted sample that may be largely reliable. This subset is
highly correlated geographically with the catalog of outgassing events seen by
the Apollo 15, 16 and Lunar Prospector alpha-particle spectrometers for
episodic Rn-222 gas release. Both this robust TLP sample and even the larger,
unfiltered sample are highly correlated with the boundary between mare and
highlands, as are both deep and shallow moonquakes, as well as Po-210, a
long-lived product of Rn-222 decay and a further tracer of outgassing. This
offers another significant correlation relating TLPs and outgassing, and may
tie some of this activity to sagging mare basalt plains (perhaps mascons).
Additionally, low-level but likely significant TLP activity is connected to
recent, major impact craters (while moonquakes are not), which may indicate the
effects of cracks caused by the impacts, or perhaps avalanches, allowing
release of gas. The majority of TLP (and Rn-222) activity, however, is confined
to one site that produced much of the basalt in the Procellarum Terrane, and it
seems plausible that this TLP activity may be tied to residual outgassing from
the formerly largest volcanic ffusion sites from the deep lunar interior. With
the coming in the next few years of robotic spacecraft followed by human
exploration, the study of TLPs and outgassing is both promising and imperiled.
We will have an unprecedented pportunity to study lunar outgassing, but will
also deal with a greater burden of anthropogenic lunar gas than ever produced.
There is a pressing need to study lunar atmosphere and its sources while still
pristine. [Abstract abridged.]
